<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of newly built homes rose a surprising 3.4% from October to November, the Commerce Department said Wednesday, as more builders offered special deals to attract buyers, and buyers took advantage of declining interest rates and mild weather to visit model homes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the third increase in four months and a sign that the housing correction may be ending. Builder confidence levels, which hit bottom in September, are also slowly beginning to rise, according to December's Housing Market Index.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales gains haven't been easy. About half of home builders say they are cutting prices or paying the buyers' closing costs, and almost 60% are offering free upgrades such as granite kitchen counters, according to a survey by the National Association of Home Builders.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with November last year, sales were off 15%. And while December results are not yet in, sales of new homes for the year are expected to be down about 18% from 2005. Sales of existing homes should be off by almost 9% this year. The National Association of Realtors will release November's existing home sales today.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is very much like what we saw at the time of the 1990-91 recession, even though this is not a recession in economic terms," says David Seiders, chief economist for the NAHB. "It shows to what extent this market got overheated in 2004 and particularly 2005. We knew we had soared to unsustainable levels ... and knew we had one heck of a correction coming."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are still signals that home sales could continue to slide. Applications for mortgage loans last week fell 14% from the week before to their lowest level in nearly five months, the Mortgage Bankers Association said Wednesday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, sales of new homes were stronger last month in every region of the country except the South.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of new homes for sale dipped to 6.3 months, down from 6.7 months in October. "Inventories fell again for a fourth- consecutive month," Wachovia analyst Phillip Neuhart says. "As long as they continue to fall, I'm going to feel better and better about the new home market."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price for a new home was $251,700, up 3% from October and 6% from last November. But Seiders dismissed the increase, saying it was probably because sales were strongest in the Northeast and the West, where median prices for homes are the highest.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With home sales skidding even with the median price up to a gravity-defying $583,000, it's hard to believe the Los Angeles real estate market is stabilizing. But while home sales are down sharply from last year's hyperventilating pace, the sales rate in November would be right about the average if you look back over the past 18 years, says John Karevoll, an analyst at DataQuick Information Systems.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices, which continue to inch upward, have stunned nearly every market watcher. "It's astonishing," says Karevoll, who still expects prices to decline 1% to 2% in the next three to six months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"L.A. is big, and it has a huge housing stock," he says. "There are all kinds of categories: new, old, big, small, cheap, expensive. It's like turning a supertanker; it turns slowly and moves incrementally."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices at the high end of the market appear to have peaked, but demand is still fairly strong for mid- and low-price homes -- which, naturally, are all that a lot of people can afford.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lack of affordable housing in Los Angeles has reached "crisis" proportions, says Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, and the exodus of the middle class is hurting the city.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of affordable housing continued to dwindle this year despite weakening home prices, according to one-third of local housing officials who responded to a survey by the National League of Cities.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three-fourths of those surveyed say housing costs are significantly limiting home ownership opportunities for lower- income residents and young families. The survey was sent to officials in 1,167 cities.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People don't recognize the social costs of that," says James Hunt, president of the National League of Cities and a councilman in Clarksburg, W.Va. "In a lot of areas, people who can't find affordable housing are (commuting) two hours in their cars." He says cities are under pressure to address the shortage as federal aid declines, cutting into such programs as housing vouchers and community development grants.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing prices in many areas skyrocketed in recent years as interest rates dropped. Demand fueled teardowns and rehabilitation of older homes. That took cheaper housing off the market. Thousands of apartments were converted to condominiums, squeezing renters. A recent downturn in home prices in some areas hasn't offset those pressures.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower-income and middle-income working families -- including teachers and firefighters -- along with the elderly, the disabled and single parents face the most critical housing needs, according to local officials who responded to the League of Cities survey. The report is being released today at a conference in Reno.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal money for housing "has declined every single year that I've been in office," says Indianapolis Mayor Bart Peterson, who took office in 2000. "Tight funds have forced us to do creative things."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indianapolis' Fall Creek Place district once was so downtrodden it was nicknamed Dodge City. About 75% of its housing was abandoned or torn down. In the late 1990s, the neighborhood got a $4 million federal grant to boost home ownership. The city leveraged the money to attract private investment and pitched in almost $20 million to help homebuyers make down payments. Fifty homes were rehabilitated and more than 400 built. Most were sold below market rates and are owned by low-income, first-time buyers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We can now do this without the assistance of the federal government," Peterson says. "We'd love to have it, but we're not getting it, so we have to figure out a way to do it ourselves."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some cities are devoting tax revenue to housing. Others require that developments include affordable units. "If we're ... going to make a difference, we can't look to outside help," Hunt says. "We need to make a substantial investment of city dollars."  </p>

</div><div class="author">Noelle Knox  </div><div>591 words</div><div>5 December 2006</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>English</div><div>© 2006 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The state line that divides Lake Tahoe between California and Nevada also splits the real estate market in two.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lake Tahoe is the highest and largest Alpine lake in the USA, and the surrounding mountains get between 300 and 500 inches of snow a year. Nevada residents are closer to the casinos, which are legal on that side of the border; the California residents have better access to the ski resorts.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But on both sides of Lake Tahoe, at least 90% of home buyers live outside the area and are buying their second or third homes. The reason they choose one side or the other sometimes comes down to taxes: Nevada has no state income tax, and the property taxes are a bit lower. That's, in part, why price appreciation has been stronger on the Nevada side.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales, though, are down on both sides, and Nevada has seen the sharper decline. In October, the median home price on the Nevada side was roughly $735,000, up nearly 12% from the year before. But sales plunged 47%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We were soft over the summer; sales definitely dropped," says Edee Irge, an agent at Coldwell Banker Plummer on the Nevada side. "We're seeing an increase of homes going under contract. ... Buyers were waiting to see and hoping that Incline Village (on the Nevada side) would slump like Reno had, but it hasn't, so it's picking up."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Likewise, on the California side, which accounts for about two- thirds of the area's population, the median price was up 5%, to about $701,800, though home sales were off about 6%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While prices are a bit lower on the California side, they're still higher than what most year-round residents can afford. The median household income (on the California side) is about $34,000, so a lot of locals work more than one job, says Shellie Fischer of Aspen Realty.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median-price home  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This two-story wood-frame and paneled home on the California side is priced at about the October median for  </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Prices of existing homes plummet ; Dip in mortgage rates helps sales to first gain in 6 months  </span>
</div><div class="author">Noelle Knox  </div><div>536 words</div><div>29 November 2006</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>English</div><div>© 2006 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices of existing homes -- which fell a record 3.5% last month - - will likely drop further through year's end, delivering the bitter medicine needed to restore the health of the housing market, the National Association of Realtors said Tuesday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price fell in October for a third-consecutive month, to $221,000, as sellers were forced to cut prices. Those price drops, coupled with a dip in mortgage rates, seem to be reviving sales. Existing home sales ended a six-month losing streak in October, unexpectedly inching up 0.5%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices still have further to fall, says David Lereah, the NAR's chief economist. But, he notes, the faster they fall, the faster the correction in the home market will end. "The correction is working, and sales are stabilizing," Lereah says. "That's good news for the economy."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, buyers in many areas continue to enjoy an advantage. They have an ample 7.4-month supply of homes to choose from, and, "Sellers will have to overcome their state of denial and start dropping prices even more to clear this market," says Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors. "And once that happens, we will then have to convince buyers that prices have stopped falling. We are a long way from that point."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fear of falling prices keeps Christopher Robinette awake at night. Robinette, a 25-year-old engineer, wants to buy his first house in Reno but frets: "I don't want to buy and have the value of the house go down and then try to sell it at a loss. I have a job where I have the potential to move, and the value of homes is unstable at this point, and that makes me hesitant."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price for an existing single-family home in October was $221,300, down 3.4% from October last year. Sales of existing single-family homes rose 1.3% from September, though they were down 11% from October last year. Condo owners felt even more pain. The median price skidded 5.3% to $214,300. Sales fell 4.8% from September and 14.5% from 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, the Commerce Department will release October sales figures for new homes. Those figures are expected to show more weakness.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hardest hit last month were homeowners in the South, where the median price plunged 7% to $185,000 from a spike in October 2005. Sales in the South were down nearly 9% from a year ago. A big drag on the region: sales in Florida, which tumbled 22%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One surprise was in the West, where prices were nearly flat at $340,000, despite chronic affordability problems for the working class. Sales actually rose 6.4% from September to October. California's median price, the highest in the nation, gained 2% to a wallet-draining $548,680 in October from October last year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I am so confused about California," Lereah says. "You really expect California to have a big price correction. And that's not happening."  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the real estate boom, home prices in the Sun Valley area spiked almost as high as the peak of nearby Bald Mountain. The median home price is now about as high as San Francisco's.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's hardly a concern for stars such as Demi Moore, Tom Hanks and Arnold Schwarzenegger, who have second (or third or fourth) homes there. But it's a problem for working-class families in this ski resort area, who have to commute to Sun Valley from towns that have affordable housing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of homes in Sun Valley and the adjacent town of Ketchum that are priced over $2 million are holding their own right now.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the rest of the market -- with sales in the area down 50% from last year -- looks as scary as a black-diamond slope.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I've been in real estate here for 18 years," says Mia Edsall, an agent at Paragon Properties in the southern part of the valley. "I've seen it slow but never like this. There are no buyers, and the reason there are no buyers is because they can't sell the house they have. A lot of us (agents) are getting second jobs."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A redevelopment plan for downtown Ketchum calls for more- affordable housing and hotels, says Jim Figge, president of the Sawtooth Board of Realtors in Blaine County, which includes Sun Valley.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's geared toward reinvigorating our commercial and retail core," he says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local officials, Figge says, want to shift Sun Valley's image away from that of the staid, second-home retirement community it's becoming.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most-expensive home  </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Homes' losing streak to continue ; Weakness nationwide as prices fall in 45 metro areas  </span>
</div><div class="author">Noelle Knox  </div><div>559 words</div><div>21 November 2006</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>English</div><div>© 2006 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.
  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices will drop further through the end of the year, the National Association of Realtors projected Monday, after news that prices fell in 45 metro areas last summer, as weakness in the housing markets spread to more areas.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drag on median home prices has gone beyond the industrial cities, where job losses have taken a toll on housing. Now, markets in Florida, California and Arizona, where prices had shot up higher than many working families could afford, are falling back to Earth.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 45 metro areas that saw year-to-year price declines in the third quarter were the most since the NAR's record-keeping began in 1979.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We had the biggest boom ever, so you'd expect we would have the broadest price drop," says David Lereah, chief economist for the NAR. "In the fourth quarter, you are going to see a meaningful drop in every region of the country."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, the median price of an existing single-family house fell to $224,900 in the third quarter, 1.2% lower than in the same period last year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Detroit area was the worst hit; prices there fell nearly 11% in the July-September period from a year earlier. Sarasota, Fla., was second, with a 9% drop in the median single-family home price.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four Florida metro areas were among the 10 regions with the steepest price drops in the third quarter. And in California, prices fell in San Diego and Sacramento.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Florida has responded a lot quicker than California, which is good news for Florida because they're going to get the correction over with faster than California," Lereah says. "I'm not sure about California. They've got the problem of the biggest price correction to make because they have a more serious affordability problem."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, just as the real estate boom didn't lift every housing market, the slowdown isn't hitting every area. More than 100 metro areas posted price gains over the summer, including 21 that saw double-digit gains.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, the number of metro areas that suffered price declines jumped from 26 in the April-June period, and the trend could continue for the next few quarters as sellers in more cities are forced to cut prices to woo buyers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When you see a large number of metro areas posting declines," says Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors, "it tells you it's a widespread phenomenon."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the metro areas that have seen the deepest price declines this year are in such states as Michigan, Ohio and Indiana, which have suffered huge job losses in manufacturing. These are also areas where foreclosures are highest, further depressing prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though buyers in the region enjoy more opportunities now, many are reluctant to purchase because of the weak job climate in the industrial Midwest, says Mark Hull of Re/Max Realty Group in Detroit.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For sellers, it's almost a nightmare," Hull says. "A property can be marketed with every kind of tool you can think of, and unless there are really, really great incentives that make the property 20% below what the market price should be, they're just sitting there."  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners in San Antonio are selling their homes in about two months. In Detroit, by contrast, homes are sitting on the shelf for more than a year, and anxious sellers are having to cut prices to draw buyers. The National Association of Realtors released home- price data for 148 metro areas Monday, showing that the median price for a single-family home fell in 45 metro areas, and that nationally, the median price fell 1.2% from last year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether your own area has a glut of homes for sale or is posting double-digit price gains, if you're looking to buy or sell a home these days, you need to do all you can to compete. We asked the CEOs of two of the largest real estate firms in the country for their advice.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jim Gillespie  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CEO of Coldwell Banker  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Advice for sellers  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Price it right. The most important thing is to get the price right from the get-go. When homes are on the market for a long time, they get stale in the eyes of the consumer and in the eyes of the agents.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You should have your Realtor show you comparable properties that have sold in the past two to four weeks. You need to look at the most recent "comps" you have -- very similar homes in your neighborhood.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second, have your Realtor show you listing sheets of properties that have been taken off the market because they were priced too high.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Home inspection. Have a full home inspection and report on the dining room table.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Get fixed what needs fixing. The invoice that is paid to the contractors who performed the work should be there, too.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*If you're in a buyer's market, think incentives. Examples would be to help lower the buyer's interest rate, offer to pay six months or a year of real estate taxes or offer to pay a portion of the buyer's closing costs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If it's a condo or a town house, offer to pay six months or a year of the homeowner's dues. If the buyer is stretched for the loan amount, offer to pay off some of their bills so they qualify. It's good to put a deadline on your incentives.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Curb appeal. Make sure that the shrubs are trimmed, the house looks good from the outside, that there's curb appeal, and then that there are neutral colors inside. Store clutter in the basement or a storage locker.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Advice for buyers  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*There's still competition. Buyers can afford to be choosy and look over the inventory, but they must realize that if they see the house that fits their needs, they can't dillydally. Buyers need to understand this is the third-best year in history for (home) resales. There are a lot of buyers out there. Right now, they have the advantage of a lot of inventory, and until it burns off, there won't be much appreciation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In those areas where homes are depreciating, don't try to time the market, because most of the time when you time the market, you lose.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Understand your mortgage. Watch the mortgage rates and go to a lender that has a good reputation. Don't be tempted by these subprime loans (for those with impaired credit) unless you can stand the worst-case scenario, and be careful of adjustable rates for the same reason.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ask: "How often is the rate going to go up? What's the interest rate cap? Is there a prepayment penalty?"  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">---  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ron Peltier  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CEO of HomeServices of America, which owns 20 real estate firms nationwide, including Prudential California Realty  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Advice for sellers  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Pricing power. If you are selling a home characterized as a first-time-buyer home, you have an opportunity still today to price it at the high end of the range in most markets. We don't have excess inventory at the low end, so sellers could think about holding firm to that price.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As you move up the scale for discretionary buyers -- the first trade-up home -- you still have the opportunity to price your home at the upper quartile of the market, based on comparable sales.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in hot markets, sellers need to be patient given the timing. It is the lowest point of the cycle because of the holidays.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Dress it up. Make your home extremely attractive relative to the competition, by dressing up the home and making sure it's not cluttered. People really, truly buy homes on emotion. Ten feet outside the home and 10 feet inside the home, what they call curb appeal and eye appeal are really important. Making certain there is no clutter inside or outside the home will help you realize the highest value. Turn on lots of lights, play soft music, showcase the house in the most positive light.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*The open house. Make certain the home is available for showing. Oftentimes, people put in so many restrictions, it's not easy to sell. If you've got buyers who are serious, buyers this time of year, you want to accommodate them within reason.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Advice for buyers  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Know your market. If you're a first-time home buyer, you really need to be educated on what the real market facts are. There is a perspective out there that houses' values are off significantly, and in places like San Antonio, they are not. The market is solid, and homes are selling at 98% to 102% of sale price.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Think resale. Look at properties that are in attractive resale neighborhoods. Oftentimes, people think they're going to be there a long time, but the reality is things change. Have a firm offer contingent on a home inspection. People buy on emotion. But what's really important is making sure mechanical and structural components are compliant and sound.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Know your mortgage. Get prequalified for a loan, and make sure you understand different types of mortgage products. Unfortunately, people have been influenced into taking a mortgage that was an interest-only or negative amortization loan and bought to their maximum level. If that ARM resets and goes up 2 percentage points, it can dramatically change their monthly payment.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Look at new homes, too. Look at inventory of builders, because many builders have oversupply. It's very likely they are making some concessions that an individual seller, who is selling their pride and joy, would not be very likely to consider.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Tide could turn. For buyers and sellers, what we've seen across the country is a rolling boom, where it didn't hit every market at the same time or same duration, and the slowdown has hit different markets at different times. San Antonio, for example, looks pretty good, but that does not presume that it, too, won't have a bit of a slowdown sometime in the next three to six months.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction ran 11/15/2006: The Close to Home feature on Tuesday incorrectly described Michael Timmerman's position. Timmerman is the managing director in Florida for Hanley Wood Market Intelligence.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ouch. Naples' real estate market seems to be in a nose dive from last year's heights. Home sales in the first nine months of the year, for both single-family homes and condos, were off 50%. The inventory of properties on the market is up 300%, to a 21-month supply -- three times the national rate. Though the median home price is up 4% year to date, the median price fell 8% in September.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that could be good news, too. During the real estate boom, the Naples market was overrun with investors, who helped drive up prices far beyond what a median-income family could afford. "The valet parkers at hotels were buying (property on speculation) and saying they're going to flip it, and they're all getting caught," says Karen Van Arsdale, a Realtor for Premier Properties.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For middle-class buyers, the falling prices are a welcome relief, says Mike Timmerman, CEO of Hanley Wood Market Intelligence, which collects and analyzes market data.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As pricing in the market changes, and this is positive, and comes back down, we are opening up" the market to more families, Timmerman says. "We're still not going to be opening it up enough to cover that income gap, but at least we're opening it a little."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are pockets of Naples where home sales are still healthy, notably the luxury waterfront neighborhoods of Port Royal, Aqualane and Bay Colony.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though the number of single-family homes sold in Salt Lake City fell last month, the average home on the market in July to September was snapped up in just 27 days -- down from 42 days in the third quarter of last year. At the current sales pace, there's only a 2.7-month supply of homes on the market, less than half the national supply of 7.3 months.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Houston's housing market is on track to set another record this year. While sales of existing homes nationwide have fallen for the past six months, they've been rising about 12% a month, on average, in Houston.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have not had the (price) appreciation other areas have had," says Lorraine Abercrombie, chair of the Houston Association of Realtors. "We just have a lot of different opportunities and different housing around Houston. I think people can find affordable housing everywhere."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, with home prices in the area one-third below the national median, they look downright cheap. And yet prices are up 6.7% this year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, gushing oil profits don't hurt, either. Houston's economy, while more diversified now with computers, aerospace and health care, still rises and falls with the oil industry.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city, the largest in Texas with a population of more than 2 million, continues to grow. And with plenty of vacant land around, construction is keeping up with demand. Construction permits for single-family homes totaled 36,128 through August, nearly 15% more than in the first eight months of last year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median-price home  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This two-story house, built in 2005, is on the market.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Bedrooms: 4.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Bath: 2 1/2 baths.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Size: 2,164 square feet.  </p>

Houston developer Tracy Suttles and his wife, Cynthia, bought it in 2002 for $8 million but had to renegotiate their mortgage last year to avoid foreclosure, according to public records and the Houston Association of Realtors. Real Estate Properties of New York is now listed as owner of record for the 3-acre estate. It has been on the market about 500 days.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then: San Diego's housing market was so hot that the town house next to Jeff Cruce's was flipped from buyer to seller three times in three years. The owners, who never moved in, didn't even need to put up a "For Sale" sign.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now: Since August, Cruce and seven of his neighbors have put their town houses on the market (that's nearly 20% of the units in the complex). All have cut their prices, including Cruce, who chopped his price last month by $30,000 to $559,000. Not one has received an offer yet. Each time one owner would lower the asking price, it put pressure on the others to follow, says Cruce, 38, a salesman who's moving to Atlanta.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That domino effect, rippling through neighborhoods across the country, pushed down the nation's median home price in September by the largest amount on record, the National Association of Realtors (NAR) said Wednesday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price for a single-family home slipped 2.5% from September last year to $219,800, the sharpest annual drop since the NAR began tracking the data in 1969. The median-priced condominium fell 2.8% to $219,800, the fourth annual decline in a row.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the volume of home sales fell for the sixth straight month, tumbling 14% in September compared with a year ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the softest real estate markets, sellers are waking up to the harsh reality that they can't get anywhere near what their neighbors sold their homes for last year. So they're grudgingly reducing their asking prices and offering to pay closing costs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, many buyers, emboldened by the transformed market, are low-balling sellers and getting deals they couldn't have imagined last year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just ask Sevan Derderian and Reggie Johnson.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2004, Derderian bought a house in Las Vegas as an investment for $281,000. He found tenants, but he kicked them out after 10 months because their rent was always late.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I found that it's really hard to be a landlord from a state or two away," says Derderian, 43, a salesman in Los Angeles. He held onto the property for another year, hoping prices would keep going up. Once the market turned south, though, he panicked.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He listed the house in the summer for $305,000. Having owned real estate only during boom years, he assumed it would sell in about a week. After a month, he cut the price to $289,900. Another week went by. He offered to pay nearly $9,000 toward a buyer's closing costs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then along came Johnson, a 38-year-old truck driver, who snapped up the house and boasts, "I got a great deal."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Derderian, in the meantime, lost about $25,000 from paying the mortgage on an empty home.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where's the bottom?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's a risk confronting sellers in 56 metro areas, including Las Vegas, San Diego, Phoenix, New York and Miami, that are expected to suffer annual price drops, according to a study this month by Moody's Economy.com.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices in a few markets, such as Las Vegas and Portland, Ore., won't bottom out until 2009, the study projected, and in many areas prices will stay flat through the end of the decade. (For a full list, see  www.money.usatoday.com [http://www.money.usatoday.com].)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was surprising just how quickly the market seemed to turn," says Mark Zandi, chief economist for Economy.com. "It was like, boom, boom, bust. It was like, 'What happened?' The psychology in the marketplace unraveled very rapidly."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, about half of American homeowners who thought of selling their homes in the past year have delayed putting their homes on the market, according to a USA TODAY/Gallup poll conducted this month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And roughly one-third of those who had considered selling have abandoned the idea. (The poll of 1,007 adults has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, home prices aren't going to fall in every market. About one-third of the nation is expected to see moderate price growth for the rest of the year. Those areas include Dallas, Austin, Newark, Del., and Birmingham, Ala. -- areas where prices didn't test the stratosphere during the boom.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in the once-sizzling markets, homeowners and investors who bought their properties more than two years ago should still see modest gains if they sell in the current market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Relocating can be costly  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it's clearly a buyer's market now. The number of homes for sale has bulged to a 7.3-month supply compared with 4.6 months last September. The backlog of homes for sale is thickest in the areas that witnessed the fastest price growth and investor activity.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's frustrating," says Cindy Holliday, a high school math teacher who recently took a job in Chicago. "Homes were selling for so much more a few months ago, and now nothing's selling at all."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Holliday and her husband were house hunting in Chicago in June when they put their home in Ocala, Fla., up for sale.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Before we put our house on the market, houses were selling so fast we didn't think we'd have a problem selling our house at all," says Holliday, 31.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When we got back down there (to Ocala), just about every other house on our street was for sale. It was very depressing."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though their house probably would have fetched nearly $200,000 earlier this year, they listed it at $179,000. A couple of weeks ago, they trimmed the price to $174,500.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it's no easier for sellers in Chicago, says Javier Diaz. He's made several profitable real estate investments, but the three-unit apartment building he bought in Chicago earlier this year wasn't one of them.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I figured this year the property would go up 30 or 40 grand, but that didn't happen," says Diaz, 28.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He put it up for sale in September, asking $415,000. He's already cut the price twice, to $375,000. That's less than he owes on his loan, which means that if Diaz sells at that price, he'll have to pull $5,000 out of his own pocket to pay the bank.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Being a mortgage broker, Diaz knows some investors who used their home equity like debit cards. He says of the quick decline in real estate, "It's coming like a culture shock to many."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'Everyone was doing it'  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vicki di Bernardo agrees. "It taught us a lesson," she says of the downturn in Las Vegas. "It was a little risky, but we got caught up in it. Everyone was doing it. ... (Now) everyone is very, very nervous here about the real estate market."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She recalls buying a single-family home in the Las Vegas suburb of Summerlin as an investment in 2003.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We were on a huge waiting list, and our names came up, and we had to go in with a check and give it to them within a couple of hours or they'd go to the next on the list."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She rented the house out for two years. But when her tenants moved out in February, she put it on the market for $574,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In the first three months, we didn't have one showing -- not one," says di Bernardo, 60, who works in human resources. At the end of May, she dropped the price to $519,000. Three weeks later, she came down to $499,000. Even then, only looky-loos came by.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There was so much inventory" on the market, di Bernardo recalls. "So many builders had offered huge incentives, like no mortgage payments for 12 months or a swimming pool. We had it on the market for $479,000 when an offer came in at $460,000."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She grabbed it. She still made $175,000, but that's about $100,000 less than she'd have made if she sold last year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Desperate builders a problem  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders, with no emotional attachment to their homes, have become one of the biggest financial threats to individual sellers. New-home sales are down 16% this year. Building permits for single- family homes are off by 20%. Faced with a huge number of cancellations, builders began trying to lure buyers with eye- catching deals, such as free vacations, media rooms and landscaping.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's what's hurting Bryan Rauch. In January, he bought a home in Anthem, Ariz., where Pulte Homes is offering a slew of incentives, including advice from re-sale experts to help buyers fix up and sell their current homes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The plan was to renovate it and flip it," says Rauch, 37, a nurse-turned-real-estate-investor.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He put the home back on the market in February, at $284,000, then lowered the price repeatedly until he hit $270,000. Still no buyers. After six months, he rented it out at a $500-a-month loss.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The problem is the builder is giving away homes," Rauch says. "Properties like this are now selling for the low $200s."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Rauch needs to cut his losses. So he's putting the home back on the market at $260,000 and crossing his fingers -- like a lot of other sellers around the country.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slowdown in Chicago's real estate market has worsened in the past three months, and inventories are rising. There's now an eight- month supply of existing homes for sale, double last year's level and a bit higher than the national figure.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't think we're going to have a great market anytime soon, but I don't think it's going to be the bust some people are predicting," says Pam O'Connor, CEO of Leading Real Estate Companies of the World.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, she says, "You've got this sort of impasse between buyers and sellers. Sellers think their homes are still worth what they were selling for a year ago, and buyers are reading the media reports about how terrible the market is and thinking they're going to get a steal."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with last year, new home sales in Chicago and suburbs have been off about 25% each month in the past year. "It's amazing how consistent that number is," says Steve Hovany of Strategy Planning Associates, an economics and planning firm focused on housing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response, builders are canceling projects and selling excess land holdings. Construction permits for single-family homes were down 25% in August from a year ago. Though it's been a painful readjustment for the housing industry, Hovany says, "The market is probably pretty healthy, in that we are just falling back to rates of two or three years ago."  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asking prices in the Phoenix area have dropped about 25% this year, says David Khalaj, an agent at Realty Executives. Existing single-family home sales tumbled 34% in the first nine months of the year compared with the same period last year, and condo sales were off 24%. Construction permits for single-family homes were down 23% through August.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The declines appear so dramatic because Phoenix's housing market last year (and for the past several years) was so hyperinflated. "Last year was just one of those atrocities that happens rarely," in terms of bidding wars and soaring prices, says Camille Sullivan, also an agent at Realty Executives. "I've never seen it before, and I've been doing this for 25 years. It was a very difficult time."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sullivan says the market is "stabilizing and getting back to normal." There are now about 47,500 homes for sale. That's about an eight-month supply, about the national average.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the past two years, some economists have warned that the housing bubble was about to burst. Now, prices are beginning to plateau, and even fall, in some markets. This week, the Commerce Department reported that sales of new homes rose last month, but that median prices still dropped. Also, the National Association of Realtors said sales of existing homes fell for the fifth straight month. More than 3.9 million "surplus" units are available.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This worries economists because it has implications for U.S. economic growth. Home sales and related purchases account for as much as 23% of GDP, according to Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies. If the housing market slows, it follows that GDP will, too. Slower growth in housing values also means less home equity for homeowners to tap for consumer spending, which drives more than two- thirds of economic growth.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But homeowners and renters have more practical concerns: paying to keep a roof over their heads.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For one, interest rate hikes will cause a special burden on homeowners who have interest-only loans or adjustable rate mortgages. Those tottering on the financial edge can be pushed into financial ruin by just a 1% increase in the interest rate. Indeed, the Mortgage Bankers Association recently said more homeowners are falling behind on their mortgages.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There also is a class bias to a discussion of the housing bubble. Most poor folks are renters. As housing sales slow, in many instances, rents are rising. One-third of Americans spend more than 30% of their incomes, and about one in seven more than 50% of their incomes, on housing. To survive, they live in crowded or inadequate conditions and endure long commutes. Some cannot afford housing and are homeless. There is an irony that a housing surplus coexists with homelessness, but the highest-income families have increased their housing investment and are driving many of the changes in the housing market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cities not experiencing housing slowdowns ought to make sure that builders also invest in subsidized and affordable housing. Funds from the Housing and Urban Development Department should be used to develop "workforce" housing, which is affordable for those low- and moderate-income people who make cities run and who are being crowded out of the market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some sellers chafe that their property values are slowing, others are struggling with rising rents. It's important to consider both sides of the housing market when making public policy. --- Julianne Malveaux is an economist and writer.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices are projected to fall for the rest of the year, the National Association of Realtors said Monday, with sellers being forced to accept a new reality: Buyers now wield the power, with the supply of homes for sale at a 13-year high.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median-priced U.S. single-family detached home -- half cost more, half less -- fell 1.7% in August to $225,700, compared with a year ago. The decline is no doubt jarring to sellers, who haven't seen prices fall nationally since April 1995. The price drop was also sharp, the second-steepest in 38 years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes, meantime, fell for the fifth month in a row.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The housing bubble has burst; this is just the confirmation," says Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors. "The housing market is in trouble right now. I think it's finally in the process of moving toward finding a bottom," which he expects will take six months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new and existing homes, as well as building permits and new construction, are all off 10% to 25% in the past year. The confidence level of builders, who are slashing profit forecasts and seeing their stocks pounded on Wall Street, plunged this month to the lowest in 15 years, the National Association of Home Builders says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have a serious correction taking place in the housing sector," Richard Fisher, the Federal Reserve president in Dallas, said in a speech Monday. Last week, the Fed voted again to hold interest rates steady and said weakness in housing was a key factor in its decision.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This may be the most overanticipated and overanalyzed downturn in history," Fisher said. "One prominent CEO told me the only situation that's received more intense analysis than the housing market was the birth of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's baby."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the pace of the downturn has surprised several economists, including Ian Shepherdson of High Frequency Economics.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The speed of the collapse has been astonishing," Shepherdson says. "This time last year, single-family home prices were up 16.4%. With inventory still rising, there is no chance of any short-term relief. Prices and volumes have a long way to fall."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To bring buyers back into the market, sellers simply have to lower their prices, said David Lereah, the NAR's chief economist.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lereah has repeatedly cut his forecast for the housing market this year and says he's now unsure how deep the correction will turn out. Sales of existing homes fell 0.5% in August to a seasonally adjusted pace of 6.3 million. There's now a 7.5-month supply of homes for sale, up 60% from last year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If we have prices drop for the rest of the year and sales also continue to drop, then we will have a bad situation in housing of balloons popping rather than air coming out," Lereah said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Either way, he says, "It's a buyer's market."  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Though new home sales have plummeted 20% from a year ago, U.S. construction employment is still up 3%. But the solid jobs news might not last.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The trend has got to be sharply downward. The drop in home building has greatly exceeded my expectations," says Kenneth Simonson, chief economist for the Associated General Contractors of America. "I can only imagine that the August numbers stayed high because houses are still being finished, that were started" earlier.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 7.52 million U.S. workers were employed in construction in August on a seasonally adjusted basis, up from 7.31 million in August 2005 and 7.46 million in January, according to the Labor Department. Construction employment is a million above 1999.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The job market is being supported, in part, by a surge in commercial and public works projects. But residential construction hiring also rose in July and August. The national numbers obscure regional differences. In California, where the housing market is slowing, construction employment slid by about 4,000 in August. Still, in Arizona, where the housing market is also cooling, employment is up.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In our area, commercial (building) is looking good, and there's nothing in sight that's going to affect us drastically," says Jack Eberhard, owner of Careers in Construction and Development in Aurora, Colo.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eberhard can't find enough cost estimators and project engineers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview earlier this month, Richmond Federal Reserve Bank President Jeffrey Lacker cited construction employment as one reason he's not overly concerned that the housing market could fall too hard.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some workers can move from residential to commercial projects. But highly specialized workers, such as framers, who build the wood frames for houses, could have more trouble making a switch.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When things slow down, you don't necessarily let everybody go: You cut back on hours," says Dave Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders. He says it's a bit early to see the impact of the slower market, but he expects job losses.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders are carrying a 6.5-month inventory of unsold homes, according to the Commerce Department. Publicly traded builders such as Toll Bros. have been selling land or deciding not to exercise options to purchase land as the market slumps.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alex Hannigan, whose Orlando firm Hannigan Homes builds eight to nine custom houses a year, is starting to see signs of softening employment as large home builders retrench.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are now seeing some subcontractors calling us and looking for work," Hannigan says. "The Wall Street companies are taking it on the chin at the moment."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With no inventory, Hannigan is breaking ground on new homes. He expects the market to have corrected by the time construction is done in 12 to 14 months.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investing in real estate looked so sexy. Like the tech-stock bubble that turned college kids and housewives into day traders, the real estate boom turned insurance brokers, doctors and bicycle mechanics into real estate flippers, who would buy and then quickly sell homes for easy profits.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now those profits are shrinking fast. Nearly one in five flippers who sold from April to June actually lost money on the deal, the highest level in 2 1/2 years, according to HomeSmartReports.com, which today will release a report on flipping activity in 147 metro areas.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The vanishing act of speculators is accelerating the decline in home sales this year. That's making life hard for home sellers but giving buyers a bonanza of choices. It's also a stark reminder of the cyclical nature of real estate.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though it's too early to say how far the market will fall, short- term real estate investors are learning how hard it is to make money -- any money -- once For Sale signs begin hanging in yards for months. Sellers cut prices, and builders hand out swimming pools to entice hesitant buyers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take Jeffrey Epstein, an insurance broker in Florida. When Epstein put deposits down on a condo and a town house under construction in Miami in 2004, he never actually planned to live in them -- or even buy them outright.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"My strategy was just to put down a deposit and try to flip the contracts when they built the properties, which I was able to do on a couple others," says Epstein, 49. "But then I ran into a couple of problems."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Namely, a local real estate market with a 17-month supply of condos for sale and prices 11% below last year's median. In June and July, Epstein had to come up with the money to close on the condo and the town house. Now, to get them off his hands, he's offering to pay the buyers' closing costs and homeowner's association fees for a year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'll have a small profit ... but less than I thought," says Epstein, who's through with real estate investing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thousands of real estate investors across the country are saying the same thing. Investors bought about one out of every four homes sold last year, according to the National Association of Realtors. They focused on the hottest markets, such as California, Florida, Arizona and Nevada -- the very markets that are now feeling the sharpest reversals of fortune.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're nervous about what's going on in the market," says David Kloth, a doctor in Danbury, Conn., who started a real estate development firm with a lawyer a few years ago in hopes of one day changing jobs. They put down deposits on three luxury condos in Las Vegas that will be completed in November. Their hope is to flip them for a profit of 25% to 30%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've got two months to close" on the property, says Kloth, 44. "Until we sell, who knows? I don't think we'll lose money, but we won't make as much as we thought."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sharp drop in sales suggests that real estate speculators have fled the market, says Edward Leamer, director of the UCLA Anderson Forecast, a national economic prognosticator. Yet the fact that prices remain stubbornly high in most markets shows that many investors are still holding onto their properties with dreams of making a profit.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's different from the stock markets," Leamer says. "When things get bad, there's a mad dash for the door, and prices can drop rapidly.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In the home market, the investors, rather than rushing for the door, are holding onto homes imagining the market will turn around."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It reminds him of the last real estate bust in California. "In the late '80s, here in California, you couldn't go to a cocktail party without somebody admiring their own intelligence about the latest home they just bought," he recalls. Then, in the '90s, deep layoffs in the aerospace and defense industries sent the market into a tailspin.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What happened in California is a good lesson" for investors. Leamer says. "We had speculators out of the market for at least a decade."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flippers make money, but profits shrinking  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some investors are already bailing out. The number of homes for sale in the USA has hit a record. That bulging inventory both makes it hard for homeowners to sell and creates eye-catching bargains for buyers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Las Vegas, for example, the market was infested with real estate flippers during the recent real estate heyday. Roughly one out of every 10 homes sold there over the past five years was owned for just nine months or less, according to HomeSmartReports.com.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, in new neighborhoods in the Summerlin area of Las Vegas, about 40% of the single-family homes for sale are vacant, says Bruce Hiatt, owner of Luxury Realty Group. "It's higher than we expected," he says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes that were selling for $535,000 last year are going for $460,000 today.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's shocking to see, in a year's time, the price's ability to come down," Hiatt says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Falling prices have also hurt the traditional buyers who bought their homes with plans to live there and build equity the old- fashioned way. The sliding prices have made life miserable, too, for developers who are trying to sell the last homes in a project. To compete with investors on price, more builders have resorted to offers of free kitchen upgrades, landscaping, swimming pools and the like.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the cut-throat competition, flippers remain active in Las Vegas. About 6% of the homes sold in the gambling mecca from April to June had been owned for nine months or less. That put Las Vegas in seventh place for flipping activity in the second quarter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, the level of real estate flipping declined to 4.7% in the quarter, down from a high of 6.4% in the first quarter of 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those estimates would be even higher, but they include only homes owned for nine months or less. In reality, many investors buy during the construction phase (when developers offer the best deals to generate a buzz) and wait a year or two for the project to be completed before selling.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the second quarter, flippers who lost money lost a median sum of about $39,000, according to the study. Gainers, on the other hand, made a median of $42,500 -- illustrating that it's still possible for quick-turn investors to make money in soggy real estate markets.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other highlights from the second quarter:  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Ocala, Fla., and Hagerstown, Md., tied for the most flipped properties, 6.7% of home sales.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*In Truckee, Calif., about 15 miles north of Lake Tahoe, 67% of flippers lost money on their sales, the largest percentage of any metro area. Last winter's snowfall was nearly 40 feet, which may have caused some investors to think twice about the market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Flippers in Gainesville, Fla., lost the most money, a median of $63,948. Florida had three of the top four biggest median losers in the country. Gainesville, situated in the north-central part of the state, holds less appeal for investors than do coastal cities in Florida.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Flippers in Napa Valley, Calif., made the most money: $85,400. The fact that Napa is a small area and a premier wine destination helps explain the big gains.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the beginning of 2000, far more flippers have made money than lost money. But even in a frenzied market, amid bidding wars and escalation clauses in contracts, it's easy for some people to lose money -- a lot of money -- by flipping real estate.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In all but four of the last 23 quarters, the flippers who lost money lost a greater amount than the flippers who made money," says Mike Ela, president of HomeSmartReports.com, which studies flipping trends and other factors to evaluate the stability of local real estate markets.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're bombarded with 'Get Rich Through Real Estate' ads and infomercials that promise get-rich-quick opportunities," Ela says. "So much work needs to go into proper research to buy and sell."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the art of investing in real estate is being able to ride the cycles. One way of making a big return on your money is to put down as little cash as possible. But then, should you have to hang on to your property through a downturn, you might have to watch your monthly mortgage drain away your profit.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Buy the best location and have holding power, and you'll never lose," says Seth Okun, 50, a podiatrist in Tampa who has investment properties in Florida, New York and Nevada.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2004, he put down the first deposit on a unit in the MGM Grand Residences in Las Vegas, and he closed on the condo this summer for a total of $630,000. "I have it up for sale, but I'm not under any pressure. ... If somebody wants to pay the ($815,888) price for the MGM Grand Residences, fine. Otherwise, I'll keep it."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sweat-equity can pay off  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the most reliable ways to make money in real estate has been to add value to a property. Put some sweat-equity into the property by remodeling or repairing the home or landscape.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Page Musgrove, a 33-year-old bicycle mechanic in San Diego, has bought and sold several homes since 1999. He bought a duplex last September for $560,000, fixed it up and flipped it in April for $655,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He looks for homes that need work or have moisture problems. "I look for mold," he says. "That's my best friend. It will drop the price."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Musgrove puts the savings toward remodeling the bathroom, kitchen and yard but spends "no more than $40,000" on each property. He favors properties with tenants and rents that will cover the mortgage.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Musgrove is done flipping in San Diego, where home prices are now falling and there's nearly a nine-month supply of single-family homes for sale.  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders broke ground on 6% fewer homes in August to a more than three-year-low, the government reported Tuesday, stunning forecasters at how rapidly the housing boom has gone bust.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slowdown, which curtailed the number of homes entering construction to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.665 million, has come on faster than many experts expected. The consensus was for starts to fall just 1% to about 1.75 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Anyone watching the market knew this was going to come," says David Rosenberg, economist at Merrill Lynch. But, he says, it was the magnitude of the downturn that was surprising.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street apparently also was caught off guard at how quickly home building has cooled. Home-building stocks, already devastated this year, got whacked again. KB Home fell 89 cents to $45.27, Toll Bros. fell 74 cents to $27.42 and Pulte Homes fell 46 cents to $31.61. A basket of eight leading home builders has lost nearly 31%, on average, in 2006, while the benchmark Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index is up nearly 6%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question is why the slowdown has been much sharper than expected, and possible reasons include:  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Falling prices. Forecasts were too high because they didn't account for the fact that prices are falling so rapidly in some markets that buyers are walking away from homes they've agreed to buy, says Maury Harris, U.S. economist for UBS Securities. That's a staggering fact, because buyers often forfeit 5% deposits when walking away. Harris says buyers are able to find similar homes in similar neighborhoods, in some cases, for 15% less than the ones they'd agreed to buy. "You're still 10% ahead," he says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Builders' early denial. Despite signs demand was peaking in June of 2005, builders trusted their strong backlog of orders and didn't even imagine orders could be canceled, says Rosenberg. Home production wasn't cut in a meaningful way until February, he says, causing them to do it viciously now. "It's a classic case of the supply response being too late," he says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Builders' delayed reaction. Initially, home builders thought they could dampen the downturn by throwing in fancy countertops or providing discounts, says Brian Bethune, economist at Global Insight. Now, they're "grabbing the bull by the horns and adjusting the rate of production," he says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts differ on how bad the housing downturn will get before it heals. The fact that housing starts are being slashed so much will shorten the recovery period, Bethune says. "Short-term pain may avoid a more significant adjustment down the road," he says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But others see this latest disappointment as just the beginning. Rosenberg characterizes the ongoing home-building "recession" as only about halfway done. "We're not even past the fourth or fifth innings," he says.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a median sales price of $177,900, homes around the central Florida city of Ocala are a steal compared with those in many housing markets on the East Coast. Some buyers have been attracted to the slower pace of life in this town with a population of 46,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're getting a lot of buyers from New York and the Northeast who are selling their houses for $500,000 to $600,000 and coming down here and paying cash and putting a wad in the bank," says Tom Rath, an agent at Re/Max Premier. "And we're still seeing an influx of people from Southern Florida who are just tired of the crowds."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That demand helped drive up prices in Ocala by 25% in the second quarter from a year earlier, ranking it No. 2 in the nation for home price appreciation, after Baton Rouge.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the trend has likely peaked, judging from the number of "just reduced" signs around town. A big problem is the seven-month supply of properties on the market. The inventory of homes is up more than 300% from last summer.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Folks are still thinking they can get top dollar for their homes," Rath says of his recent clients. "I don't think reality has set in."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most expensive  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The outlook for the nation's housing market is even weaker than earlier projected, mainly because sellers are refusing to cut prices enough after the towering price gains of the boom years, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR's lower sales forecast followed profit warnings this week from two of the largest home builders, Beazer Homes USA and KB Home. A Federal Reserve official also indicated that interest rates might resume their upward climb, which would make it harder for buyers to afford homes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cascade of bad news weighed on stocks, which fell as investors worried about the ripple effect on the economy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Sellers are more stubborn than I expected," said David Lereah, the NAR's chief economist. "For five years in a row, it was a seller's market. They were calling all the shots, and they got accustomed to it."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR now expects sales of existing homes to fall 7.6% this year, worse than the 4.4% drop predicted in January. New home sales are projected to plunge 16% -- far below the 6% originally seen. Prices are still expected to rise above last year's highs, if just barely.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Folks are still thinking they can get top dollar for their homes," says Tom Rath, an agent at Re/Max Premier in Ocala, Fla. "I don't think reality has set in."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within months, prices are likely to cave in to the forces of supply and demand, the NAR says. A record 3.86 million homes are for sale -- a 7.3-month supply.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several builders have acknowledged being too optimistic about how many homes they could sell this year. To entice buyers, they're offering free granite counters, pools and vacations -- which eat into profits.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beazer Homes on Thursday cut its profit estimate for the year by 13% and said it's considering selling some of its land holdings. For the past two months, Beazer's sales plunged 49% from last year's levels, and half its buyers canceled. In many cases, buyers backed out because they couldn't sell their existing homes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beazer's bad news came a day after KB Home slashed its fiscal- year profit predictions by 18% from what it projected just three months ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One challenge for home buyers is today's interest rates, which have risen over the past year. Janet Yellen, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, indicated Thursday that rates might have to rise further because inflation is still "uncomfortably high."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates are about 1 point higher than they were last year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The hikes have helped to slow the housing market and hurt affordability," says Phillip Neuhart, an economic analyst at Wachovia. Another increase "may make it a little worse, but I don't think it will drop like a rock."  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Louisville, where home prices have risen from 3% to 8% almost every year since at least 1990, people watched with envy as prices soared during the real estate boom in such places as Florida, Las Vegas and California.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, with sales in those markets dropping by double digits, folks in Louisville, such as Jerry McMahan, are saying, "Thank God I'm in Kentucky."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices so far this year have risen 2.6%, and "sales are up. Not very much, but at least they're up," says McMahan, principal broker at Coldwell Banker McMahan.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes in Louisville take about 75 days to sell -- the same as last year. The segment for most first-time buyers (priced from $110,000 to $200,000) is strong. Midprice homes (up to $600,000) are selling consistently. The high end is the weakest sector, McMahan says. And there's at least one sign that the area is shifting to a buyer's market: Inventory has risen significantly, to a 6.3-month supply.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fortunately for sellers in Louisville, the area hasn't suffered the dramatic losses in manufacturing jobs that many Midwest states have. Job growth in health care and the expansion of the main air hub for UPS have helped buffer Louisville's economy, which is famous for its bourbon whiskey and the Kentucky Derby.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales posted an unexpectedly sharp drop last month to the lowest level since January 2004, and home prices fell in all regions of the country but the South, the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The downward pressure on home prices will probably continue through the beginning of 2007 because the inventory of homes for sale has surged to the highest level in 13 years. A record 3.86 million homes are for sale, a 7.3-month supply.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weakness in the market is being driven by higher interest rates, low affordability and speculators who are dumping investment properties because they couldn't flip them for a profit.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I was disappointed. It was a lot lower than I anticipated," said David Lereah, NAR's chief economist. "What is clear to me is sellers are more stubborn than I expected them to be. We definitely need a correction in prices in order for buyers to come back into the market."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He expects home prices to fall 5% nationally. He also cautioned that a few cities in Florida and California, where home prices soared to nosebleed heights, could have "hard landings."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total existing-home sales declined 4.1% from June to a seasonally adjusted pace of 6.33 million. That's down 11.2% from July last year. The median single-family home price, meaning half cost more and half cost less, was $231,200, up 1.5% from July last year, but the median condo price fell for the second month in a row and is now $225,600, down 1%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is most worrisome, however, is how the real estate markets are suffering in Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Massachusetts and some parts of Pennsylvania and New York. Job losses in those areas are pushing home sales and prices down, and foreclosures up.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That's a whole different situation for real estate. That's not a softening; that's a contraction," Lereah said. "That worries me more than anything else. It highlights the need for the (Federal Reserve) to stay the course and not raise rates. The economy is a little softer than everybody thought."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this month, the Fed voted not to raise its target for short-term interest rates again but signaled that its pause may be temporary if inflation doesn't slow down.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists, such as Roger Kubarych of HVB group, said the report strengthened the hand of Fed members arguing against further rate increases.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday's disappointing results for existing-home sales comes a day after Toll Bros., one of the nation's largest builders of new homes, said orders have dropped 48% in its most recent quarter. The Commerce Department reports today on July new home sales.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sellers in Portland, Maine, are having to cut their asking prices by about 10% because buyers won't pay more than they did last year, says Michael Flaherty, an agent with Tim Flaherty Real Estate.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both sales and prices were basically flat for the first half of the year, compared with the January-June period last year. Meantime, the inventory of homes on the market keeps rising. Realtors are also seeing a slight uptick in the number of foreclosures and distressed sales by owners who are "struggling to sell their home for (the value of) their mortgage," he says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This seaside town (population 64,000) attracts a large number of retirees and vacation-home buyers, who together account for nearly 40% of the pool of buyers.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loss of manufacturing jobs helped drive down home prices in 26 metro areas between April and June compared with the same period last year, the National Association of Realtors said Tuesday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's 10 more areas than in the first quarter, and it spotlights how joblessness in industrial states such as Illinois, Michigan, Ohio and Indiana is rippling through housing markets.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hardest-hit this year:  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Danville, Ill., where prices at which existing homes were sold fell 11% in the second quarter after a 12% drop in the first quarter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">General Motors, General Electric and Hyster, a maker of forklifts, were among the companies to close plants in Danville, leaving behind hundreds of unemployed residents. The median price for a home has fallen to $65,200 -- the cheapest in the country.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The exodus of auto, textile and other factory jobs has a direct effect on home prices. People leave town to look for work, boosting the supply of homes for sale. Others sell their homes because they can't keep up with the mortgage. At the same time, foreclosure rates in these cities are among the highest in the country, and banks are quick to cut prices to get the homes off their books.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There were a lot of divorces, a lot of single mothers -- all they could do is refinance their house or put it on the market and let it go cheap," says Jerry Urich of Century 21 Home Team Realty in Danville.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, nationwide there's no sign of any bursting real estate bubble.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most expensive areas, including Miami, San Francisco and Chicago, saw modest price gains last quarter, though the rate of increase has slowed, and a few costly cities have seen prices dip.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price for a home in the USA rose 3.7% to $227,500, while home sales fell 7% in the second quarter. Sales fell in 28 states and the District of Columbia.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But just as the real estate boom wasn't a nationwide phenomenon, the cool-down isn't affecting areas uniformly either. In 37 metro areas, home prices rose by double digits in the second quarter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Baton Rouge, for example, prices shot up 27% from the second quarter last year. In Florida, where few middle-class families can afford a home in the coastal cities, buyers are migrating to such places as Ocala, Gainesville, Jacksonville and Tampa.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're getting a lot of people from California and from South Florida -- people tired of the chaos, crowded conditions and overpriced homes," says Donna Delegal, a Jacksonville agent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California has five of the top 10 most expensive cities led by San Francisco with a median price of $751,900. But gone are the days of multiple offers and "as is" sales. Homes are sitting on the market longer. Sellers are starting to cut prices and offer incentives.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The pressure on home prices has evaporated in most areas" says David Lereah, NAR's chief economist.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's been a debate ever since Micki Seibel and Jan Leger told their friends they were going to sell their home in the heart of San Francisco and rent an apartment.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Half think it's great. The other half have been trying to talk us out of it," says Seibel, 34, who works for MyNewPlace, a new online apartment search firm.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though Seibel and Leger love their home, which they bought in 2002 for about $1 million, it's been draining them of $5,600 a month for their mortgage and taxes, when they could be renting a place just as nice in the same neighborhood for about $3,400. "We can put that savings in the bank and make it work for us and take away the risk of the unknown future of the real estate market," Seibel notes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's hard to imagine the American dream as a two-bedroom apartment with a pool, instead of a single-family home with a white picket fence. But in some of the nation's priciest real estate markets, that's what's happening. The financial reasons for renting instead of buying are the strongest they've been in 25 years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The last time home affordability fell to such an extreme was in 1981, but that was because interest rates jumped from 13% to 16%," says Hessam Nadji, a managing director for Marcus &amp; Millichap, an investment brokerage firm.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What's alarming this time is that interest rates are still historically low. That means rents need to go up, and home prices to come down in some areas, for the balance to be regained. And that may be a painful process that takes between a year to 18 months."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market was thrown out of kilter during the five-year real estate boom. Renters stampeded at the sight of an "open house" sign, trying to buy anything they could afford. Prices soared by 40%, and by even more along the coasts and in such places as Las Vegas and Phoenix. Landlords couldn't raise rents as fast, so many apartment owners simply gave up and converted their buildings into condos for sale.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So how out of whack is it now?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national median mortgage payment is $1,687 a month, nearly twice the median rent payment of $868 a month. The financial gap is even larger in cities where home prices recently rose to sky- scraping heights, such as New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Washington, according to an analysis by Marcus &amp; Millichap for USA TODAY.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though adjustable-rate and other exotic mortgages enabled families to buy homes with low-to-no down payments, many of them are still stretched to the financial limit. For a family earning the U.S. median income of $46,913, for example, owning the median-price home of $224,739 would eat up 51% of their income. Renting would require just 25%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers sit on the sidelines  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Add rising interest rates, and it's easy to see why many would- be home buyers are sitting on the sidelines and why even some homeowners are cashing out.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By renting, they gain the flexibility of a lease and freedom from home repairs. They can also invest more money in stocks, bonds and other assets that could appreciate faster than real estate over the next couple of years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For someone debating whether to rent or buy in a market that's experienced recent and substantial house-price run-up, it may be better to delay the home purchase and see what the market looks like a year or two down the road," says Stuart Gabriel, director of the Lusk Center for Real Estate at the University of Southern California.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He adds, though, "Over an extended period of time, homeownership is going to make sense for most people, most of the time."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How long is an extended period? It depends on the size of the gap between the cost of renting vs. owning.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A homeowner in Orange County, Calif., for example, would have to stay in his or her home for a decade before breaking even on out-of- pocket costs compared with renting, according to Marcus &amp; Millichap.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, on the other side of the debate, homeowners can argue that they're building wealth by investing in an asset that appreciates over time, while renters are throwing money out the window. Homeowners can also enjoy stability (with a fixed-rate mortgage), tax advantages and financial security.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'It's crazy'  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Real estate is probably the best investment any young person can make," says Yadiris Ferreira, 29, who bought a condo last month in Pembroke Pines, Fla.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, her mortgage, including homeowner association fees, totals $1,800 a month -- more than half the money she takes home as a high school math teacher. "It's crazy," Ferreira concedes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, she explains, "If I didn't buy something soon, it was going to get to the point that I couldn't afford anything."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lots of other people thought the same way during the boom years. But now home sales are falling, and in some cities, prices have started dropping, too. In June, condo prices fell 2% nationwide, and single-family home prices dipped in several markets, including San Diego, Boston and Washington.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It would be scary to buy something in a hot market and have the price just fall a few months after we buy," says Joel Coffey, a 21- year-old accountant who signed a lease last week with his wife, Katy, for an apartment in Seattle.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As more people like the Coffeys take a wait-and-see attitude, they put pressure on home sellers to cut prices. At the same time, as renters swarm the apartment market, they force up rents. This year, rents are expected to climb about 5%, and by even more in such expensive markets as Seattle, New York and San Francisco.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the Coffeys were apartment hunting, Katy, 22, called a landlord who had posted an ad on the Craigslist website. "She told me, 'You're the sixth person to contact me, and I've had it listed for 15 minutes.'"  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Manhattan,  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">the rental market looks pretty much the way the housing market did two years ago: multiple applications, dueling agents and rising prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Renting instead of buying is becoming a more popular option than it's been in a long time," says Jonathan Miller, CEO of Miller Samuel, a Manhattan appraisal company. "Landlords who have been suffering for the last four or five years are trying to make up for lost time."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rents in New York City have already climbed 5% to 20% over the past year, but that's still not enough to rebalance the market. Miller estimates that rents would have to rise an additional 20% before it would make more financial sense for renters to start buying.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In San Francisco, where the median home costs about $760,000, apartment rents have jumped 15% in the past two months, says Janan New, executive director of the San Francisco Apartment Association.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is a huge demand for apartments in San Francisco because homes are so unaffordable," she says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's still not enough to persuade Seibel and Leger to keep their home there. "We've been watching the rents," Seibel says. "But for what we're paying for our mortgage and property taxes, we could be renting a mansion in Pacific Heights."  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week's light earthquake in Northern California probably didn't scare people in San Francisco as much as the number of "For Sale" signs that have been hanging in front of homes for weeks instead of days. Sales of single-family homes plunged 21% in June, according to the most recent data available. The number of homes listed for sale has nearly doubled since the start of the year. Prices are still rising, but more sellers are simply taking their homes off the market if they can't get the price they want, says John Yen Wong, a broker at Prudential California Realty.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes priced around the median -- a heart-palpitating $760,930 -- are still selling fairly well. But sellers with homes over $1 million are adjusting their prices or taking them off the market, Wong says. "There is a capping of expectations of what sellers think they can get," he says. "They can no longer say, 'I bought it two years ago; let me tack another $100,000 onto it.'"  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most expensive  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Peter Sperling of the Apollo Group, which owns the for- profit University of Phoenix, bought this house for $32 million in 2003, it was the most expensive home ever sold in San Francisco. Now, he's put it back on the market for about twice that price. The three-level home was designed by architect Charles Young. Sperling has spent "several million" on the ongoing construction, and the buyer will have to spend at least $8 million more to finish the estate, says Sperling's agent, David Barrett. Viewings are restricted to potential buyers with a net worth of $800million or more. Neighbors include Oracle CEO Larry Ellison and oil heir Gordon Getty.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Price: $65 million  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proportion of home builders who are dangling goodies to buyers -- from free swimming pools to granite kitchen counters to vacations -- is the highest in at least seven years. The reason was made vividly clear Thursday, when the Commerce Department said new- home sales fell a sharp 3% from May to June.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales decline, the first since February, is expected to worsen in coming months, making life harder for those with "for sale" signs in their yards. That's because the number of new homes for sale is up 25% from last year, while the number of existing homes on the market has also soared.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To drive sales, 75% of builders are now offering some kind of incentives to attract buyers, up from 50% who did so last year, according to the National Association of Home Builders. "These builder-developers understand the solution to the slowdown to the market is to quickly liquidate their inventory," says Ron Peltier, CEO of HomeServices of America.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders typically prefer offering free upgrades rather than cutting prices, which can hurt resale values for their customers who bought in the same communities.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the incentive war among builders is spilling into the market for existing homes. In what may be a nascent trend, a few homeowners are starting to lure buyers with the promise of exotic trips, new cars and higher commissions for their agents.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*In Newport Beach, Calif., Paul and Sandra Findly cut the price of their home by $41,000, to $1,549,000, but they still weren't getting offers. So Paul Findly decided to offer two round-trip tickets to Hawaii to the buyer and two tickets to the buyer's agent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We needed to do something different from our competition," says Findly, a marketing director. "Honestly, this kind of thing has got to be done if people want to sell their homes. Doing typical open houses every weekend, relying on your Realtor to do everything, isn't going to work any more."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*In Las Vegas, builders are offering commissions to buyers' agents far above the typical 3%. And homeowners who wish to sell are having to follow suit. "We tell our clients they have to compete with speculators and new-home builders on commissions," says Bruce Hiatt, a local broker. His clients often offer 4% commissions, and one shelled out 5%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"On top of that, (the sellers) usually have to sprinkle in some money to help with closing costs," Hiatt says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*In Woodbridge, Va., George and Susan Garrigan listed their home for $449,000 in March. After two price reductions and still no takers, they took it off the market. They painted the interior, landscaped the yard, put in new carpet and exposed the hardwood floors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now it's back on the market for $439,000. And there's a new car in the driveway with a sign: "2006 Corolla Free with Purchase of our Beautiful Home."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You have to do something to stand out," says their agent, Barbara Tivnan. "There's so much inventory, and there's just not that many buyers."  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the first time in more than a decade, home prices could start to fall around the country in coming months, the National Association of Realtors said Tuesday after a report showed that sales of existing homes fell in June and the number of homes for sale soared to their highest point since 1997.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condo prices are already being hit: They fell 2.1% from June last year to a median $226,900 (median means half cost less and half cost more). Prices of single-family homes edged up 1.1% in June to $231,500. With a 6.8-month supply of single-family homes on the market and an eight-month supply of condos, sellers are under more pressure to cut prices, and buyers can be choosy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Lereah, NAR's chief economist, said he expects "price numbers to start deteriorating," though he still projects home prices will be up 5.3% for the year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new figures provide deeper evidence that the nation's housing market is undergoing a jarring transition from a seller's to a buyer's market. The five-year boom, which peaked in August, was driven partly by investors, who snapped up 28% of homes sold last year. Many of them now want to sell. But rising interest rates and lofty home prices have squeezed out many buyers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Prices got too high in some local markets," Lereah said. "So you're seeing two things occur: Investors are leaving quickly, and regular home buyers are staying on the sidelines."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last time single-family home prices fell was in April 1995, when they slipped 0.1%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR said June existing-home sales slipped 1.3% from May, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.62 million and were down 8.9% from June 2005. On Thursday,  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">the Commerce Department will report new home sales for June, and economists such as Phillip Neuhart of Wachovia expect those figures, too, to show continuing weakness.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The numbers are not fully counting cancellations, which builders are reporting at a very high level," Neuhart notes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many developers received approval for their projects when demand was sizzling. Now, some have to offer vacations, pools and car leases to entice buyers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For existing-home sales, the weakest region was the West, where sales plunged 17.1% from June 2005. Sales fell 9.8% in the Northeast, 6.2% in the Midwest and 5.5% in the South.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Markets which have been the hottest are quite likely to see home price declines," says John Ryding, an economist at Bear Stearns. "In those markets, you could see declines for the year."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The California Association of Realtors said Tuesday that home sales skidded 26% from June last year and are off 20% for the year. Though the median-priced home statewide hit a record $575,800, prices fell in five areas, including Santa Cruz, Palm Springs and Santa Barbara.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Affordability has probably hit a record low," says Robert Kleinhenz, deputy chief economist for CAR.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ron Peltier, CEO of HomeServices of America, adds, "There is a delayed reaction on the part of sellers to accept the new reality."  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction ran 7/28/2006: A map on 4B Tuesday incorrectly stated the performance of home sales in Charlotte. Sales in the area rose 14% from May 2005 to May 2006.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes so pricey you'll be stunned  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You may sound like Porky Pig once you hear the asking price of Prince Bandar bin Sultan's house near Aspen: a hun-a-hun-a-hundred thirty-five million dollars! If it sells for that princely sum, it will be the most expensive home in America, trumping Donald Trump's estate in Palm Beach, Fla., which is on the market for $125 million. Aspen, of course, has long served as a playground for the ultrarich, for such part-time residents as actor Robert Wagner, musician Don Henley and the late Enron chief Ken Lay, who died there earlier this month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in Aspen have been rising steadily for 2 1/2 years, says Rick Griffin, an agent at Coates Reid &amp; Waldron. There are only three single-family homes now on the market for less than $1 million. Meantime, 35 homes are on the market for prices exceeding $10 million. Toto, we are definitely not in Kansas (where the median- price home costs $78,800). The prices force about half of Aspen's 6,500 full-time residents -- teachers, nurses, city staffers -- to get some kind of housing assistance, according to the Department of Community Development.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The majority of people are buying one of their multiple homes -- it's their second, third or fourth home," Griffin explains. Buyers are often "top icons in business," "musicians" or "old money." And, no, rising interest rates don't make much difference. "It's pretty resistant, because 70% to 75% of what goes on here is done by cash," Griffin says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most expensive  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prince Bandar bin Sultan, Saudi Arabia's former ambassador to the United States, is selling this 95-acre estate.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's relief in sight for some renters as the oven-hot real estate markets cool off: A huge number of new condos could be converted into rental properties over the next 18 months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Las Vegas, Phoenix, San Diego, Washington, D.C., and much of Florida, an estimated 25% to 40% of condos under development or apartments that were converted into condos for sale will be put back on the market as rentals, says Marcus &amp; Millichap, an investment brokerage firm.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the real estate frenzy, thousands of apartment renters were forced out by landlords who converted their units into condos for sale. Last year, about 200,000 apartments were sold for conversion to condominiums, on top of 135,000 new condos.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Scottsdale, Ariz., condo conversions eliminated 15% of rental units. Vacancy rates were squeezed by the rising number of people who couldn't afford the escalating home prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As renters in sizzling markets have scrambled for anything available, rents have surged. In the Miami-Fort Lauderdale area, "Not only are rental prices up 12% to 15% in the second quarter, but the number of people signing leases is up 23% over last year," says Ron Shuffield of Esslinger-Wooten-Maxwell Realtors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent months, though, the inventory of condos for sale has swelled. And buyers have vanished. Developers are turning condo projects into apartments or canceling them. Some landlords are inviting back tenants because they can't sell the units.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all renters will get a break. In Seattle, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and Portland, Ore., there's still a supply-demand balance for condos, Marcus &amp; Millichap says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the "reconversion" trend is accelerating. In Atlanta, Lane Co. is all but abandoning condo development. Two of its current projects are now destined to be apartments.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising interest rates are making it increasingly hard to buy a home and are putting the brakes on the nation's most expensive housing markets.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest evidence came Tuesday from the National Association of Realtors, which said sales of existing homes fell 6% from January to May. The drop was worse for single-family homes, whose sales posted their steepest drop in 11 years. The number of homes for sale, meantime, rose sharply last month, a sign of slackening demand.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The one thing that's changing my forecast is the Federal Reserve," said David Lereah, the NAR's chief economist, who said he now expects home sales to fall as much as 8% this year, instead of the 5% drop he projected in January. "The market is expecting several more interest rate hikes from the Fed, and that could harm some of our nation's cooling housing markets."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed is expected to raise its target for short-term rates later this week for the 17th time in two years. Previous increases are already shutting out some buyers. Last week, the average 30- year, fixed-rate loan was at 6.7%, a four-year high, up from 5.57% a year ago. Someone who borrowed the full $230,000 for a median- priced home would have monthly principal and interest payments of $1,484 vs. $1,316 a year ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising rates are even more dangerous for people with adjustable- rate mortgages that will later reset to much higher rates. In San Diego, where the median home price is $607,000, 74% of buyers last year took out loans that let them pay only the interest or even less, according to LoanPerformance.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thirteen major metro areas face a 50% or greater chance of declining prices in the next two years, according to PMI Mortgage Insurance, which released its latest market risk index on Tuesday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, most experts see no sudden collapse of prices. "We're seeing an orderly slowdown," says Mark Milner of PMI.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May, the median price of a single-family home hit $229,700, up 6.4% from a year ago. Existing-home sales fell 1.2% from April. There's now a 6 1/2-month supply, a sign of a balanced market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising prices are scaring away investors in resort and second- home areas. The number of condos for sale in Las Vegas is up 67% from last year. The lack of investors is "the whole story of the (Las Vegas) market," says Dennis Smith of Home Builders Research. "Same in California and Phoenix."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some areas that never saw frenzied buying still report strong markets. Texas, North Carolina and New Mexico are seeing double- digit gains in home sales. Still, the confidence index of the nation's home builders has fallen to its lowest level since 1995. Monday, Lennar became the fifth home builder in recent weeks to warn investors of lower orders and more cancellations.  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2000, the cost of a median-price home has more than doubled in 30 metro areas. Chart, 2A  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN DIEGO -- Cortney Henderson is one of the faces of America's housing affordability crisis. She never could have qualified for a mortgage here -- where the median home price is $607,000 -- had she not had the $27,000 she made as an egg donor to use as "reserves" in her bank account.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Henderson, 31, who graduated last year with a Ph.D. in biomedical engineering and is now a researcher at the University of California, San Diego, still had to get a loan for the entire price of her $540,000 home. Without the $700 her boyfriend chips in each month, she could never cover the mortgage, insurance and property taxes, which still eat up almost 70% of her gross pay.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"One of the (infertile) couples said to me, 'You're helping us fulfill a dream of ours, so we hope you will use the money to fulfill a dream of yours,'" she says. "And I'm like, 'I want to buy a home. This is enabling me to buy a home. There's no way I could have done it on my own.'"  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Henderson's story points up the extremes to which some Americans are now willing to go to buy a home in some of the most overheated markets. Since 2000, the cost of a home has more than doubled in about 30 major metro areas, including Washington, New York, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Sacramento, San Diego and Atlantic City. In seven U.S. cities, the median home now costs more than a half-million dollars.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though the real estate boom peaked last year, there's no end in sight. Nationally, home prices are still climbing and are expected to rise about 5% this year. Coupled with higher interest rates, gas prices and property taxes, those prices are creating an affordability crisis that is rippling through communities across the country.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The consequences are reshaping cities and the lives of millions of Americans. They're affecting children, families, schools, hospitals, businesses and all levels of government -- from nurses, teachers and firefighters who can't afford to live in the communities where they work, to elderly renters who have been forced to leave their homes because those apartments were converted to condos they couldn't afford to buy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">San Diego could be a poster child for the affordability crisis. Home prices here have risen 142% since the start of 2000. Only 9% of residents could afford the median home if they had to put down 20% of the purchase price. Even so, a dizzying array of high-risk adjustable-rate mortgages has sustained the market by helping more people qualify.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crisis may get worse  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The affordability crisis has driven millions of people into the distant suburbs, crushing transportation networks and doubling commute times.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People who moved to Temecula, 60 miles from here, five years ago had a 60-minute commute to work (downtown); now, it's 21/2 hours," says Jim Waring, head of San Diego's land use and economic development office of the mayor. "What does that do to the family?"  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And what does that do to city services such as schools, fire departments and hospitals? Unbearable commutes, Waring says, are a "significant reason" police officers quit their jobs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The affordability crisis appears likely to get worse. The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates again this week. One in five homeowners with a mortgage has an adjustable-rate loan, and most of those loans will reset to much higher interest rates within the next two years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, there are many regions of the country, notably the Midwest, where the real estate market never turned into a feeding frenzy, and housing prices are still within reach of a working- class family. In Des Moines, for example, the median-priced home can be had for about $150,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, many Americans nationwide are growing anxious about the cost of buying a home, or even keeping the one they have. One out of three Americans fear that rising monthly payments -- especially property taxes and energy costs -- will force them to sell their home and buy a less expensive one, according to a survey to be released today by the National Association of Realtors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By a 2-to-1 margin, Americans say that high monthly payments, rather than high down payments, are the chief obstacle to buying a home, the survey found.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the renters surveyed, about half worry that the cost of housing is so daunting that they'll never be able to buy a home.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And nearly 60% of those surveyed are concerned that the cost of a home is becoming so unaffordable that it's hurting their local economy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In San Diego, biotech companies don't bother to recruit employees from outside California, because the cost of buying a home is simply too shocking, says Elizabeth Morris, CEO of the San Diego Housing Commission. Her agency helps 12,500 low-income families pay their rent each month, and there's a waiting list of 30,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment vacancy rate here is a meager 2%, yet property owners are requesting city approval to convert 16,000 apartments into condos for sale.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The senior homeless population is growing," Morris says. "We are definitely seeing an increase, because a lot of this development downtown has taken out a lot of cheap apartments and (single-room- occupancy units).  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We can argue about how good the housing was to start with, but at least it was a roof over their heads."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Julaine Anton, an 80-year-old widow, was forced out of her downtown apartment because the owner converted it to a condo. Now, she's facing that same threat in her new apartment. She needs her savings to live on, not to buy real estate. "My medical insurance, after Medicare, has gone up so much since I retired," Anton says. The $1,250 monthly rent for her two-bedroom apartment takes up all but $150 of her Social Security check.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One big risk is that the affordability crisis could accelerate the growing chasm between rich and poor, making that gap harder to cross. For most Americans, their home is their biggest asset, and one of the surest ways to build wealth. Middle-class renters in many areas could be forced to leave or see their financial prospects eroded by a lifetime of renting.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Losing the middle class  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't think we're going to have a middle class" in California, says Edward Leamer, director of the economic forecast at the University of California at Los Angeles' Anderson School of Management.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cities nationwide are losing their middle-class neighborhoods, according to a study released last week by the Brookings Institution. Middle-income neighborhoods as a proportion of all metro neighborhoods fell to 41% from 58% between 1970 and 2000 -- faster than the drop in the proportion of families earning middle incomes (between $44,000 and $66,000).  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend was worse in the 12 largest metro areas, among them Los Angeles, Baltimore and Philadelphia.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nation's real estate boom, which began in 2001 and peaked last August, has likely exacerbated this phenomenon.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This housing crisis is a crisis that is endemic not just in Los Angeles, but in big cities across the country," says Antonio Villaraigosa, mayor of Los Angeles.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A great city has a vibrant, strong middle class," he explains.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A city of rich and poor would be polarized and unable to reach its full potential as a world-class city. That's my biggest fear. If a teacher, firefighter, policeman or librarian can't buy a home and enjoy the American dream, then L.A. and cities around the nation won't be places that most of us will want to live."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The solutions are at least as complex as the problem. The debates often skirt the raw political and social issues such as income and equality, race and ethnicity. People "haven't wanted to attack it at that level because those are very uncomfortable conversations to have," says Waring in San Diego.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In super-heated markets, governments typically try to solve the problem with a variety of programs to encourage construction of low- income apartments and cheaper homes, and to offer mortgage help to working-class families, such as those of teachers and public safety workers. The most common strategies include:  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Bonuses for companies that build higher-density developments.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Housing trust funds that give financial aid to developers that build low- and moderate-income apartments.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Zoning rules that require a certain percentage of low-income housing to be included in every development.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Collecting money from developers who'd rather pay a fee to the city than build affordable housing. The city can then use that money to serve other housing programs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Financial aid for low- and moderate-income home buyers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These programs, though, are often underfunded and expensive to administer, and have a limited, though important, impact.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Villaraigosa says: "Cities haven't been aggressive enough about addressing the crisis, and neither has the state or the federal government. ... (The solution) has to be an unprecedented public- private partnership that involves all levels of government and business."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'You got a better idea?'  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He notes that he was the first mayor to fully fund the city's housing trust fund at $100 million. Since the program was launched in 2003, it has helped raise $1 billion to build 4,900 low-income apartment units.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it's pointed out that that amounts to about $204,000 a unit, and less than 1% of Los Angeles' rental stock, Villaraigosa shoots back, "Well, you got a better idea?"  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He says the affordability crisis "stems from the fact that wages haven't kept up with the cost of real estate." While average hourly wages have risen about 20% since 2000, the national median home price has soared 55%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly one in four students drop out of Los Angeles district high schools. For African-Americans, the dropout rate is 35%; for Hispanics, 25%. A study released last week by Editorial Projects in Education showed that high school students in 14 big cities -- among them Los Angeles, Detroit and New York -- have less than a 50% chance of graduating with their class.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dropouts "are never going to be able to afford a house or anything else," says Leamer, the business professor at UCLA. "So as long as we have a failure in public education, you can do all the programs you want in terms of affordable housing," and it won't make a real difference.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even for people with Ph.D.s and good career prospects, such as Henderson in San Diego, affording a home in any of the hottest markets can be a penny-pinching struggle.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a real stretch for me," she says.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of Santa Fe's nicknames is The City Different, and if nothing else, the real estate market reflects that. In this city some 7,000 feet high, the housing market is performing above the national trends. Sales are still increasing, and prices are rising by low double digits. As New Mexico's capital, Santa Fe provides a lot of government jobs, and that helps keep the real estate market stable. Real estate agents here say they see plenty of baby boomers looking for second homes. The only trace of weakness is in the upper end of the market. Homes priced from $700,000 to $900,000 are staying on the market about six months -- about 30 days longer than they did last year, says Peter Kahn of Prudential Santa Fe.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Philadelphia housing market is the strongest in the state, but sales are slowing, and there are weak pockets. From January to May, the median home price rose 13% compared with the same period last year, but home sales declined 2.2%, according to Trend MLS. There's also a glut of condos on the market (a 12- to 18-month supply), says Harry Caparo, CEO of Coldwell Banker Preferred, which has seven offices in the area. Condo prices have risen, but with a half-dozen buildings under construction, it's hard to say how long that will last. For single-family homes, there's about an eight- month supply, which is shifting the market in favor of buyers. That's especially true in the suburbs, where sales are flat. Homes priced over $1 million are also sitting on the market longer, Caparo said.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe you haven't been dreaming about moving to Des Moines. But consider this: The average commute is just 17 minutes, the unemployment rate is less than 4%, violent crime is among the lowest in the nation, and you could buy three median-priced homes for what you'd pay for one in California -- and still have money left to buy a boat. Home sales were up 13% in February and 20% in March compared with year-earlier figures. In April (the last month for which figures are available), sales were effectively flat. But looking back over the past few months, the market is continuing its traditional slow-and-steady pace. With urban renewal, warehouse- loft conversions and 2.8 miles of skywalks connecting downtown buildings, there is a new migration to downtown living.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Single-family homes in 71 U.S. cities were extremely overvalued in the first quarter of 2006 and at risk of price correction, with the costliest properties clustered in California and Florida, economists said Monday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">National City Corp. and consulting firm Global Insight in a joint study said even though the rate of home price appreciation nationally has slowed in recent months, the number of extremely overvalued markets rose 11% from 64 cities at the end of 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, the study said, markets where prices were far higher than justified based on income, employment and other variables represented 39% of all single-family housing value in the first quarter of 2006. As recently as 2004, only three markets, representing 1% of home value, were considered grossly overpriced.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Those markets that have been showing the highest appreciation rates and are most overvalued are continuing to see prices increase currently," says Jeannine Cataldi, senior economist at Global Insight.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home price appreciation on average was fastest (10.1%) in the 50 most overvalued markets during the quarter and slowest (2.7%) in the 50 most undervalued. Still, Cataldi expects a gradual, rather than abrupt slowdown in home price gains, though she adds that "some markets will see a more pronounced decline than others."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Naples, Fla., Salinas, Calif., and Port St. Lucie-Fort Pierce, Fla., were the three most overvalued markets, according to the report, while College Station, Dallas and Fort Worth were the most undervalued. The median price of $383,000 in Naples was a 102.6% overvaluation, for example, while College Station homes, at a median price of $94,000, were 24% less than the market could bear, it said. Overall, 17 of the 20 most overvalued markets are in California and Florida.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several cities, including Boston, San Francisco and San Diego, are seeing prices flatten, the study said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report tries to calculate statistically normal home values, or where house prices should be, by looking at factors in addition to price and interest rates, including employment, population density and historical premiums and discounts in cities over time.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The analysts looked at 317 metro areas accounting for 84% of U.S. single-home value. Previously, they studied 299 areas. The report, which uses price data from the federal Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO), considers cities 34% above normal prices or higher to be extremely overvalued.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to a variety of government and private data, home prices and sales are slowing from the record-setting pace of the past five years. For example, the National Association of Realtors said new home sales dipped nearly 6% in April 2006 from year-ago levels. New home prices rose 4.2% in that period. The OFHEO data show home prices rose 7.3% in the first quarter, not including refinancing. That's down from a high of 12.5% in the second quarter of 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists expect further slowing ahead, especially if the Federal Reserve keeps raising interest rates.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a forecast last week, mortgage giant Freddie Mac said the housing sector crested last fall, with construction and sales easing, and inventory of unsold homes piling up. Freddie Mac expects construction and home sales to decline 7% from 2005 levels, with 30- year fixed mortgage rates averaging 6.7% at the end of 2006 and 6.8% in 2007.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seattle's strict  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">growth-management policies and an economic rebound are buffering the region's real estate market from cooling trends. The number of new jobs has outpaced building permits for single-family homes and condos by 30% in the past 15 months. Though single-family home sales fell about 7% in April compared with April 2005, there's only a three-month supply of homes in the Seattle market -- half the national average. That's largely why prices rose nearly 18% in April, the latest data available.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The restrictions on supply by growth management (are) forcing prices artificially up," says Bill Riss, CEO of Coldwell Banker Bain. One answer to building restrictions and rising home prices may be higher-density buildings. "We're in the beginning of a building boom in mid- to high-rise condominiums," Riss says.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fort Lauderdale area has benefited from Americans' lip- smacking desire for vacation and investment properties, which accounted for easily 40% of sales in the area last year, says Ron Shuffield of Esslinger-Wooten-Maxwell Realtors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the area's scorching real estate market began to cool in September. And each month since, home sales have dropped by double digits, while the inventory of homes for sale has soared. There is now an 11.4-month supply of single-family homes, up from 1.9 months a year ago. If that number rises much more, area home prices, which have risen about 25% a year since 2001, will begin to fall, Shuffield says, though he expects single-digit appreciation this year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The picture is worse for condos, which account for more than half of home sales. Condo sales declined 37% in April compared with a year ago. And the inventory of condos for sale has shot up 386%, to a 12.3-month supply. Still, with little available land left for residential development, condo sales could account for 70% of the area's home sales within six years, Shuffield says.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're a renter trying to save for a down payment, or you're just trying to move out of your parents' home, it'll likely get harder this year. Rents are rising faster than they have in six years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apartment rents are expected to increase 5.3% this year -- about double last year's increase -- the National Association of Realtors says. That's the highest jump since 2000, when the Internet boom created lots of jobs for young adults out of college. In April, rising rents were largely to blame for a sharp jump in consumer inflation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is going to be the highest rental increase year since 2000, and it's going to be a broad-based increase in rents, not just limited to a few markets," said Hessam Nadji, who manages research for Marcus &amp; Millichap, a real estate firm in Northern California.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Renters are already facing higher energy prices and relatively moderate wage growth," Nadji says. "This is going to really squeeze a lot of households."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one needs to tell Rosa Shephard. The $1,600 rent she pays for a two-bedroom apartment in Laguna Beach, Calif., will rise by $100 a month this Friday. It's a 6.3% increase, and Shephard's salary as an administrative assistant isn't rising as much, so she's trying to find a cheaper place to live.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm trying to find a one-bedroom for $1,200," says Shephard, 53. "It just doesn't exist."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are four driving forces:  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Job growth. U.S. businesses have generated 4 million new jobs in the past two years. New hires typically look for rental property.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Rising home prices. From 1980 to 2000, the median price of a home was 12 times higher than the annual average rent. By this spring, it was 21 times higher, Nadji said. The median-priced home now costs $223,000, making the American dream a fantasy for more renters, whose competition for apartments then drives up rents. There's little relief in sight in such areas as Phoenix and South Florida, where home prices soared more than 30% in the first quarter of this year over the same quarter last year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Condo conversions. When the housing market was at its blazing peak, many investors who owned apartment buildings kicked out tenants and sold the units as condos. One out of three apartment buildings sold last year were converted into condos for sale. That took 191,400 apartments off the market, according to the NAR. In addition, the number of new apartment buildings under construction is down this year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Hurricane Katrina. About half the 100,000 displaced families in the New Orleans area haven't returned. Most of them were renters, says Lawrence Yun, an NAR economist, and "that's putting additional pressure on rental units throughout the country."

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Proving that a cooling market can still be a hot one, home prices scored double-digit gains in the first quarter of the year -- up 10.3% over the same quarter last year. The median sales price for an existing single-family house hit $217,900.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Normally, a 10% rise wouldn't signal a drop-off. But it does when compared with the fourth quarter of 2005, when the median price surged 13.6% from the same period of 2004. The first-quarter increase was down, too, from the pace for all of 2005, when prices rose 12.2%, after rising 8.3% (in 2004) and 7.5% (in 2003).  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The figures released Monday by the National Association of Realtors confirmed that the housing market is gradually slowing, with sales easing, inventories rising and construction cooling.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential housing still remains vigorous by historical measures. In the first quarter, 60 metro areas showed double-digit price gains. That was down, though, from the fourth quarter of 2005, when a record 72 metro areas saw prices rise by double digits. The NAR also said the number of homes sold, including single-family houses, condos and co-ops, fell in the first quarter. Those sales had hit a record high in the second quarter of 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, the "sentiment" of home builders slid to an 11-year low in May, the National Association of Home Builders said Monday. Its NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market index -- which measures how home builders view current and future market conditions -- fell to the lowest point since mid-1995. David Seiders, the NAHB's chief economist, sees "an orderly cooling-down process."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR agrees. The pace of price increases is slipping, it noted, even as many areas are still enjoying a robust housing market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For most metro markets, price appreciation is coming down," says Lawrence Yun, senior economist with the NAR. "The market is cooling, but to a very healthy market condition."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jim Gillespie, CEO of Coldwell Banker Real Estate, predicts price appreciation will fall to single digits soon but doesn't see any collapse of prices nationally. "The boomers are still in their prime, and they'll be buying second homes," Gillespie says. "They'll be doing that for years to come."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sixteen markets saw prices fall in the first quarter, including the Boston, Cleveland and Cincinnati metro areas. Median prices fell 1.5% to $390,400 in the Boston area; 3% to $126,800 in Cleveland; and 1.4% to $137,700 in Cincinnati.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential real estate remains red-hot in some pockets of the country, including the New Orleans area, which was devastated by Hurricane Katrina nearly a year ago.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate trends in Massachusetts start in Boston, then move west and south across the state. You can almost hear the air leaking out of the area's real estate balloon. Home sales in the greater Boston area rose in March (the most recent month for which figures were available) for the first time in six months. But home prices fell for the first three months of the year. More bad news for sellers but good news for buyers: The inventory of homes for sale rose for the 13th month in a row.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Austin, which claims to be the "Live Music Capital of the World," home sales are giving locals a lot to whistle about. The real estate market here often moves opposite to the national trend, and that's happening now. After the tech bubble burst in 2000, lots of people in Austin lost their jobs. As a result, the local real estate market drifted, even as prices in many other parts of the country rose to jaw-dropping records. Today, Austin is seeing double- digit gains, while sales in a lot of other cities are starting to sag. Such companies as Samsung, Dell and Oracle are hiring again, and the job market is strong. "That's what drives housing -- employed people," says Benny McMahan, president of the Texas Association of Realtors.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today is the debut of Close to Home, which will run in USA TODAY's Money section every Tuesday. Each week, reporter Noelle Knox will profile one metro area's real estate sales and price performance and compare them with the state and national figures. We'll also show you the kind of home you would get if you bought the median-priced house in that area. And for the real estate voyeur in all of us, we'll show you one of the most expensive homes for sale in that market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">San Diego is famous for its zoo and its beaches -- and for having had one of the USA's most overheated real estate markets last year. The median home price is still nearly three times the national average, and fewer than 10% of local residents can afford the median- priced home if they had to put 20% down, according to the California Association of Realtors. But now the market is seeing double-digit drops in monthly sales compared with last year. And while prices are still inching up, this area now has the nation's highest risk of price declines within the next two years, according to PMI Mortgage Insurance. Here's a snapshot of single-family homes for sale in the San Diego market in March, the most recent month for which figures are available:  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most expensive Art Nicholas, a former local money manager, listed his beachfront home in Del Mar in July. Price: $50 million Neighborhood: Del Mar Bedrooms: 6 Bathrooms: 9.5 Size: 10,700 square feet Features: Health spa, fireplace in the master bedroom, theater, pool, tennis court, greenhouse and two guest houses  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a sign that the U.S. real estate market "still has some legs," the number of new homes sold in March rose 13.8% vs. February, the biggest monthly increase in 13 years, the Commerce Department said Wednesday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the median price fell, and some analysts see other signs that the real estate market is slowing and prices are headed down.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, the median new-home price -- half sold for more, half for less -- was $224,200, down 2.2% from a year ago, Commerce said. It was the first time that the median price had fallen over a 12- month period since December 2003.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, nationwide, the number of homes sold was strong:  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*In the West, up 35.7%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*In the Midwest, up 10.8%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*In the South, up 6.9%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*In the Northeast, up 4.7%  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report followed one Tuesday from the National Association of Realtors, which said existing-home sales rose slightly in March vs. February. But the median price of existing homes rose 7.4% from a year ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also Tuesday, the Mortgage Bankers Association said its index of mortgage applications was at the lowest since November 2003 -- meaning fewer people are applying for loans.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's going on? Is the market up or down or both?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The market clearly has some legs left," says Lawrence Yun, senior economist for the NAR. Interest rates, though rising, are historically attractive, he says. "Buyers who were sitting on the fence, hoping mortgage rates would decline, have decided to make the move now."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers are avoiding super-expensive homes and shifting to more affordable new homes, Yun says, which is why the median sales price of new homes is down. He says strong job growth in the past two years should help the real estate market, which "has not tilted to a buyer's market yet."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others take a more sour view.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're making a rapid transition from a seller's to a buyer's market," says Jack McCabe of McCabe Research &amp; Consulting in Deerfield Beach, Fla., a specialist in condominium markets. "We've got developers offering 7% commissions to (real estate) agents. They're saying: Bring me a buyer, please!"  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overbuilding and speculation are hitting some markets hard, on the East and West Coasts and in Arizona, Nevada and Florida, he says. Miami-Dade County has 25,000 condo units under construction, 25,000 more with permits and 50,000 more units announced, he says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Miami's the poster child for the real estate bubble," McCabe says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The important trends to worry about are the growing number of homes on the market, the longer time it takes for homes to sell and the fewer mortgage applications in the pipeline, says Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist with High Frequency Economics.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The apparent strength in sales today cannot possibly last," he says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing inventory -- the number of homes on the market -- jumped 25% in March vs. last year, "the fastest increase in 33 years," Shepherdson says. Median prices of new homes were down 2.2% in March, vs. a 13.6% increase in prices as recently as October.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's an indication the real estate market "is horrible, and it's going to get really bad," Shepherdson says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yun of the NAR says the USA is now essentially two real estate markets: the coasts and Middle America.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the coasts, homes cost much more, and buyers have to stretch to buy them. As rates have risen, "it knocked them out" of the market, he says. In Middle America, home prices are still affordable, even if rates are higher.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Consumer confidence hit a four-year high in April, while existing home sales rose unexpectedly in March -- though price increases were more modest than in previous months, and the inventory of unsold homes jumped, reports Tuesday showed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data indicate that consumer spending and finances remain firm, despite rising gasoline prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing numbers pointed to an orderly slowdown after five years of record sales, though the big increase in inventory bears watching, analysts said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories rose 7% from February, even though overall sales were up 0.3% to a 6.92 million seasonally adjusted annual rate. Overall, the number of unsold homes is up 39.1% from March 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephen Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital, says the current inventory represents a 5.5-month supply. Generally, a six-month supply means a healthy balance between buyers and sellers, he says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In reality, the backup in unsold homes over the past year has (so far at least) merely brought an overheated market back into balance (stay tuned, though, it could certainly get softer)," Stanley wrote in an advisory to clients.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patrick Newport, economist at Global Insight, says inventory would have to rise much further to have a big impact on prices. Housing markets are local, and an overall inventory increase might not have any impact on a number of areas.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The housing market was really strong six months ago. Now it's not as strong as it was, but it's really fairly remarkable," Newport says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While existing home sales -- the bulk of the market -- were up from February, they were 0.7% below year-ago levels, including a 12.3% drop in the West. The median price of an existing home rose to $218,000, up 7.4% from March 2005. Sales fell 0.7% from February to March in the West and the South, and were up 1.2% in the Midwest and 1.7% in the Northeast.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Lereah, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors, expects 2006 to be the third-highest sales year on record.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also Tuesday, the New York-based Conference Board's consumer confidence index, rose to 109.6 in April from 107.5 in March, the highest since May 2002.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index, based on a survey of 5,000 households completed April 18, showed Americans were more optimistic about both current conditions and the six-month outlook.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While prices at the pump have yet to impact confidence, further increases could dampen consumers' mood," says Lynn Franco, director of The Conference Board's Consumer Research Center.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The share of consumers calling current conditions "good" rose to 29.7% from 27.9%. At the same time, those calling conditions "bad" rose to 15.1% from 14.7%. The number terming jobs "plentiful" inched to 29.1% from 28.3%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The longer-term outlook improved moderately, though the share of consumers expecting more jobs to become available in the next six months rose to 15.7% from 13.7% in March.  </p>

</div><div class="author">Noelle Knox  </div><div>630 words</div><div>5 April 2006</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>A.1</div><div>English</div><div>© 2006 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans snapping up second homes -- as investments or vacation properties -- accounted for four out of every 10 sales of existing homes last year, a record that helped drive the real estate market to new highs, according to a report being released today by the National Association of Realtors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly 28% of homes bought last year were for investment purposes, and an additional 12% were vacation homes, the figures show. Most of the buyers were baby boomers in their top earning years, looking toward retirement and hoping to build wealth or find a more desirable place to live.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Baby boomers are such a powerful economic force," said Dave Jenks, co-author of The Millionaire Real Estate Investor. "They're using their wealth to go buy second homes."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The typical investment buyer last year was 49 years old with annual income of $81,400. He or she paid $183,500 for the median- priced investment home, up 24% from 2004.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Real estate, over the past five years, has outperformed virtually every other investment vehicle," said Ron Peltier, president and chief executive of HomeServices of America, the country's second-largest residential brokerage firm. "A lot of people have just speculated in real estate."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend really started after 1997, when Congress changed the tax code, allowing most homeowners to duck capital gains taxes when they sold their homes. The exemption is $500,000 for married couples, $250,000 for singles, if it was their primary residence for two of the past five years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the old system, the only way to avoid the tax was to "roll" the gains into another home of equal or greater value. Americans bought bigger and costlier homes. But now, they can downsize and use the equity built up in their homes to buy second homes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That's what spurred all this on in the beginning," says David Lereah, the NAR's chief economist. "It's like all the stars are aligned. The tax situations helped, but at the same time, baby boomers were entering their peak earning years. That's why we just boomed in second homes."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He thinks the trend crested in 2005. With rising interest rates, tighter lending standards and slower price appreciation, Lereah expects second-home sales to drop this year to 30% of all existing- home sales, and maybe into the 20% range.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What's going to be leaving the market right now are the speculative investors who came into the market and were trying to flip homes," he said. "They were buying one, two, three or four properties at a time, and that was distorting the numbers."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of vacation homes, though, are expected to stay strong for years, because the youngest baby boomers are only 42 this year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The typical vacation home buyer last year was 52 years old, earning $82,800 a year, and purchased a property that was about 200 miles from the primary residence. The median price was $204,100, up 7.4%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than three-fourths of the buyers had no interest in renting their property. About 20% said it would one day be their retirement home.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joe Klein and his wife bought their first vacation home last year on Lake Wabedo in Minnesota, three hours from their primary residence. He says he might like to retire there but might have to persuade his wife.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's something that we could hand down to the kids," says Klein, 42, a program manager for a medical company. "But secondly, I see it as an investment. If we had to, we could sell it to help pay for their college."  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes rose an unexpected 5.2% last month, ending a five-month losing streak, as buyers took advantage of warm weather and kicked off the spring home-shopping season early, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">March, typically a strong month, is also looking good in many regions, boosting the case for a soft landing rather than a sudden plunge, in the hottest real estate markets. Early tallies from a dozen major cities across the country signal a buoyant March, though still below the levels of a year ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There may be more demand out there than people who crunched the numbers had expected," said John Karevoll of DataQuick, who analyzed the sales reported so far this month for USA TODAY.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in Southern California, where doomsayers have predicted the market will tank, home sales remain healthy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What I'm seeing from the trenches is March is looking normal: Inventory has leveled off, and sales are steady," says Phil Romero, CEO of Century 21 Award-Superstars, which has offices in that region. "There are real negotiations on both sides, concessions by both parties."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, economists expect home sales to fall for the year overall, ending a five-year feeding frenzy for housing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a nice rebound, but we have to discount some of this because of the warm weather, particularly in the Northeast," said David Lereah, the NAR's chief economist. "We may give a little of this back in the next month or two."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lereah has lowered his sales forecast for the year to a 5.7% drop because mortgage rates are rising faster than expected.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In February, buyers had to pay an average of 6.25% on a conventional 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage, up from 6.15% in January, according to Freddie Mac.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales last month hit a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 6.91 million, down from January's upwardly revised rate of 6.57 million. The sales were red-hot in the Northeast, rising about 19%. In the Midwest, sales jumped 11%, followed by the West with a 5% increase. Only the South saw sales decline, falling nearly 3%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was a little stronger than expected," said Nick Buss of PNC Bank.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department will release February's new-home sales today, and Buss said, "Given what we just saw out of existing-home sales, I wouldn't be surprised to see new-home sales slightly higher than January."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, the median home price -- half cost more, half less -- was $209,000, up nearly 11% from February 2005. The condo market recovered from a dismal January, up about 9%. The median price: $214,300, up nearly 4% from last year.  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly 70% of Americans own their homes, a record high, but the rate of homeownership for working families with children is lower than in 1978, according to a study being released today by the Center for Housing Policy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surprising trend is being driven by a combination of factors: soaring housing costs that have overshot wage increases, higher health care bills and a rise in the number of single parents.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Minority working families have struggled the most. Their homeownership rate has stagnated at 45%, far below white families (71%) as of 2003, the last year for which figures are available.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The effects are being felt in communities where teachers, police and firefighters can't afford to live in the communities where they work, if they want to own homes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some see longer-term consequences if the trend doesn't change.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You need a youthful workforce to replace people who are retiring," says Barbara Lipman of the Center for Housing Policy, the research arm of the National Housing Conference, a housing affordability advocacy group. "It's an important part of economic vitality."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop in homeownership rates for working families carries repercussions for their children, too. Studies have shown that children of homeowners are more likely to perform well in school and are less likely to have behavior problems, Lipman says. Though her researchers lacked access to Census data after 2003, Lipman says the trend seems to have persisted.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeownership for working families is highest in the Midwest, followed by the South, the Northeast and the West. That's no surprise to Sheila Harris of the Arizona Department of Housing. Home prices in that state have soared 49% since 2002, she said, while incomes have risen an average of just 3%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our governor has asked us to create a statewide task force to look for ways to create affordable housing," Harris said. The task force will focus on easing financial barriers, improving land access and providing creative financing for builders and buyers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In California, Marisela and Jose Bacaro know what a back- breaking challenge it is to have children and afford a home. Marisela, 24, works as a coordinator for Hollywood Records in Los Angeles; Jose, 25, works at a bottling plant in Los Angeles.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On their salaries, it's hard to save money while raising Alexis, 6, and Emily, 4. "With kids, they always need something," Marisela says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median home price in Los Angeles -- the point at which half of homes cost more, half less -- is $529,000, far beyond their means. Instead, they're hoping to buy a condo with no down payment and an interest-only loan of $300,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study highlights a shortage of affordable homes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are government assistance programs, but they have a diminishing influence on the housing market," says Nicolas Retsinas, director of the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A key problem, Retsinas says, is that "the labor market in our economy produces lots of low-wage jobs. There is an incredible disconnect between the housing market and the labor market."  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the allure of easy money, thousands of Americans flocked to jobs in the real estate industry during the boom years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You saw it -- there were dollar signs in their eyes," recalls Nick Vayonis, a former real estate agent in Los Angeles, where median home prices rose 145% in four years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He left the business a year ago, just in time, he says. Home sales have declined nationwide for the past five months, and sales in Southern California fell to their lowest level in five years in February, DataQuick reported Tuesday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I could see the ebb and flow. It wasn't going to be like that forever," says Vayonis, 40, who just opened a coffee shop in Canton, Ga., near Atlanta with his wife Anne-Marie, also a former agent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the housing market slows, there will likely be a lot of stories of people who are bailing out of their real estate jobs and other professions related to housing -- appraisers, mortgage brokers and home construction workers -- and many not by choice. This could send shock waves through the job market and the economy.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's because housing helped drive the economy out of the last recession. Almost four out of every 10 jobs created in the past four years were in housing-related fields. At the end of last year, a record 9.8% of U.S. workers were employed in the real estate industry, up from 8.2% a decade ago, according to Moody's Economy.com. Only the health care industry added more jobs.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Job growth is the main engine for consumer spending," says Scott Anderson, senior economist at Wells Fargo in Minneapolis.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If we don't get the job creation that we need to sustain spending, the economy could be in trouble as we get into '07," he says. "If we don't get any help from these other (non-housing) sectors, longer-term the implications are slower job growth, which means slower consumer spending, which would eventually discourage businesses from spending. You'd have this downward spiral in growth."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Belt-tightening starts   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While it's too early to tell how deeply the housing industry will contract, many companies are already seeing some business evaporate.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, Washington Mutual said it would close 10 mortgage processing centers and fire 2,500 employees. In November, mortgage company Ameriquest handed out 1,500 pink slips. The housing industry is braced for more belt-tightening.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At best, people should prepare for no pay increase and no bonus, something they have been getting a lot of. At worst, they should be thinking they may need to change occupations," says Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Economy.com in West Chester, Pa.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While it's painful for those involved, Zandi calls the slowing in housing "a necessary adjustment." The economy had gotten so dependent on housing that it needed to come down a bit to make the economy more evenly balanced.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Housing has been flying high, and it's now coming back down to earth," he says.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales fell in January for the fifth month in a row, and home builders Toll Bros. and KB Home say more buyers are canceling their orders. In all, home sales are expected to fall 8% from last year's record, according to a group of economists surveyed by USA TODAY in January.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's going to make it harder, for example, for the nation's 2.6 million real estate agents to make a living. In a "normal" real estate market, the median income for an agent in business for two years or less is $12,852, according to the National Association of Realtors. (However, it picks up rapidly after that, with agents making about $47,187, after three to five years.)   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Your income "is very unpredictable," says Janice Hofferber, who left her job as a Wall Street stock analyst in 2003 and tried her hand as an agent in Bay Head, N.J. She quit last September and became an investment adviser for Smith Barney. "You're not really building a business, you're building a reputation," explains Hofferber, 41. "There's no recurring revenue. Every year, you start at zero again. That wasn't really attractive."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was no easier in the mortgage loan business, says Toney Goucher, who closed his restaurant in Arkansas and became a mortgage broker in 2002. When he joined Leader One Financial in Kansas, home sales were hot, interest rates were low, and anyone who wasn't buying was refinancing. Last summer, the market started drying up.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It seemed like every month, we had another interest rate hike, and it got harder and harder to find clients," recalls Goucher, 55. "I joined organizations and networking groups to find more business. I called on Realtors every day -- cold calling -- I just didn't enjoy what I was doing anymore."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Goucher threw in the towel and put on an apron. After traveling to St. Louis for a conference, he opened Fat Toney's barbecue restaurant there in January.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Picking up the slack   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, the economic impact of the downturn in housing has been soft. Other sectors of the economy are adding jobs. In February, employers added workers in a broad number of industries, such as retail, health care, restaurants and bars and state and local government. If that continues, those jobs will help take up some slack if people in housing-related fields find themselves out of work.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plus, many economists expect housing to slow, but not to slide dramatically.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We don't expect housing to completely collapse," says Anthony Chan, chief economist at JPMorgan Private Client Services, adding that the housing market might regain some momentum in 2007.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are also a few trends that could reduce the blow to the economy:   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Construction. Although residential construction is weakening, commercial building is picking up, thanks to demand for new roads, government office buildings and retail shops. More than 768,000 people had jobs in the non-residential construction industry in February, the most in more than three years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The commercial market now seems to be on a pretty good upswing, and if housing loses ground, which I think is very likely, we will see some of those workers move into the non-residential side," says Dave Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the skills used in home construction are transferable to commercial building.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A carpenter can just as easily work in a non-residential building as ... a residential building," says Michael Montgomery, an economist at Global Insight in Lexington, Mass.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Hurricanes. Hurricanes last year damaged or destroyed 700,000 homes on the Gulf Coast, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, based on the number of families receiving federal housing aid.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although it's unclear how many of those homes will be rebuilt, the process of rebuilding homes, businesses, roads and other infrastructure will likely create jobs for years to come.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Refinancing. About 25% of outstanding mortgages in the fourth quarter were adjustable-rate mortgages, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For those who got into the mortgage brokerage business, that's good news. Many homeowners will likely want to refinance their mortgages in the months and years ahead to lock in a fixed rate as interest rates are expected to rise, but not by a lot.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That will kind of prop things (up) for awhile in terms of activity," Montgomery says   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And plenty of people who got into the real estate market are determined to ride out any downturn.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of them is Steve Wydler, 37, who left his job as a lawyer at AOL's headquarters in Virginia in December 2002 to join his brother, Hans, an entrepreneur with a Harvard MBA who is a real estate agent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two are getting their brokers' licenses in Virginia and Maryland so they can operate throughout the Washington, D.C., area. They now employ three people and work with four other agents as a team. He makes more money now than he did at AOL.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Personally, I'm not scared," he says. "We're not in it for the next sale. We're in it for the long haul."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But back in St. Louis, at Fat Toney's, Goucher says he has already gotten a couple of calls from mortgage brokers he knew in Kansas asking about possible franchise opportunities for his barbecue restaurant.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They say, 'You're lucky you got out.'"   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After five adrenaline-pumping years of real estate sales, 2006 is already fulfilling predictions of a weaker market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes fell in January for the fifth month in a row, the National Association of Realtors (NAR) said Tuesday. The same month, new-home sales slid 5%, the government said Monday. Builders are seeing more orders canceled. Meanwhile, the number of homeowners who are late paying their mortgages has been creeping up.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, prices are expected to rise about 5% this year despite the cooler market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"January's weak existing- and new-home sales numbers are the strongest evidence yet that after five remarkable, record-setting years, the housing market is in decline," says Patrick Newport, the U.S. economist for Global Insight.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop in home sales defied unseasonably warm weather and cash and giveaway incentives from builders that had raised hopes for a brighter showing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Imagine if the weather had been terrible," said Phillip Neuhart, economic analyst for Wachovia.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one needs to tell that to Fran Floyd. She took her Houston townhouse off the market Saturday after nearly six months -- even though she was willing to sell it for $3,400 less than she paid in 2002.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's just sad," said Floyd, 81. "I've got to sell. I don't know what I'm going to do. What I'm thinking about and praying about is renting it for a year, hoping the real estate market gets better."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately for her, the NAR projects a 5% decline in existing- home sales this year, to what would still be historically high levels.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, existing-home sales dipped 2.8%, to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 6.56 million, down 5.2% from January last year. At the same time, the number of single-family homes for sale rose to the highest since 1986 -- and 34% higher than a year ago, according to Insight Economics. That's a sign would-be buyers aren't so quick now to take the plunge.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've just got tons of inventory," and prices are coming down in Grand Rapids, Mich., said Pat Vredevoogd of AJS Realty.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One in five builders said they are seeing more cancellations of new-home orders than they did six months ago, according to the National Association of Home Builders, with 4% saying the problem is significant. To entice home shoppers, many builders are offering free TVs, swimming pools, landscaping and other incentives.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's good news for buyers, but it's bad news for sellers such as Kent Anderson. Kimball Hill, the developer of his Las Vegas community, is now offering home buyers so many incentives -- including free granite countertops and stainless steel kitchen appliances -- that Anderson had to cut his asking price on the home he bought from Kimball Hill less than a year ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As builders close out a community, those last homes are pure profit" for them, says Bruce Hiatt, Anderson's Realtor. "It really changes the comparable sales in the area."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regionally, the only bright spot in January was in the South. Sales there rose 2.6% from December's pace. Home sales suffered most in the Northeast, falling 10%. That was followed by a 7.7% drop in the Midwest and a 3.5% dip in the West. January's declines are even sharper when compared with January of last year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One key reason fewer people are buying: They can't afford to. The median price -- half cost more, half less -- was unchanged from December at $211,000 but was 11.6% higher than in January 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's clear that some homeowners are having trouble paying their mortgages. The number of homeowners who are 90 days or more behind on their primary mortgages rose to 3.6% in December, up from 3% last March, according to Loan Performance.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For subprime borrowers -- those with impaired credit who carry higher-interest loans -- the number of delinquent loans has jumped to nearly 10%.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- New home construction soared 14.5% in January to the highest level in almost 33 years as builders took advantage of record warm weather to sink their shovels into the dirt.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists, however, were quick to caution that the surprisingly high number was probably a blip in the market and continue to predict a slowdown in the housing sector this year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said Thursday that housing starts rose to a seasonally adjusted rate of 2.3 million. That's up from a revised December estimate of 2.0 million. The last time this economic indicator hit that level was in March 1973.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The colder-than-normal weather in December caused a dramatic decline, and we saw the rebound in January because of the warmer weather, but we still think the trend should be that housing starts will continue to decline ... about 5% this year," says Orawin Velz, an economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Temperatures in January averaged 39.5 degrees nationwide, the highest since at least 1895, when record-keeping began, according to the National Climatic Data Center in North Carolina  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home construction jumped the most in regions that are traditionally the coldest in January: 23.7% in the Midwest and 29.2% in the Northeast. By contrast, housing starts rose 16.9% in the West and 8.7% in the South.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke told Congress on Wednesday, "A leveling out or a modest softening of housing activity seems more likely than a sharp contraction, although significant uncertainty attends the outlook."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are signs the market for new homes remains solid. Building permits for new home construction in January rose 6.8% from December and were 3.8% higher than in January 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, there are plenty of signals the real estate market is slowing down. This week, KB Home reported home order cancellations are rising. Last week, Toll Bros., which specializes in luxury homes, said new orders have fallen sharply in the first quarter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage applications last week slid 7.3%, on a seasonally adjusted basis, to the lowest level in two years, the Mortgage Bankers Association said Wednesday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have seen large builders reduce (earnings) guidance and mortgage demand fall, so it is hard to celebrate too much the big increase in January housing starts," says Joe Naroff, president and chief economist of Naroff Economic Advisors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's getting more and more expensive to get into the housing market as the increases in short-term (interest) rates have made teaser ARMs (adjustable-rate mortgages) no longer cheap."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing affordability fell to the lowest level in more than 14 years in the fourth quarter of last year, according to the National Association of Realtors.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in the fourth quarter of 2005 posted double-digit increases in 72 metro areas -- a record number that likely marked a high point in this real estate cycle, the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, the median sales price for an existing single-family house rose to $213,000 in the fourth quarter, up 13.6% from the October-December period of 2004. But David Lereah, the NAR's chief economist, cautioned that the market is rapidly cooling.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't want to say this is the last hurrah, but it certainly reflects the peak of the boom in terms of price appreciation," Lereah said. "It wasn't the highest quarter for price appreciation ... but it covered a big part of the country -- 72 metros is enormous." Sales of existing homes are falling faster than Lereah had expected. Price appreciation could slow to single digits this quarter and will reach only 5% for the year, he predicts.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The turbocharged real estate market has been a key driver of U.S. economic growth. Ben Bernanke, the new Federal Reserve chairman, told Congress Wednesday that he would monitor the real estate market closely in assessing overall economic activity. "A leveling out or a modest softening of housing activity seems more likely than a sharp contraction, although significant uncertainty attends the outlook," Bernanke said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage applications last week slid 7.3%, on a seasonally adjusted basis, to the lowest in two years, the Mortgage Bankers Association said, lending support to market pessimists.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's looking more likely ... that we're going to get a sharp contraction," says Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In California, with four of the five costliest metro areas in the country, only 14% of households could afford the state's $548,430 median-priced single-family home (if they had to make a 20% down payment), according to the California Association of Realtors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It makes me a little concerned when you see that," says Nicholas Buss, a senior vice president at PNC Bank. But he adds, "I'm still a firm believer we're seeing a slowdown rather than a burst."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The softest market for home prices, compared with the fourth quarter of 2004, was South Bend, Ind., where the median price fell more than 5% to $89,900, meaning half sold for more, half for less. The six areas where the median price fell are suffering from job losses and poor business conditions that are weighing on the housing market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales volume for existing single-family homes in the fourth quarter was third-highest on record. The seasonally adjusted rate of 6.9 million units was flat from the fourth quarter of 2004 and off about 5% from the third quarter of 2005.  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- U.S. home sales are expected to slow in 2006, though remaining near peak levels, the National Association of Realtors said Tuesday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Realtors' chief economist David Lereah predicts existing home sales will dip 4.7% to 6.74 million units, while new home sales decline 8.5% to 1.17 million units. That would still be the third- best year on record.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another sign the housing market might be cooling after five record-setting years, luxury home builder Toll Bros. said signed contracts in the first quarter of 2006 declined 21% from the same, record period in 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Selling homes this first quarter was certainly more difficult," said CEO Robert Toll. "We experienced softening demand ... in a number of markets." Toll said activity seems to be improving, though speculative buying has eased off.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists, including Lereah, have long predicted the housing market will slow this year, partly because of Federal Reserve short- term interest rate increases, which affect mortgage rates. Prices have risen so fast in some hot markets on the East and West coasts that affordability is a problem. Government data show existing home sales drifting down in recent months, though new home sales perked up last month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A slower housing market could affect the economy by weakening construction employment and slowing consumer spending as homeowners have less ability to extract home equity.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, a report by mortgage giant Freddie Mac Tuesday indicated consumers continue to borrow against the value of their homes. Fully 80% of Freddie Mac-owned loans that were refinanced in the fourth quarter of 2005 resulted in new mortgages at least 5% higher than the original loan balance. That's up from 73% in the third quarter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The overwhelming majority of these borrowers were extracting home equity rather than trying to reduce their monthly payments," says Freddie Mac chief economist Frank Nothaft, adding consumers were using cash-out refinancing because 30-year mortgage rates near 6.25% are below home equity rates, linked to the 7.5% prime rate. People with adjustable-rate mortgages might also be refinancing into fixed-rate loans .  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Freddie Mac expects homeowners to extract $117 billion in equity from their homes in 2006, down from $243 billion in 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors predict the national median existing-home price will rise 5% this year to $219,200. The median new home price should rise 5.7% to $250,900, with a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage hitting 6.9%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Home sales are a little lower than projected, but they can be sustained around current levels," Lereah said.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the real estate market softening in many areas, more developers are trying to entice new-home buyers with freebies, from swimming pools and backyard landscaping, to flat-screen TVs and media rooms.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, 40% of home builders said they were offering some type of non-price incentive, up sharply from 28% in November 2004, according to the National Association of Home Builders.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Within the last six months, they have really increased, along with the creative use of them," says Steve Melman of the NAHB. He says the average market value of these non-financial goodies is equal to about 2.4% of the home price.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though some of the incentives were driven by year-end sales, intended to get unsold properties off the books, the real estate market has cooled in many parts of the country, and builders have become competitive.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*In Virginia, buyers can get a free flat-screen TV at one of Bozzuto Group's condo projects, or a media room in a Stanley Martin home.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*In Michigan, Winnick Homes offers a $5,000 upgrade allowance.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*In Kansas, Rodrock Development tempted buyers with $2,000 worth of backyard trees.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last three months of 2005, the pace of new-home sales dropped 15% from the third quarter and is projected to fall 4% more in the January-March period of this year, according to the NAHB.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late last year, Eric Gregory and his wife, Monica, wanted to buy a colonial-style home in Warren, Mich. The house looked better once the builder knocked $1,000 off the price and threw in $5,000 in kitchen upgrades, including hardwood flooring, for free.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you get the incentives, you put more into the house right at the beginning," Eric says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the real estate market in Michigan has slowed, incentives on homes have become as common as cash incentives on cars and trucks, says David Gans of Winnick Homes, which is building the Gregorys' house. "The consumer has been trained, to a certain extent, to say, 'OK, here's the price, but is that really the price?'"  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what makes one developer offer a 55-inch TV and another offer sod and irrigation?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We try to look at what previous homeowners have purchased in that community and try to hit the hot buttons," Gans says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These offers can save you money. But warning bells should ring if a developer offers a sweet deal only if a buyer uses an affiliated lender, title company or insurer. Many such tie-in agreements are illegal, and they might not provide a true discount, says Marc Savitt of the consumer protection committee for the National Association of Mortgage Brokers.  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales of existing homes fell in December for the third-consecutive month, in a surprisingly sharp drop that signaled the housing market is cooling off faster than expected.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home resales declined 5.7% from November to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 6.6 million, the slowest since March 2004, the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday. Western states, notably California, suffered the worst, with home sales in the region skidding 11.4% from November and from December 2004.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We got to 6.6 sooner than I expected. I hadn't expected that for two or three months," said David Lereah, chief economist for the NAR, who conceded that his forecast for 2006 might now be too optimistic. He had predicted sales of existing homes would drop 5% this year, from a record 7.07 million in 2005. The rise in home prices, meanwhile, will slow to 6% this year from 12.7% in 2005, he projected.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home buyers shelled out $211,000 for a median-priced home in December, an increase of 10.5% from the year before. But rising mortgage rates are pricing many would-be buyers out of the market, Lereah said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage was 6.27% in December, up from last year's low of 5.53% in July. The Mortgage Bankers Association predicted Wednesday that the average 30-year fixed loan would hit a high of 6.4% in the second half of this year and stay there until the end of 2007.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's bad news, in particular, for buyers in California, where prices have skyrocketed. The median price there for a single-family home was $548,430 last month, up 15.6% over a year earlier. Many buyers can afford to buy a home only with a riskier adjustable-rate or interest-only mortgage.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leslie Appleton-Young, chief economist for the California Association of Realtors, had been projecting over the past 18 months that the market would slow. Now that it has, the drop is deeper than she expected.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to higher mortgage rates, Appleton-Young blamed high oil prices and weak consumer confidence for the cooling of California's housing market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after the feeding frenzy in the California market for most of last year, the recent trend has restored sanity to the home-buying process, said Lisa Strong, an agent for Lyon Real Estate in Sacramento. "There are no fights anymore" among competing buyers and their agents, she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the South, sales of existing homes dropped 7.2%, and sales slipped 2.6% in the Midwest, from November levels. Sales were flat in the Northeast.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They were disappointing, clearly, but not a catastrophe," said Phillip Neuhart, an analyst for Wachovia. "You have to put this into perspective: 6.6 million is historically a high level. We're expecting a soft landing. We're not expecting a crash."  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- As housing prices soared last year, an eye-popping 43% of first-time home buyers purchased their homes with no-money- down loans, according to a study released Tuesday by the National Association of Realtors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend is potentially ominous. The real estate market is cooling in some areas, and rates on adjustable-rate loans are creeping up. As a result, some no-money-down buyers could owe more than their homes are worth.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median first-time home buyer scraped together a down payment of only 2% on a $150,000 home in 2005, the NAR found.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already, home prices in many areas are declining, and the "For Sale" signs are hanging in front yards longer. There's now at least a 50% risk that prices will decline within two years in 11 major metro areas, including San Diego; Boston; Long Island, N.Y.; Los Angeles; and San Francisco, according to PMI Mortgage Insurance's latest U.S. Market Risk Index.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In a number of areas, particularly on the coasts, they have a high risk of price declines in the next two years," says Mark Milner, chief risk officer of PMI.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Red-hot home building, acquisitions, remodeling and refinancing in recent years helped drive the economy and raise fears of a real estate bubble. Dean Baker of the Center for Economic and Policy Research says that if housing prices fall at least 10%, it could be even more damaging than the collapse of the high-tech stock bubble in 2000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If we do get a spike in mortgage rates, and a modest decline (in the housing market) turns into a rout, there's almost no bottom to that," Baker says. "That's a crash scenario."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Baker and other economists are concerned that many lenders have pushed a series of creative but potentially dangerous loans to help more Americans afford a home. The traditional 30-year loan with a fixed rate remains the most popular way of financing, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. But about one-third of homeowners take out riskier loans, such as interest-only or flat-minimum- payment mortgages.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These non-traditional loans transfer risk to the borrower," Milner says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NAR President Thomas Stevens says he isn't worried that nearly half of first-time home buyers put no money down, but adds, "If the number was higher than that, I'd be concerned."  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The number of previously owned homes on the market rose last month to the highest level in more than 19 years, while sales fell for the second-consecutive month, raising concerns that a housing bubble might be about to burst.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many economists said the increase in homes for sale was actually a sign that the housing market was gradually cooling rather than threatening to implode.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 2.9 million homes were on the market in the USA in November, the National Association of Realtors said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was up 14.3% from November 2004, and the highest level since April 1986.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the current sales pace, it would take five months to sell the available houses, the longest period since June 2003. The NAR estimates that the number of buyers equals the number of sellers when it takes about six months to clear the backlog.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists warned that the greater supply could signal a rapid end to the lofty home price increases seen in recent years and perhaps a decline in prices in some parts of the country. "The overhang is becoming a real threat," Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors said in a note to clients.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Naroff called the inventory figure for November a "real major warning flag for prices." But he noted that with mortgage rates still historically low, the softening in housing will likely be "orderly."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage was 6.26% last week, down from 6.33% in November, according to Freddie Mac. Although that is higher than the 5.75% seen a year earlier, rates exceeded 8% as recently as 2000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NAR chief economist David Lereah welcomed the inventory gain: "Air is coming out of the balloon, slowly. That's very healthy."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Global Insight U.S. economist Brian Bethune said, "A potentially damaging 'housing bubble' event is less likely."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For home buyers, the slowing could mean the end to bidding wars and a greater ability to negotiate on price.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phyllis Foster, 57, closed this month on a three-bedroom condominium near Detroit. She paid $237,000 for the unit, which had been on the market for six months and originally listed at $264,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her own home sold, but only after recently spending heavily on renovations -- money she did not recoup on the sale. "The market here is terrible," Foster says. "Nobody is buying."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, the number of previously owned homes sold in November fell 1.7% from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.97 million, the NAR said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices also declined. The median price for a home in the USA in November was $215,000, down 1.4% from the prior month, but still up more than 13% from a year ago. The median is the point at which half the homes sold for more and half sold for less.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But prices in the West, the most expensive housing market in the USA, rose to a median $328,000, a record high and up more than 19% from a year ago. Prices in the Northeast and the South fell in November and were flat in the Midwest.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Young, single people usually love the excitement of big cities, from the vibrant nightlife to the noisiness and frenzied pace of urban existence. They love it so much they're willing to pay a stiff price for cramped quarters and communal living.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For some, the price is getting too steep. The draw of the bright lights and big cities is dimming now that housing costs have hit exorbitant heights. Some who grew up fantasizing about life in the "big city" are settling in less glamorous cities and even suburbs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For a lot of young people, especially growing up in the Northeast, there are two cities: New York and Boston," says Nick Lentino, 31, a native of western Massachusetts.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So where is Lentino living? Hartford, Conn.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a far cry from the cosmopolitan, fast-paced ambience of New York and Boston -- but far cheaper. Lentino just bought a one- bedroom, 750-square-foot condominium in a converted 1950s apartment building a half-mile from downtown. Price: $95,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I have to be honest. There were certain times I would've loved to have been in Boston or New York," says Lentino, assistant to the director of enrollment at Goodwin College in Hartford. Even so, whenever he has pangs of regret, he goes to New York for a weekend and visits friends who are spending twice what he spends on his mortgage to rent a place half the size of his.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I can't imagine how people are able to a) save money or b) live paycheck to paycheck all year," Lentino says. "It's the same thing in Boston. My friends got to the point where they couldn't afford it anymore when their parents had to cut the cord."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Research is starting to document the housing squeeze for young people in New York and other high-octane metro areas. The Center for an Urban Future, a New York policy research group, and Mt. Auburn Associates, an economic development consulting firm, released a report recently that concluded: "The high cost of work space and housing in New York has prompted increasing numbers of artists and creative workers to decide it's simply not worth it to stay here -- especially as other cities offer enticements to relocate."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report cites New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's push for 65,000 units of new housing across the city and support for the creation of space for cultural organizations.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robin Keegan, co-author of the report, says New York may still attract young, creative types right out of college, but the question is whether they'll stay. "They get to a juncture where the cost of living is really crucial," she says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Philadelphia, sometimes the butt of jokes for its lack of cachet compared with nearby New York, is being marketed by some former residents of the Big Apple as the "next borough." It is attracting small numbers of artsy young people from expensive neighborhoods in Manhattan and Brooklyn.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cities get hip, costly  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The young haven't stopped flocking to urban jewels such as San Francisco, Chicago, Boston and New York. A recent study by CEOs for Cities, a Chicago-based organization of urban leaders, shows that young people ages 25 to 34 in the 50 largest metropolitan areas are three times more likely than they were in the 1980s to live within 3 miles of the city's center. The research is based on 2000 Census data, taken before real estate prices soared.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They're very economically important to cities," says Joe Cortright, a Portland, Ore., economist who did the research for the CEO group. "They're the dream demographics of HR (human resources) departments of fast-growing companies."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the most deeply rooted older suburbanites are rediscovering the joys of cities. Developers are converting old factories and offices into expensive lofts, and aging baby boomers with fat retirement funds and empty nests are snapping them up. Working- class city neighborhoods are being redeveloped and turning upscale.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The resurgence of cities' popularity among people of all ages is making urban living less affordable for the young and less affluent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Let's face it, bright lights aren't as bright as they used to be downtown," says William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution, a think tank. "The high priority is to have an affordable house."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several factors are pulling the young in other directions.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*The cost of housing. The U.S. median price of a single-family home was $218,000 in October, according to the National Association of Realtors. It's more than three times that in the San Francisco area ($721,900), more than twice that in New York ($461,100, and that's not including Manhattan), and about double in Boston ($430,900). Rental prices are climbing, too.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People earning the median income can afford only 2% of the homes in the Los Angeles area and 24% in Boston.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The worst enemy of a true urban renaissance has been an overhyping and overspeculation in the central city market," says Joel Kotkin, senior fellow for the New America Foundation, a think tank, and author of The City: A Global History. "They build these condos, and they're so overpriced. ... A lot of these places are not being built for young people."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Laris Kreslins, publisher of Arthur, an arts, culture and political magazine, says he got into debt living in New York. He moved back home, into the basement of his parents' house in Gaithersburg, Md., a suburb of Washington, D.C.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was a way to get back on my feet," he says. He worked part time at a private school and ran the magazine. Then he and his girlfriend, Kendra Gaeta, discovered Philadelphia. They bought a four-bedroom home near the Philadelphia Museum of Art earlier this year. Now they run a website -- movetophilly.com -- that links viewers to housing bargains and hip districts there.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In my age group and demographics, what I'm hearing is that most people work a lot, but they haven't amassed a lot of savings because most of the time they're renting and living in places like L.A. and New York," says Kreslins, 30. "They're asking, 'Why am I renting when I could be putting that same amount of money in a mortgage?'"  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Work flexibility. Employers in expensive housing markets are responding. Bill Trenchard, chief executive of LiveOps, a teleservices company based in Palo Alto, Calif., in the San Francisco Bay Area, says the company now is willing to have employees work from just about anywhere in the USA.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Wherever the brains are, wherever the talent is," he says. "That's a real change in attitude from five years ago, even two years ago when we thought there were huge advantages to having people in the building."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LiveOps has workers based as far away as Ohio. The company's employees tend to be young, many of them in their 20s and 30s.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You've got these housing markets that are completely out of whack," says Richard Florida, professor at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., and author of The Rise of the Creative Class. "There's no point of entry for young people anymore."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Florida has argued that creativity plays such a big role in the 21st-century economy that cities must adapt to the needs of creative thinkers -- whether they're artists or engineers. Letting people work where they can afford to live is one way.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seattle native Elizabeth Howie, 27, was determined to live the city life. What better place than San Francisco? A science major and graduate of UCLA, she found work with a biotech company in South San Francisco. "It was very important to live in the city, to just being young in the city ... to live in an area that had lots of restaurants and bars," she says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She was willing to pay the price: $4,200 a month rent for a three- bedroom apartment she shared with two roommates. She commuted 30 minutes to work.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was insane, but we knew we would be paying for living in the city," Howie says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leaving San Francisco  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rental market softened when the high-tech bubble popped in 2000, but she was still paying $1,100 a month and sharing a place with two others.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I saw a lot of my friends who were not living in San Francisco buying homes," she says. "I couldn't do it in San Francisco," even though her salary is in the $60,000s. "If I continued to live in the city, I don't know when I'd be able to buy a house."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Howie quit as an account manager for LiveOps and moved 90 miles away to Sacramento, the state capital that's not known as an exciting hub. She bought a three-bedroom house with a yard for $390,000. The house appreciated $50,000 in six months. She lives with her boyfriend, who opened a restaurant that appeals to the discriminating palates of Sacramento residents who fled the high cost of living in coastal California.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And LiveOps gave her her job back. She works from home in Sacramento and goes to the Palo Alto office every other week.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Urban suburbs. Most jobs now are more than 3 miles away from city centers, in suburbs and exurbs. When more people work where they live, bedroom communities take on the feel of 24-hour cities. "If your job is in the outer beltway of Houston, living downtown becomes less appealing," Kotkin says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the far suburbs of Washington, D.C., near Dulles International Airport, high-tech companies such as America Online, Oracle and others have created thousands of jobs for young professionals.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You now have options in suburbia that never existed before," Kotkin says. "If you're nomadic in the tech world, you're really moving from one suburb to another."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condos, apartments and town houses are going up around town centers on the far edges of suburbs around Washington; in Naperville, Ill., west of Chicago; and in Long Beach, the California port city south of Los Angeles. Bars, restaurants, coffeehouses and movie theaters -- the ubiquitous mainstays of bohemians and techies alike -- are sprouting in suburbia. Some of the funkiest vintage stores and boutiques are in old suburban strip malls where rents are still cheap.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You can find a little slice of bohemia everywhere -- not just in suburbs, but in second-tier and third-tier cities such as Utica (N.Y.)," says Robert Lang, director of the Metropolitan Institute at Virginia Tech.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Desire to leave home. Jill Markward, 25, grew up on Long Island, in the shadow of Manhattan. After college, she worked in marketing, but "I had to live at home because it was too expensive."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Markward loves New York's museums and arts scene, but she knew that she would have to live at home if she stayed in the area. When she got a job as a flight attendant for JetBlue Airways, she was offered two options for a home base: John F. Kennedy International Airport, 20 minutes from her parents' house, or Fort Lauderdale- Hollywood International Airport.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Markward chose Florida. She shares a two-bedroom apartment with a couple in a complex near the airport that has a swimming pool, hot tub and gym. Her share: $400 a month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If I were on Long Island, I might find a two-bedroom apartment for $1,200, but it would be in someone's basement in a suburban neighborhood," Markward says. "It would just be a room. No washer or dryer."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A survey by researchers at Stony Brook University in New York, found that 70% of Long Island residents aged 18 to 34 are considering leaving, up from 62% last year. The reasons include expensive rents because of a shortage of apartments and homes so pricey that they can't hope to buy a first home.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The percentage living with family went from 31% last year to 45% now.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's not New York City," Markward says of her new home in Hollywood, Fla. "But I can drive to Miami in 30 minutes. ... There's less traffic. The weather is nice."  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Real estate has become a hot commodity in parts of the Mountain West, as absentee investors seek comparatively cheap property and families move to the region from higher-priced areas, realtors and economists say.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, jumped 29.9% from the third quarter of 2004 through the same period in 2005. St. George, Utah, saw 31.6% price gains -- the fourth fastest in the nation, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Utah, which ranked dead last in terms of home price gains at the end of 2003, was the 22nd-fastest appreciating state. Idaho home prices rose 15.1% during the period, moving it to the rank of the 12th-fastest appreciating state.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, the Mountain region saw better than 16% price gains, faster than the national rate of 12.0%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A big part of it is a lot of outside investors. We actually have a large number of people coming in and paying cash for a property," says Todd Sankovich, chief operating officer for Century 21 Beutler and Associates in Coeur d' Alene.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sankovich says a quarter of his customers this year are from California. They're a mix of outside investors and people who made a nice profit by selling homes in the higher-priced state.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average price of a home sold through Sankovich's firm is $190,000. The median home price in California was nearly $540,000 in October, the California Association of Realtors says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keith El Bakri, a broker at ReMax First Realty in St. George, Utah, says his local market also includes a big chunk of investors and California transplants.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One investment adviser El Bakri works with has bought multiple homes in the area. But El Bakri points to strong economic growth in the area, which is located in a scenic part of Utah near national parks and outdoor recreation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bob Visini, president of marketing at LoanPerformance, a subsidiary of First American Real Estate, says it's clear investment buyers are having a major impact in some areas.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Boise, for example, 20.5% of homes bought from January through September were for investment purposes and 8.7% were purchased as second homes. Nationally, investment buyers average 9.6% of purchase loans, and second-home buyers 7.3%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales have slowed somewhat in both Idaho and Utah since the OFHEO numbers were released Dec.1, partly due to a seasonal slump. Sankovich expects the market to pick up, "but instead of ridiculous growth, you'll get sort of average growth."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, the question is whether the housing market is slowing from the torrid pace of the past five years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What we saw is a modest slowdown in our latest quarterly data, but in the past we've seen slowdowns of this magnitude completely reverse in short order," says OFHEO chief economist Patrick Lawler.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What could make the situation different this time is rising interest rates, a growing inventory of homes on the market and the fact that homes are becoming unaffordable in some U.S. regions.  </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">More housing markets called overvalued ; Report shows majority of at-risk areas in Fla., Calif.  </span>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though the number of cities where home prices are "extremely overvalued" dipped slightly in the third quarter, the percentage of the U.S. housing market considered frothy and at risk for a price correction nudged higher, a study scheduled to be released today shows.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The data suggest that the incidence of overvalued markets is becoming more concentrated," says Richard DeKaser, chief economist at National City.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study, by National City, a Cleveland-based bank, and financial information provider Global Insight, examined 299 metro areas that account for 80% of the single-family home market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DeKaser defines "extremely overvalued" as 30% higher than he estimates prices should be based on historical price data, incomes, mortgage rates and population density.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of significantly overvalued cities fell to 65 last quarter vs. 67 in the second quarter, but the percentage of the market with out-of-whack home prices rose to 38%, up from 35% at the end of June.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The findings come amid reports of slowing sales and moderating prices around the country.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the second straight quarter, Naples, Fla., topped the list, with homes 84% overvalued. The rest of the top five: Merced, Calif., 76.7%; Salinas, Calif., 74.8%; Port St. Lucie, Fla., 72.2%; and Stockton, Calif., 72.0%  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DeKaser stresses that does not imply homes there will suffer a 70% or 80%-plus collapse. He notes that price corrections are generally about "half" the magnitude of the total overvaluation. Even declines of that size are unlikely unless an economic shock occurs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newcomers to the "at-risk" list include Phoenix, 34.8% overvalued; Pensacola, Fla., 33.2%; Orlando, 32.7%; and Honolulu, 31.3%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A surprising 41 of the 65 significantly overvalued markets were in California and Florida.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also noteworthy: A few cities previously deemed very frothy dropped off the list. Worcester and Essex County, Mass., are no longer 30% overvalued, a sign that cooling is underway in many previously red-hot markets. Also dropping off the overvalued list: Jackson, Miss.; Bay City, Mich.; Portland, Maine; and Charlottesville, Va.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're beginning to see more diversity among metro areas," says DeKaser, noting that not all markets are getting more pricey as they were in 2003 and 2004. "We are seeing places like Massachusetts reverting back to normal, and places like Arizona and Florida doing precisely the opposite."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What remains to be seen, DeKaser says, is whether the most overvalued markets will have an orderly price correction to more normal, historic price levels -- or more painful declines.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study's 30% threshold for seriously overvalued markets is based on the typical degree of frothiness that preceded 63 known price declines since 1985.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home buyers in search of undervalued real estate may want to go house hunting in College Station, Texas, where prices are 23% below what the data suggest they should be. Other undervalued cities: Charleston, S.C., undervalued by 7%; Charlotte, 6%; Huntsville, Ala., 11%; and Lafayette, Ind., 10%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The slower pace of appreciation suggests that a return to normal valuations lies ahead," says Philip Hopkins, managing director of U.S. regional services at Global Insight.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The U.S. housing industry is in for a sustained decline, though signs of a cool-down have been slower to emerge than previously expected, according to the quarterly UCLA Anderson Forecast released Wednesday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The widely respected forecasting center at UCLA said rising interest rates, slowing population growth, overbuilding and the fact that prices had reached bubble-like heights in some hot areas will drive the decline. Housing, which had been a big driver of growth, is contributing little to the economic expansion at present, the forecast said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While a sharper slowdown in housing will hurt the broader economy, it is not expected to push it into recession, the economists said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The remaining questions are how hard the fall will be and when it will begin," Michael Bazdarich, senior economist at the UCLA Anderson Forecast, said in a report. "The recent anecdotal evidence suggests the decline may be beginning. We'll soon see for sure," he said. Previously, UCLA Anderson Forecast economists had predicted that housing construction would begin to slow in mid-2005, a projection it later pushed back to early 2006.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are signs that the market has begun to cool, including a decline in existing home sales and softening prices for home- builder stocks. But Bazdarich said it was "still too early to call the turn."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along those lines, the Mortgage Bankers Association said Wednesday that mortgage applications rose in the past week. The demand for purchase loans rose for the third time in four weeks, while mortgage refinance demand firmed for the first time in nearly two months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Edward Leamer, director of the UCLA Anderson Forecast, noted that eight of the past 10 economic recessions were started by housing- market slowdowns. But, he said, loss of spending on housing alone would not be enough to trigger a recession.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while Leamer estimated the bursting of the housing bubble could cause the loss of 500,000 construction jobs and 300,000 financial services positions over two to three years, he does not expect a large decline in manufacturing and notes that steady job gains are expected in other industries.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Bottom line: A jobless recovery is going to be followed by a jobful non-recession," Leamer wrote in his U.S. forecast.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate forecast for California, the economists said a recession was not out of the question if the housing market slowed more than expected. It also said that while home-price appreciation was slowing in parts of California, it was a long way from flattening.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- U.S. average home prices jumped 12% from the third quarter of 2004 to the same period in 2005, a historically rapid pace but a slowdown from the previous period as markets in the Pacific states and New England lost momentum, the government said Thursday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight said price appreciation slowed by 2 percentage points from the 14% pace of the second quarter, though home-price gains still advanced faster than consumer inflation, at 4.5%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Arizona led the nation, with average price gains of 30%, followed by Florida at 25%. Michigan had the most subdued gain, 4%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Appreciation rates in the third quarter were extremely strong, although some deceleration can be seen in a number of the faster- appreciating markets," said Patrick Lawler, OFHEO's chief economist.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawler added that most of the recent gains in mortgage interest rates, which are above 6% for 30-year, fixed-rate loans, occurred after the third quarter ended, so their impact will show up in future data.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report is the latest in a series of sometimes conflicting data showing the historically strong housing market softening, but not crumbling, as interest rates rise and prices move out of the range of a number of buyers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales declined in October, while new-home sales reached a record. Overall, mortgage volume is down, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association, though most of the decline is in refinancing and home equity loans.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Realtors and economists have been warning that prices have risen beyond the means of many would-be buyers in some markets.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a conference in Phoenix Thursday, the National Association of Realtors prodded community leaders to increase the supply of affordable housing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The five-year boom has been uneven, with the greatest price gains generally on the East and West coasts. OFHEO said the average home price in Mansfield, Ohio, for instance, rose just 0.8%, the lowest appreciation in the nation. Greeley, Colo.; Lafayette, Ind.; Beaumont, Texas; and Detroit also had among the smallest gains.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phoenix had the fastest price appreciation, 34.4%, followed by Cape Coral/Fort Myers, Fla., 33.2%, and Naples/Marco Island, Fla., 32.4%. Also near the top: Saint George, Utah; Coeur d'Alene, Idaho; Merced, Calif.; and Sarasota, Fla.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some previously hot areas showed slower growth. Nevada's year- over-year appreciation rate dropped by more than 10 percentage points to 17.6%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Idaho, at 15.1%, and Utah, with an annual gain of 11.4%, experienced major jumps.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OFHEO analyzes the mortgage records of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the nation's largest database of conventional, conforming mortgage transactions. The conforming loan limit for 2005 is $359,650, and rises to $417,000 Jan. 1.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Existing home sales declined in October, while inventories and prices jumped, according to a Monday report providing fresh, if mixed, evidence the record housing market is cooling.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said sales of existing single-family homes, co-ops and condominiums declined 2.7% from September to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 7.09 million units.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline would have been larger if not for a spike in sales in such markets as Houston and Baton Rouge that have become magnets for those displaced by recent Gulf Coast hurricanes. Overall, sales were 3.7% above year-ago levels.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory of existing homes for sale jumped 3.5% to 2.87 million. Inventory as a percentage of current sales is now the highest since June 2003. The overall number of units on the market is the largest since April 1986.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising inventories haven't yet crimped prices. The national median price for existing homes sold soared to $218,000, a 16.6% gain from October 2004 -- and the biggest annual jump since 1979.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monday's data are the latest in a string of indicators -- lower mortgage applications, a decline in new home construction and rising interest rates -- signaling a possible turn in the market. Mortgage giant Freddie Mac said the average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 6.07% in October, compared with 5.72% in October 2004.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Housing activity has peaked and is coming down a bit, and we expect further cooling in the coming months. We feel confident that housing is landing softly as rates continue to rise," says David Lereah, the Realtors' chief economist.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists worry conditions are still too hot, saying the rapid price gains raised the odds of corrections in local markets.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The more (homes) appreciate, the more the likelihood that we'll see housing bubbles burst and cause problems for the rest of the economy," says Patrick Newport, U.S. economist for Global Insight.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike Englund of Action Economics points out that home prices usually decline at a 6% rate in the fourth quarter of the year. By contrast, prices rose slightly in October from September.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in inventories is a possible danger sign that the market is out of whack, but Englund says it could also reflect homeowners' confidence they will be able to sell for near the asking price if they list their homes now.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors said existing home sales declined 1.2% in the West in October, with the median price up 16.2% from 2004 to $316,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales in the South dipped 1.8%, with the median price of $196,000, up 18.1% from a year ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Midwest, sales declined 1.9%, while prices rose 10.4% from 2004 to $170,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Northeast home sales declined 7.4%, while the median price rose 10.5% to $252,000.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With houses sitting on the market longer, some agents are hoping to boost traffic, generate more bids and close more deals by listing homes in a price "range" rather than a fixed asking price.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes valued at $500,000, for example, are being listed by agents in a price range of, say, $475,000 to $525,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supporters of this strategy, referred to as value range marketing, say it exposes a property to more buyers by bringing together buyers and sellers who might not have crossed paths had the listing been at a higher fixed price.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's like fishing with a net compared with a single hook," says Carlton Lund, a Carlsbad, Calif., agent who has used range pricing since 1995. A home listed for $339,000 won't turn up in a search by someone who only wants to spend $310,000, Lund says. "But if you price it in a range of $299,000 to $339,000, it will show up in their search," he says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The concept originated in Australia and has been used by some U.S. agents since the mid-'90s. In San Diego County 57% of all closed sales this year used range pricing, up from 10% in 2000. The biggest proponent of range pricing is Prudential Real Estate, which rolled out the strategy nationally in the mid-1990s.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jerry Provansal of Carlsbad, Calif., recently sold a house for $6,000 above the listing range of $725,000 to $775,000 after receiving multiple bids. "We thought everybody would low-ball us, but that didn't happen," he says. "The range enhanced the bidding process."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strategy has failed to achieve mass adoption in the USA due to confusion about how it works and agents' resistance to change, says John Maxfield, president of Prudential Maxfield.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's generating interest now because it works well in slow markets. Ken Truscott of Prudential Truscott Realtors in Duluth, Minn., rolled out the strategy in September amid a 44% rise in listings. He has 25 range listings, which require a seller to consider -- but not accept -- any bid in the range. "The market's soft. There's no reason for buyers to get active," he says, adding that an initial bid "is an incentive to start negotiations."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, a home that sat on the market nearly 50 days at a fixed $139,000 listing price got an offer within a week after it switched to a range of $109,900 to $129,876. After an initial low-ball bid of $109,900 and two counteroffers, it sold for $125,000, Truscott says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Backers say houses sell faster and for more using a range. But a paper published this summer in The Journal of Real Estate Finance and Economics found that homes take longer to sell using a range and that it does not have a significant impact on final prices. "It's a marketing gimmick," says co-author Marcus Allen, a professor at Florida Atlantic University.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But San Diego entrepreneur Steve Cade has sold five homes in 10 years using a range and says it gets buyers and sellers talking. "When people talk, many times they can get a deal done." TEXT OF INFO BOX BEGINS HERE Setting a price 'range' Some real-estate sellers are trying to drive traffic and spur bids by listing homes in a price range. Here's an example of a home that closed in mid- November in Duluth, Minn., using a range-based pricing system.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price range: $109,999-$129,876  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyer's opening bid: $109,999  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seller's 1st counteroffer: $128,000  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyer's 2nd bid: $115,000  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Final sales price: $125,000  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Despite new signs the torrid U.S. housing boom may finally be slowing, economists say it's still too early to tell what effect a weaker housing market will have on the overall economy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. housing starts tumbled in October, while the pricey San Francisco market cooled further, according to Thursday reports.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even a flattening will affect the economy, because the five-year housing boom has made outsized contributions to growth. "We've never had this kind of a run in terms of our role in the economy," says Dave Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders. "Nothing is going to replace it entirely in the overall ... growth rate."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing construction and higher consumer spending fueled by home equity gains have added about 1 percentage point a year to the rate of economic growth, now at a 3.8% annual pace, Seiders says. While he and other economists expect the economy and consumer spending to grow less rapidly in 2006, he doesn't expect the economy to tank.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eugenio Aleman, senior economist at Wells Fargo, says a slowdown will direct money into more profitable, efficient investments.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said housing starts fell 5.6% from September, while permit applications for future building dropped 6.7%, the biggest decline in six years. Still, the permit rate remains high and housing starts have topped a robust 2 million annual pace since the spring.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The word that I'm using to describe it is 'plateauing,'" said Gina Martin, financial economist at Wachovia. "We'll see the housing market slowly start to taper off."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In separate reports, DataQuick Information Systems said home sales in the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area fell on a year-over- year basis in October for the seventh-consecutive month. The median price declined to $614,000 -- down 0.3% from September, but up 17.2% from 2004. And mortgage giant Freddie Mac said the average interest rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage was 6.37% this week, up a percentage point from June.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists expect business spending and stronger commercial construction to pick up some slack. Kenneth Simonson, chief economist for the Associated General Contractors of America, sees encouraging signs, including factory construction and healthier state public works budgets.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm not worried about economic growth tailing off because of housing. There are enough other points of strength," Simonson says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">University of Michigan economists Thursday forecast the economy would expand by 3.4% in 2006 and 2.8% in 2007. Private housing starts will decline from a decades-high 2.06 million units to 1.92 million in 2006 and 1.79 million in 2007. Existing home sales will fall from 6.19 million this year to 5.48 million in 2007.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As signs of a real estate slowdown mount, more agents are having to break the bad news to sellers: Just because your neighbor's house sold for a king's ransom a few months ago, doesn't mean your home will fetch the same princely sum today.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A transition from a seller's to a buyer's market is underway, and agents say they are spending more time trying to get clients to understand the market has changed. They note homes are sitting on the market longer and price gains are slowing as higher interest rates make buyers balk at exorbitant prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many sellers don't want to hear that their windfall might not be as big as they expected. To drive that point home to clients, real estate agents are arming themselves with real-time "market intelligence" -- measures such as days on the market, price per square foot, the gap between sale price and asking price -- that objectively captures the current state of the market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We need to readjust sellers' expectations," says Joseph Pluscht Jr., general manager of residential real estate at Patterson- Schwartz in Wilmington, Del. "But we just don't say we want to reduce the selling price, we tell them, 'Here's why.'"  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With many sellers still in denial about the cooling market, the spread between asking prices and actual selling prices could widen if sellers set prices too aggressively, says Jonathan Miller, president of Miller Samuel, a New York-based home appraisal firm. It will likely take six to nine months before agents get sellers adapted to the new pricing model, Miller says. Until that occurs, sales could stall.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To avoid a precipitous drop in sales and reduce pricing errors, Realtors have embarked on an education campaign:  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Patterson-Schwartz is now running a training course, titled Preparing for a Changing Market. It is designed to provide its 350 agents with help compiling and interpreting key market data that will boost their persuasive powers when approaching clients about the impact of a cooling market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Lyon Real Estate in Sacramento makes available to all of its 950 agents a "Facts and Trends" report filled with key market data, including up-to-the-minute stats on inventory levels and pricing trends, some that examine subdivisions and two-block grids.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sellers have to "get a grip on the market," Michael Lyon says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Roberta Murphy of Windermere Exclusive Properties in Carlsbad, Calif., says she has resorted to "brutal honesty" when discussing what a seller's home is actually worth in "today's" market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And today's market is different than yesterday's. On Tuesday, despite reporting record-setting home sales in the third quarter vs. a year ago, the National Association of Realtors' chief economist, David Lereah, said the quarter likely marked the peak of the five- year housing boom.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Existing home sales set another record in the third quarter of 2005, and prices jumped nearly 15%, but even the National Association of Realtors in its report Tuesday said the housing market will probably begin cooling after its five-year boom.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of single-family homes and condos rose to a 7.24-million annual pace in the July-September quarter, up 6.5% from a year earlier. At the same time, 69 of the 147 metropolitan areas studied had double-digit price gains, as the median price of a single- family home climbed 14.7%, year-over-year, to $215,900. That means half the homes that sold nationwide went for more than that, half for less.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Lereah, the Realtor's chief economist, predicts the heady gains will cool as interest rates rise.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're fairly confident that third-quarter home sales will prove to be the high point of the five-year housing boom," Lereah says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are scattered signs that the housing market has already begun to slow. Interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages are now running about 6.3%, compared with 5.89% in the third quarter. The inventory of new and existing homes on the market is rising.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, DataQuick Information Services released a report Tuesday showing Southern California's housing market remained strong in October. A total of 28,489 homes were sold during the month -- a roughly 10% drop from September, but a 1% gain from a year ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The big question is still whether ... the real estate market will end this cycle with a crash or with a soft landing," says DataQuick President Marshall Prentice, calling the latter outcome more likely.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR said Phoenix had the most robust price gains in the third quarter of 2005: The median home price soared 55.2% to $268,000 from the same period in 2004. In Orlando, home prices rose 44.8% to a median $261,300, while Cape Coral-Fort Myers, Fla., saw a 42.5% price gain to $277,600.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median prices ranged from $72,800 in Danville, Ill., to $721,900 in San Francisco. Elmira, N.Y., and Decatur, Ill., were also among the least expensive markets, while Anaheim, Calif., Honolulu and San Diego ranked with San Francisco as the priciest.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Six areas had small price drops during the period, though the Realtors said the weakness was concentrated in lower-priced cities with large inventories of unsold homes, a weak job market or both.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has been a main economic driver, buoying the job market and boosting consumer spending as owners have extracted hundreds of billions in equity. High Frequency Economics says that even a slowdown to more traditional rates of home construction could shave 2 percentage points off annual economic growth, now running at a 3.8% pace.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Hurricanes, rising interest rates and high energy prices have yet to quash the housing boom.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. housing starts surged in September, while construction permits rose to the highest level since 1973, the Commerce Department said Wednesday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Mortgage Bankers Association said mortgage applications rose more than 6% in the week ended Oct. 14 and were nearly 4% above year-ago levels. The increase came even though the interest rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage rose to 6.09%, up from about 5.5% this summer.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Market mavens can prognosticate on the impending decline of housing all they like," says Jason Schenker, economist for Wachovia. "We have not bought into it."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, despite the upbeat numbers, there were signs Wednesday that the nation's five-year real estate surge might be starting to slow.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve's beige book, an anecdotal look at economic conditions across the country from September through early October, noted housing markets were off their lofty highs in some areas.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In greater Boston, the inventory of unsold houses has jumped significantly. In New Jersey, home builders are no longer raising prices, despite a spike in the cost of materials, according to the Fed.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market expanded in the Chicago, St. Louis and Dallas Fed districts; was strong in San Francisco; good but mixed in Richmond and Minneapolis; and slowing in Kansas City.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Reserve Governor Donald Kohn in a speech in Pittsburgh Wednesday said there were "scattered and mostly anecdotal" signs that the market was cooling.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kohn said a substantial slowing in home price gains seems inevitable and could help the economy, as consumers are not as able to tap rising home equity for extra cash. That could restrain spending and increase savings. "These developments -- housing markets coming off the boil and an accompanying gradual rise in household savings out of current income -- would be favorable for fostering sustainable economic growth," Kohn said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists are increasingly warning that housing markets are out of whack in some expensive areas on the East and West Coasts, raising the specter of a price decline. The California Association of Realtors says only 14% of state households could afford a median- price home of $568,890 in August.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Action Economics notes that economists have predicted a drop in housing activity each of the past three years, even as the sector keeps setting new highs. The firm predicts that the peak of activity will not be seen until early 2006.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts rose 3.4% in September to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.108 million. Permits, an indicator of future strength, rose 2.4% to a 2.189 million pace.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Mortgage rates hit a six-month high Thursday, but economists say they may not rise enough in the near term to make a big dent in home sales.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage giant Freddie Mac said 30-year fixed-rate mortgages had an average rate of 5.98% in the week ended Thursday, the steepest since March, but still historically low.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frank Nothaft, Freddie Mac vice president and chief economist, says rising energy costs and inflation fears will push mortgage rates up gradually. Still, he doesn't expect them to rise much above 6.1% by year's end.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rates at that level will probably not affect the level of home sales. While there is evidence that markets in some expensive cities might be slowing, economists say there's not enough data yet to show the red-hot market has topped.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's too early to come to the conclusion that we've slowed," says Nick Buss, vice president of PNC Real Estate Finance. "Once we get to 6.5% (on interest rates), people will start taking notice. When we get to 7%, we'll really start to see an impact."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The California Association of Realtors said Thursday that only 14% of residents could afford a median-priced home in the state -- the lowest rate since 1989. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said this week signs of housing moderation could be emerging.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing inventories are climbing. Mortgage applications are falling, though purchase loans, which don't include refinancings, are above year-ago levels. New home sales plunged in August.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the National Association of Realtors' pending sales index, based on newly signed contracts, rose 3.2% in August and is 4.7% above a year ago. August existing home sales had the largest price gains in 16 years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard DeKaser, chief economist at National City in Cleveland, says the housing market may have peaked in June, based on the combined sales rate of new and existing homes. Still, he says, more data are needed to tell for sure.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You'll know for a fact (the market has slowed) a year after it occurred," DeKaser says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the reason it's so hard to call a turning point is that housing is a series of local markets. Just as prices have varied from city to city during the price run-up, they are likely to diverge in any slowdown. Manhattan apartment prices dropped 12.7% in the third quarter, according to appraiser Miller Samuel. But Cincinnati home sales are strong. Phoenix has slowed from recent frenetic levels, while northwest Indiana is setting records.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've had a good market this year. ... There's is no bubble here," says Geoffrey Barnes, president of the Cincinnati Area Board of Realtors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anthony Hsieh, president of LendingTree.com, says he doesn't expect interest rates to slow demand for housing until long-term rates top 7%. "I don't see that happening any time soon," he says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bob Walters, chief economist for Quicken Loans, says while rates may dip temporarily, they're unlikely to fall significantly. A more likely scenario is that rates will fluctuate between the "high fives" and 6.3% through the end of the year.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Remember for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee ... or something like that. But according to Robert Toll, the CEO of Toll Bros., one of the nation's home builders, there is no bell tolling for the housing market. Toll says that the housing market will be fine for years to come, despite the concerns of "bubble heads" (like myself) who worry the housing boom is about to bust. Toll says not to worry, at least as far as his company is concerned, because the brothers Toll have so many homes left to build, their closing bell is still many years away.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ron Insana: The housing business looks like a mixed bag lately. How are things at Toll Bros.?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Toll: I think we've got a general slowdown in most of the markets. Now you've got to be careful how you characterize what I said, because when I said that about a month ago, the next day I read analysts' reports that I had said that markets were in the toilet, and I don't mean to imply that at all.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Insana: OK. So which housing fixture do we find ourselves in then?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll: I would say you find yourself in the easy chair back in the den watching football games. What I mean to imply is that it's not the overheated market you had maybe three months ago to a year and a half ago, but that you still have a very good market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I definitely do not see the overheated markets that led to the articles in various publications about the "housing bubble."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Insana: Can you quantify the kind of numbers you're talking about relative to Toll Bros.? Are you anticipating a slowdown in housing starts?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll: You can't have a decline in starts, because our backlogs are so enlarged. If we didn't sell another home for a year, almost, we wouldn't have a drop in starts. And you'll find this is true for the entire industry.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Insana: But can you quantify the expected decline in building activity?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll: I would say something like 10%, but that's a guess.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Insana: And that's orders, not starts, right?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll: Yeah, that's orders. I think you have a slowdown in orders.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Insana: What does that mean to you financially?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll: It means you don't raise the prices as fast as you raised them in the last year and a half, which means you don't make more money than you are currently making. You're still making a bushel full, but the bushel doesn't become a ton.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Insana: What about the impact of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita? Are they pushing up prices of building materials that you need to make houses?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll: No, I don't think so. You've had all commodities increasing fairly rapidly over the past year. I think that has more to do with China buying the commodities than it does with Katrina or Rita. There are shortages that are promoted by the concrete batch manufacturers, but I assure you that shortage goes away if you pay a dollar more a yard. You may have to pay a buck more here or a buck more there, but you'll get all the supplies you want.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Insana: It sounds like you need to pay a buck more per yard as a bribe as opposed to an actual cost of doing business.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll: No, I don't think it's a bribe. It's a clear contract price. With respect to our material supplies, we have long-term contracts for them. The most important commodity is lumber. And we've got our lumber on a long-term contract basis because we operate around lumberyards.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Insana: Alan Greenspan came out this week and said that he still sees some signs of speculation in the housing market. He sees froth. Are there any danger signs that you see in the behavior of home buyers or home speculators, for that matter, in the markets that you serve or anywhere in the country?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll: You know, I would suggest that Alan's just a little behind in observation of the reality of the marketplace. I think he was right when he first spoke about it, which was a couple of months ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think today the froth is off, the speculators are not as numerous and you're getting back to a more normalized market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So I disagree with the characterization by Alan or anybody else that right now, the market is still frothy or even increasing. It's definitely decreasing and appears to have landed softly.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Insana: But are the solid housing fundamentals that everyone's talked about for the last couple of years supportive to housing through 2006?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll: And '07, '08, '09 and '10. Absolutely.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Insana: Why are you confident in your prediction?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll: I don't know how confident I am, but I believe I am right in the prediction because of the demographics.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You take a look at the supply. It's averaged about 1.8 million homes built for 30 years. Look how many more people are here in the last 30 years, 80 million, and yet we're still building the same number of homes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only 30 years ago, you only saw 50,000 second homes being built. Now, you see probably 400,000 or 500,000 second homes being built, which means primary housing being built has gone from (1.75 million) down to about (1.35 million). You're building fewer houses, by a third, than you did 30 years ago, and yet you've got this 80 million increase in population. What's going to give is the price.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Insana: And interest rates are still relatively low. What if they go higher?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll: That's what's supporting the market. As for interest rates, wake me up when the 10-year Treasury is 61/2%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Insana: Is that where you think would be the tipping point for real estate demand?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll: No, that's where I would start to be concerned.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Insana: Because that means an 8% mortgage, right?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll: Right, or 81/2%, which was, by the way, the normal mortgage for the last 25 years. Now for the last couple of years, we've been living in the 51/2% to 61/2% range.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Insana: Because I'm in the business of being skeptical, can you conceive of a scenario where something bad would happen to housing?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll: Sure, on a macro basis. But that's when bad things happen everywhere and, yeah, I can see that. The consumer pulls in his horns because of lost confidence in the government, the administration or Congress.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second, the consumer really pulls in his horns, concerned terribly about loss of jobs as business slows down. On a macro basis, our negative trade balance all of a sudden comes home to roost, and no longer is there a demand for U.S. bonds, in which case interest rates go up tremendously.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And all those macro things I'm worried about, but I can't do anything about them, so I just keep on doing business.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Insana: You haven't mentioned energy prices. That doesn't seem to have an impact on the consumer with respect to housing?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll: It hasn't yet. It's got to (have an impact on) those in the market for starter homes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Major public home building companies really don't do starter housing. They average $250,000, $260,000, and that's certainly not a starter house price. So I would think that gasoline prices should (have an impact on) starter housing first, because as people are on tighter budgets, they have zero elasticity with respect to their ability to save a lot of money on their gas bills.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Insana: What are you telling Wall Street right now about your prospects, not just for the remainder of this year but through 2006?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll: We expect 2005 to be 80% up over '04, and we expect an approximately 20% increase for '06. I think we even went to '07 and said we expected a 20% increase over '06. So that's pretty good moving and grooving.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Insana: Any final thoughts that you think could be important, particularly for people who are more concerned about housing than they are optimistic about it?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toll: The basic prognostication and recommendation is the same as it's been for 200 years, which is if you're thinking of getting a home, the more you delay, the more it will cost you.  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- U.S. existing home sales soared to the second- highest level on record in August, while prices took the biggest annual jump in 26 years, the National Association of Realtors said Monday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said "froth" in home sales may have spilled over into mortgage markets, as borrowers opt for exotic products such as interest-only loans. But he said the vast majority of homeowners, including those in the hottest areas, had sizable equity to weather a possible downturn.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors said sales of existing condos, single-family homes and co-ops rose 2% in August from July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 7.29 million. That's 7.8% above August 2004 and second only to June's 7.35 million pace. Condo sales surged 14.3% from 2004.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price for an existing home was $220,000, up 15.8% from the $190,000 of a year ago and the fastest annual appreciation since July 1979.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group said Hurricane Katrina, which plowed into the Gulf area in late August had no measurable impact on the figures. The effect could be mixed ahead, with disruptions in the disaster area but higher sales in surrounding regions.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market is being supported by 30-year mortgage rates of less than 6%. Economists were surprised by the strength of the report, though several noted the inventory of homes for sale rose to a 4.7- month supply, which could contain prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Clearly, reports of the housing market's demise have been greatly exaggerated," says Stephen Stanley of Greenwich Capital Markets.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales declined 0.4% in the South. On an annual basis, sales were up 7.5% in the South, 8% in the Northeast, 6.5% in the Midwest and 8.3% in the West. Median prices ranged from $322,000 in the West to $176,000 in the Midwest.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greenspan, quoting from a research paper he wrote, his first since 1996, said four-fifths of the recent rise in mortgage debt has come from borrowers extracting home equity. At least half the value of home equity loans and cash-outs has directly or indirectly supported consumer spending.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, less than 5% of homeowners have loan-to-value ratios exceeding 90%, with loan-to-value ratios lowest in states with the hottest markets. That means most homeowners have an equity cushion if prices fall, Greenspan said in a video speech to the American Bankers Association in Palm Desert, Calif. He said it was too early to tell whether the hot market was broadening or cooling.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Business executives who transfer from Killeen, Texas, to La Jolla, Calif., are in for home-price sticker shock: more than $1.7 million worth, according to a survey by Coldwell Banker Real Estate released today.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The realty giant examined the price of a typical middle- management home -- about 2,200 square feet with four bedrooms, a family room, two-and-one-half baths and a two-car garage -- in 344 markets across the USA, Puerto Rico and Canada. The findings are based on sales through July 2005 and an analysis of previous transactions.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The priciest place to relocate was La Jolla, where the type of home targeted by the study averaged $1.875 million. The city has topped the list for three consecutive years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most affordable? Killeen, where a middle-management home averaged $131,328.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, nine of the most expensive markets were in California. Greenwich, Conn., at $1.267 million, was the only non-California locale to make the top 10.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10 most affordable areas included three cities in Texas and two in West Virginia, along with cities in the Dakotas, Montana, Oklahoma and Michigan.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average sales price in the 319 U.S. markets surveyed by the firm was $401,767, a 13.3% increase from 2004.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People want to move where it's warm and where the coasts are," says Jim Gillespie, president and CEO of Coldwell Banker. "As long as more people want to move in than homes are being built, we're going to continue to see an imbalance."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gillespie noted recent surveys, for example, indicating that demand will continue to outpace supply in California. He said buyers need to become more creative as housing becomes less affordable in many markets, using such strategies as longer commutes, looking at condos or buying two-unit dwellings and renting one portion out.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The markets closest to the national average sales price are Minneapolis, at $397,133 and Edina, Minn., at $404,150, the survey found.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fresno, the least expensive market in California, was 3% below the national average price.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other high-price areas outside California include Boston at $1.26 million, Key West, Fla., at $949,375 and Bethesda-Chevy Chase, Md., at $829,750.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan is not included in the survey because of the lack of single-family homes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, in 52% of the U.S. markets surveyed, the typical middle- management home cost less than $300,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most expensive city in Canada was Toronto, with an average sales price of $650,188 in U.S. dollars.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The least expensive Canadian real estate market in the survey was Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, at $117,819. The average price in Puerto Rico was $311,250.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Due to extensive damage to some markets from Hurricane Katrina, this survey did not include Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal antitrust regulators Thursday sued the National Association of Realtors over a policy the government says discriminates against Internet-based brokers at the expense of home buyers and sellers nationwide.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Internet brokers want complete access to all for-sale listings of NAR member brokers. Until now, NAR members could pick and choose which Web-based brokers got those listings and withhold the listings from others. Last May, the Justice Department threatened to sue NAR unless it changed its policy. NAR announced a revised policy early Thursday that gave its members a choice: Either make their listings available to all Internet-only brokers or none at all.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Justice officials say that wasn't enough.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"NAR's policy stifles competition," says Deputy Assistant Attorney General J. Bruce McDonald. "Having access to all listings on all homes for sale is critical," he says, adding that the new NAR policy makes Web-based business models "pretty unattractive."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But NAR general counsel Laurie Janik says "a listing broker has no duty" to give competitors an advantage.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Web-based brokers have complained to Justice officials that the NAR policy prevents them from adequately competing with other  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">brokers if buyers can't see all the homes available in an area. Now even traditional real estate firms are adding "virtual office websites," so they can also interact with customers online and offer discount services. Internet-based brokers typically charge less than the 5% to 6% commissions traditional brokers do.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Butters, a Chicago-based attorney who represents some traditional real estate companies trying to establish online brokerages, says the companies have been "meeting resistance all the way" because of the NAR.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The ability to use this (Internet) technology the way consumers want it to be used is being frustrated," Butters says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NAR's Janik says the Justice Department's lawsuit focuses more on the former policy than its current one. But McDonald says both policies effectively keep listings off Web-only brokers' sites.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Justice says about 200 NAR listing services had adopted the earlier policy and that at least one online real estate broker has shut down because all of the competing brokers withheld their listings.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Says Manuel Iraola, CEO of Florida-based online broker Homekeys, "The listings are a very clear reason why someone would go out of business."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NAR plans to file its response to the Justice lawsuit within weeks.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is ridiculous for USA TODAY to suggest that, for the past several years, home prices have surged "in part because developers, real estate brokers and mortgage lenders have spread the myth that (home prices) have nowhere to go but up." As any college freshman taking Economics 101 this fall would tell you, prices will rise when demand is strong and supply is tight ("Dot-com bust echoes in nation's housing boom," Our view, Real estate prices debate, Aug. 25).  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Allow me to burst your bubble. We enjoy a free market economy in the USA, and the housing marketplace is highly efficient from a pricing perspective precisely because laws of supply and demand rule the day. The United States is in the midst of a 13-year housing boom with home prices rising each year because the fundamentals that support the business are strong, not because a group of industry insiders got together to dupe the home-buying public.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a matter of fact, average home prices in the USA have risen every single year since 1950, even through eight recognized recessions. From 1978 to 1981, mortgage interest rates soared from 9% to more than 18%, and although the volume of homes sold during those years went down, home prices still continued to rise. The reality is that when the housing market cools, people don't sell off their homes in a panic and move into a tent. They just don't move.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is irresponsible journalism to compare today's housing boom with the dot-com bubble. Real estate ownership is a long-term investment secured by a fixed, tangible asset and not a new-economy fabrication being touted by stockbrokers, analysts and investment bankers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stick to reporting the news and stop trying to scare the U.S. public, nearly 70% of whom just happen to be homeowners.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Home prices rose at the fastest pace in a quarter century from the second quarter of 2004 through the second quarter of 2005, the government said Thursday. Economists warned that the bull market in housing isn't sustainable, but isn't over yet.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Office of Federal Housing and Enterprise Oversight said prices rose 13.4% in the 12 months ended in June, the fastest rate since 1979. Appreciation was 3.2% from April to June 2005, 12.8% on an annual basis. Prices have risen more than 53% in the past five years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevada led the nation for the year, at 28.1% growth. But Las Vegas, for the first time since late 2003, was not on the list of the 20 hottest cities for the quarter. Prices zoomed in Arizona, rising 9.7% in the second quarter -- the most rapid pace of any state.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is no evidence here of prices topping out," said OFHEO chief economist Patrick Lawler. "Some areas that have experienced relatively slow appreciation are picking up steam."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing market has been setting records for most of the past five years, with prices rising far faster than inflation and incomes. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has warned that some overheated markets are ripe for a fall.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were some tentative signs that the housing market was starting to peak in late summer, after the OFHEO survey period. Existing home sales declined 2.6% in July from the previous month, though new home sales surged to a record.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage giant Freddie Mac said the interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 5.71% in the week ended Thursday, down from 5.77% the previous week. Mortgage rates are lower than a year ago, even though the Fed has been raising short-term rates.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest rates on 10-year notes, falling before Katrina rolled through, dropped on concerns about the storm's impact on the economy. Ten-year note yields ended at 4.03% Thursday, from 4.16% a week ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's not sustainable forever ... but with rates coming down, it's stretching out the peak," says David Lereah, National Association of Realtors' economist.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dave Seiders, chief economist of the National Association of Home Builders, also calls the price increases unsustainable and predicts they would start "quietly winding down."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The OFHEO said 30 of the 265 cities surveyed had four-quarter price growth of 25% or higher. Twenty-five states had double-digit growth, and eight saw prices climb more than 20%.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today's debate: Real estate prices Our view: Hot prices need to cool before they bring down the nation's economy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">***  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some parts of the country, it's hard to talk to a neighbor without the conversation turning to real estate prices -- the house down the street that's on the market for twice what it went for in 2001, the friend who has made a fortune on the side buying and selling properties.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sound familiar? A few years ago, the friend getting rich might have been a day trader rather than a condo flipper. And the surging prices were not in real estate but in stocks.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Internet stock bubble ended badly. The same could happen, in slower motion, with housing prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A cooling of the real estate market is both desirable and essential, not only to make housing more affordable, but also to decrease the risk of a sudden downturn in the economy caused by a housing bust.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the past several years, home prices have surged in select regions of the country, in part because developers, real estate brokers and mortgage lenders have spread the myth that they have nowhere to go but up. Small investors have put their money into real estate. Institutional investors have done the same, pouring cash into portfolios of loans, known as mortgage-backed securities. That has kept interest rates low and prompted banks to make riskier, more exotic loans.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some cities, real estate costs have surged well beyond growth in salaries. The National Association of Realtors reported Tuesday that the median price of existing homes in the USA surged more than 14% -- to $218,000 -- in the year ending July 31.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the bubbles are concentrated in certain areas, they are tied to the health of the overall economy in several ways:  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Surging borrowing. Housing-related debt has swelled from $4.8 trillion in 2000 to $8 trillion today, as buyers have struggled to get into pricey markets. That puts consumer spending at risk if interest rates rise.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unbalanced economy. Almost 56% of all new non-farm jobs created since the end of the recession in 2002 were in housing-related areas such as construction, finance and home furnishing, according to a study by Wells Fargo. If job growth is concentrated in one sector of the economy, it creates the risk of a sudden downturn if that sector falters.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">False sense of affluence. Many economists see the same kind of "wealth effect" today with real estate that they saw with stocks in the 1990s. As homeowners' investments rise in value, they feel richer and are more likely to spend, often tapping into their equity. This behavior could reverse abruptly if prices retreat.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who profess to be unconcerned argue that today's sky-high prices are brought about by heavy demand and short supplies. They are correct -- to a point. In places like the San Francisco Bay area, natural barriers and restrictive land-use polices make it difficult to build housing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, their argument ignores the increasingly global nature of the real estate industry. Today's prices are sustained by investors worldwide buying everything from mortgage-backed securities to Treasury bonds. If they get skittish about Americans' borrowing, they could pull their money out of U.S. debt markets, sending interest rates up and property values down. All of which is good reason for the Federal Reserve's steady push to nudge interest rates higher.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing boom has helped the economy. But if it doesn't take a rest, it will not only be a topic of casual conversation but also a matter of considerable concern.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said Wednesday that new home sales surged to a record in July, fanning the debate about whether the torrid housing market is an investment bubble poised to pop.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home sales in July grew 6.5% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.41 million from 1.32 million in June, the government reported.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government data contrast with numbers released Tuesday by the National Association of Realtors, which showed a slowdown in the market for existing homes. The trade group said July sales of homes fell 2.6% to an annualized rate of 7.16 million from June.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists at UBS Securities warned Wednesday that the data on housing sales and prices are volatile and tricky to read at this point.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't think housing is shooting up anymore, but nor is it plunging," says James O'Sullivan, a UBS economist. "There is some evidence that housing is peaking or edging down, although there's no real significant weakness yet" in the economic data.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The UBS economists wrote that declines in home sales and prices "are likely to be modest" -- unless mortgage rates rise enough to slow home-buying.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pa., says it's troublesome that home sales are booming the most in the West and Northeast.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That's where the insanity in prices is now," Naroff says. "We may be in a panic mode. People are getting in as quickly as they can in order not to get priced out of the market, and that is not sustainable."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department reported Wednesday that new home sales in July soared 36% in the West and 10% in the Northeast -- but swooned 14% in the Midwest and 4% in the South.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Naroff cautioned that speculation is rampant, although there's no solid economic data on how many home buyers are "flipping," or selling, their houses shortly after buying them.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, Naroff says, office workers who can't afford pricey real estate purchases have been telling him about their investment plans for flipping condos.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That reminds him of the apocryphal Wall Street tales that it's time to dump your stocks when shoeshine men and taxi drivers tell you where to invest.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Yes, a lot of people have made money off the housing market, but logic says the market has to turn," Naroff says. "You know we're headed for potential calamity."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet another potential warning sign: The Commerce Department said that the number of new homes for sale rose to a four-month supply. Naroff believes a glut of unsold homes could lead to a housing bust.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also Wednesday, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported that its measure of mortgage applications dipped 0.7% from the previous week.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the broader economic front, the Commerce Department said Wednesday that new U.S. factory orders for durable goods, or big- ticket items, tumbled 4.9% in July from June.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today's debate: Real prices Opposing view: Strong economy, short supply and high demand equal low risks.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">***  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's big box office this summer in the national media, but paraphrasing Mark Twain, reports of an impending housing price collapse are greatly exaggerated.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demographic and economic fundamentals support today's housing expansion.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To begin with, strong household formations, fueled by population growth and immigration, are pushing average annual demand for new housing into the 2 million-unit range for the decade ahead, about today's production level. Equally important, the U.S. economy is fueling enough new jobs and income gains to support brisk housing demand even as interest rates inch upward.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second, the unusually steep price gains provoking much of the speculation over a housing bubble are mainly in California, Nevada, Florida and the Northeast corridor, and aren't the norm for most local markets.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Third, builders are running into serious obstacles, such as excessive growth controls or moratoria, in lining up land for development in the fastest growing housing markets. In the face of unrelenting housing demand, this is making housing shortages even worse, increasing the cost of building and persistently increasing house prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fourth, unlike trading in stocks and bonds, buying a home is a costly and time-consuming process that is not susceptible to the kind of run on the market that occurred in the dot.com collapse. Also, the vast majority of families live in the homes they buy for a long time and don't flip them for a profit after a few months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, history shows that most unsustainable house price booms end quietly, as house price appreciation slows while ongoing increases in household income and housing supply help restore balance to local markets. A recent Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. study shows that house price booms lead to price busts only when local economies stumble for other reasons, such as a national recession. With the U.S. economy in the midst of a strong expansion, those risks are quite low for the foreseeable future.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It doesn't take a Ph.D. in economics to conclude that short supply and high demand do not add up to a housing bubble.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">***  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing market remains strong but is chilling a bit, with the annual rate of July home sales falling 2.6% from June, the National Association of Realtors said Tuesday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the NAR and the Mortgage Bankers Association -- two leading industry trade groups -- joined Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and others in adopting a more cautious view of the high-priced housing market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">July's home sales, which fell to a 7.16 million annual rate from a 7.35 million rate in June, still was the third-highest in NAR records.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But prices keep rising. The median price of single-family homes and condominiums jumped 14% from a year ago to a record high of $218,000, the NAR said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The markets still are very healthy and the fundamentals are still there," says David Lereah, NAR's chief economist. "But there certainly has been a slowing in the housing market, like air coming out of a balloon."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the Fed keeps increasing interest rates, Lereah predicts "a soft landing" for housing, with home sales and prices slowing to single-digit growth rates.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another sign that the market might be cooling, the inventory of houses for sale rose 2.6% in July to 2.75 million homes -- a nearly five-month supply, the NAR says. Despite record sales, the inventory of homes has soared 12.6% this year, says Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pa. "With so many homes on the market," he said in a statement Tuesday, "the risk of a meltdown if mortgage rates jump is increasingly sharp."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year, Greenspan warned that home prices are "unsustainable" and there's speculative "froth" in some local real estate markets.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists predict that the housing market is an investment bubble ready to burst. If that happens, it could dampen consumer spending and shrink the economic growth rate by 1 to 2 percentage points.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trade groups for the Realtors and mortgage bankers are warning consumers to think carefully before leaping into potentially risky home financing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has rocketed since the late 1990s because of job growth, rising household income and mortgage rates below 6%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But economists and bankers are getting nervous about the wide use of higher-risk financing, such as interest-only mortgages, adjustable-rate mortgages and so-called subprime mortgages for low- income home buyers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR recently issued a warning about the use of what it calls "specialty mortgages." On its website, the group advises home buyers to "do your homework first" to avoid payment shock or seeing their mortgage payments suddenly leap as interest rates rise.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Easy financing helps people buy homes, but also raises foreclosure risks, says chief economist Doug Duncan of the Mortgage Bankers Association.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Duncan and the mortgage bankers' group, which released a housing report Tuesday, predict that housing sales and prices next year will slow to single-digit growth rates. Growth in the economy, household incomes and business investments should offset the risks of a housing meltdown, Duncan says. U.S. home prices have fallen only in three or four quarters since World War II, he says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, the Commerce Department is expected to release new-home sales figures for July.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Existing-home sales soared to new heights in the second quarter of 2005, with prices up 13.6% and volume setting a record, the National Association of Realtors said Monday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sixty-seven of the 149 metropolitan areas surveyed by the NAR posted double-digit increases in median home prices from the second quarter of 2004 to the second quarter of 2005. An additional seven had what NAR called "generally modest" price declines -- though none of those were areas that had experienced fast price buildup.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median existing-home price was $208,500 in the second quarter, up 13.6% from 2004. The Phoenix area had the biggest price gains, up 47% from the second quarter of 2004 to $243,400.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Volume was up 4.6% from the previous high of 6.9 million units on a seasonally adjusted annual basis in the second quarter of 2004.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">West Virginia saw the biggest surge in existing-home sales, up 21.7%. Washington and Vermont both saw gains of nearly 20%. Five states and the District of Columbia had declines.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has been setting records since the late 1990s. Price and volume gains in some cities, particularly on the East and West coasts, have been so large that many economists, including Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, warn they may be due for price declines.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are signs of recent cooling in some areas, including slower price gains in California and some other hot markets, a falloff in mortgage refinance applications and a decline in a National Association of Home Builders confidence survey. But analysts are mixed on whether the overall housing market has topped out.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you had talked to me a week ago, I would have said, 'Yes, this is the peak and now things are slowing down.' But now mortgage rates have come down," says David Lereah, chief economist for NAR.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Demand is not slowing down. It's just going to another location," Lereah adds, saying as some hot markets see slower sales or price gains, others post big increases. Las Vegas had 52% year- over-year price gains in the second quarter of 2004. This year, prices rose a more modest 11.2%, but the Reno market jumped 32%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Florida, as Palm Beach prices rise more slowly, Palm Bay and Fort Myers are heating up, Lereah says. Prices in Phoenix are soaring, even as price increases in Los Angeles, Orange County and San Diego slow.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Cumberland, Md., about 140 miles northwest of Washington, prices were up 18.6% from April through June from the same period in 2004. Liz Skidmore, broker owner of Robison &amp; Skidmore Professional Real Estate Services, which serves the area, says more than 50% of recent buyers are from out of the area, including retirees and telecommuters affected by rising prices elsewhere.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our average sales price hovers right around $100,000. Any other county in the state, it's two-hundred-plus ... a lot of people are realizing what a hidden treasure this is," Skidmore says, calling multiple offers common on local sales.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NAR said median prices ranged from a low of $73,400 in Danville, Ill., to a high of $726,900 in the San Francisco area.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There have been some signs that the market slowed in July and August, after the survey period.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The South, particularly Texas, slowed earlier this year, but I think pricing is coming back in those markets," says John Burns, founder of John Burns Real Estate Consulting. He is concerned about a slowdown in San Diego but adds the market has probably gone from an A-plus to a B. Another sign of possible stress: a falling number of first-time buyers in California.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report Monday, real estate firm DataQuick Information Systems said Southern California's home prices hit a record -- the sixth in a row -- in July, though volume declined. The median price was $469,000, up 0.9% from June and 16.7% from July 2004.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marshall Prentice, DataQuick president, said he saw no signs of a "bursting bubble," just the ebb and flow of a real estate cycle.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Though homeownership is at a record level, affordability is a growing problem.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices rose 78% from 1994 to 2004, not adjusted for inflation, while personal incomes rose 64%, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond's Region Focus magazine. The number of middle-income families spending more than 30% of their income on housing -- a benchmark of affordability -- rose from 3.2million in 1997 to 4.5million in 2001.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The market isn't going to self-correct," says Nicholas Retsinas, director of Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies. "We are not going to return to a day where the housing market is in synch with our labor market and issues of affordability are restricted to the very poor."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Non-profit housing groups say that makes it even more important that manufactured housing become a viable, appreciating asset. One big hurdle? Financing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though nearly all manufactured homes are never moved once delivered to a lot, many states consider them personal property, like cars. More than 60% of manufactured homes were titled as personal property in 2003, forcing buyers to turn to higher- interest loans that lack the consumer protections of mortgages.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pricing is not transparent. The Southwest regional office of the Consumers Union found prices for the same model of manufactured home fluctuated widely, with first-time home buyers paying 8% more on average than more experienced buyers. Those financing through dealers paid 11% more than those using outside lenders or cash.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2003, Fannie Mae tightened standards for buying manufactured housing loans. Chuck Rumfola, Fannie Mae vice president for manufactured housing, says loan-to-value ratios have since gone down, credit scores moved up and loans have shifted to 20-year terms from 30 years, helping borrowers build equity faster.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Manufactured Housing Institute has also developed best- lending practices, including employee training, underwriting standards and consumer protections.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If it's done right, it has a lot of potential. The problem has been that it hasn't been done right," Rumfola says.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Amid the high-priced real estate here, generations of young families have hunted for homes in a creek-side neighborhood called Friendly Woods, one of Silicon Valley's early housing tracts.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bob and Mary Jo Maytum are 78-year-old retirees originally from Ohio and Kentucky. As a mid-30s couple dreaming of a new start in California, they moved to Friendly Woods when the defense and high- tech industries were lifting off. After buying their ranch house in 1963 for $17,600, they raised two kids.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Yup, we're original settlers," says Bob Maytum, a lanky, heavy- smoking veteran of World War II.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Down the street, Bimba Rao and Abhijit Kakhandiki are high-tech professionals in their early 30s with doctorates from Duke and Stanford. Born in India, they settled in Silicon Valley in the 1990s as the Internet exploded. Recently, they beat 25 other bidders to buy their ranch home for $880,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Yes, it's a struggle, but we like the Bay Area," says Kakhandiki, a senior consultant at Agile Software.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tale of the two families shows how the white-hot real estate market has evolved since the 1960s -- and how little the American dream of homeownership has changed. A house may be the costliest investment most people make, yet its value also lies in family, neighborhood and community.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Silicon Valley and Friendly Woods -- a middle-class neighborhood of 100 plain homes in the classic suburban ranch style -- reflect economic and cultural changes that swept the USA in the past half- century.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the U.S. and Silicon Valley economies have morphed from the defense and smokestack industries into the sleek technology and business service sectors. A mostly white workforce is turning into a more global, ethnically diverse one. And, like hot markets nationwide, those old houses in the Friendly Woods ZIP code have rocketed in price, selling from $700,000 to $1.5 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 1950s, Silicon Valley was a mainly rural region of farms and fruit orchards. But military contractors, scientists and computer engineers turned the Valley into a high-tech mecca. Lockheed, Varian Associates, Hewlett-Packard and other old-guard companies ruled the business landscape for decades.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, the defense industry here has waned, and the business pioneers have died or retired. The Internet has spawned thousands of e-commerce start-ups, from eBay to Yahoo. The international economy has led to waves of high-tech professionals immigrating here.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Friendly Woods, most new-home buyers were born in Taiwan, China and India. Neighbors "keep up with the Singhs," not the Joneses. Girls in the local Brownies troops speak Mandarin and Hindi. "Cricket moms" in minivans drive their kids in neat white uniforms to play cricket in the park.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The vast economic and cultural changes come as the U.S. real estate market continues to boom, hitting record sales prices in recent months. In California, the median price of a single-family home last month rose 16% to $542,720 from June 2004, the California Association of Realtors reports.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As prices rise, economists and real estate professionals debate whether homes in sizzling markets -- from Boston to Los Angeles -- are dangerously overpriced.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has warned of speculation in some markets, while others fear that drops in home sales and prices could dampen consumer spending and hurt the economy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the pride and pitfalls of homeownership are never- ending conversation topics at backyard barbecues here.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Bay Area has always been a highly desirable area for professionals and Asian immigrants for 20, 25 years," says John Karevoll of DataQuick Information Systems, a real estate research firm in San Diego. "People there seem more willing to pay more for houses than buyers anywhere else in the state."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Midwest migrant  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A youthful Bob Maytum never imagined he'd buy a home in California. After serving in World War II as a Navy machinist on an aircraft carrier in the South Pacific he returned to his hometown of Cincinnati.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soon he had a blind date with a polite department store model named Mary Jo. She thought he looked "like a string bean" but went out with him anyway. They danced to big-band music and watched Mickey Rooney movies. They married a year later.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A federal G.I. loan at 4% interest financed their first house, an $11,000, two-bedroom home in Cincinnati. They sold it in 1958 and bought a three-bedroom, red-brick home in Golf Manor, a prized development outside Cincinnati.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That was our dream house," says Mary Jo. "It had everything we wanted."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But five years later, Bob lost his production manager's job and got an offer from American Standard in San Leandro, Calif. The Maytums sold their house for $20,000, loaded their Dodge sedan and headed West.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They settled during the early 1960s in a sun-baked region 40 to 50 miles south of San Francisco that would be dubbed Silicon Valley. Lockheed, the maker of the Polaris missile, would become the region's largest Cold War era employer. The U.S. government and the Stanford Research Institute would build a computer communication system later known as the Internet.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The suburbs here also rose quickly, typified by the single- story, L-shaped ranch homes common across the country. The Maytums looked at many properties, finally buying a cozy corner house in Friendly Woods, a neighborhood of towering oaks and pines and a tadpole-filled stream called Calabazas Creek.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They got a steal at today's prices. Their $17,600 house would have cost $112,000 in 2005 dollars.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three-bedroom, two-bath home had drapes, carpet, landscaping. Farmers sold strawberries from roadside stands, and the Maytums could see the grade school from their kitchen window.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It reminded us of back home," Mary Jo says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the next three decades, the Maytums hosted huge block parties and barbecues that filled the street. Their kids and grandkids played kickball, hide-and-seek and Red Rover, Red Rover. Bob volunteered so often at the Meyerholz elementary school that he became known to three generations of school kids as Mr. Bob, and the school would honor him with a special day.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, he has heart problems and has had bypass surgery and other medical procedures. But the Maytums still relax on their plant- filled front porch, sipping coffee and waving to everyone.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many new neighbors are Chinese-Americans and Indo-Americans. Since the 1980s, Friendly Woods and the adjacent city of Cupertino, home of Apple Computer, have become so popular with Asian immigrants and their families and friends that they make up nearly 50% of the residents.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asian dim sum restaurants, supermarkets and medical offices have risen where ranches stood decades ago. Several Chinese-Americans have been elected to public office in Cupertino, and the Cupertino Union School District, one of the top-ranked districts in California, offers a Chinese-language immersion program for grade- school students.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Maytums' grown daughter, Sandy Chase, recalls as a kid returning soft-drink bottles to the local All-American Market, only to see it suddenly replaced by the Tin Tin Oriental Market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was a whole new world, walking into that store," she says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, the Maytums say, the neighborhood has changed. It's still quiet and "has nice people." But there are a lot fewer kids running around, and the last block party they hosted was six years ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sure, the Maytums have thought about selling their house. Think of the dream vacations they could take, they say. But they're happy now, and it would be hard to leave four decades of memories.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What more could you ask for?" Bob says. Adds Mary Jo: "We plan on staying a long, long time."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asian newcomers  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year, so many people flocked to the open house for the Friendly Woods ranch home that Rao and Kakhandiki had to park far down the street.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house was old and small and needed work. But they liked the neighborhood and the home's potential. The listed price was $750,000, so they offered $880,000. Soon they had second thoughts about the bidding frenzy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was an eBay mentality," says Kakhandiki, relaxing in his living room one night. "We thought, 'Are we crazy? What are we doing?'"  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rao and Kakhandiki immigrated to the USA in the early 1990s to study electrical engineering and civil engineering. After graduating, the two got married in India, then returned to Silicon Valley and rented a tiny apartment.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2000, they pooled their savings and bought a three-bedroom home for $435,000 in nearby Sunnyvale. They fixed it up with landscaping, a new fence and a remodeled kitchen.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as their two babies grew, Rao, a systems engineer at Siemens, and Kakhandiki decided to hunt for a larger home in a better school district.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The homes in upper-middle-class Palo Alto and Los Altos were too expensive.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Nothing was for sale under $1million!" Kakhandiki says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They found slightly cheaper houses in Cupertino and plunged into the bidding wars.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Friendly Woods, a block over the Cupertino border, they spotted a three-bedroom, two-bathroom house on a shaded corner. At 1,150 square feet, it was smaller than their Sunnyvale home.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it had a large front yard, with parks and a public library nearby. The commute to work was not bad. The grade school was a short walk away, and the neighborhood feeds well-regarded Lynbrook High School.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A month earlier, the couple had barely missed making the top bid on a nearby house, so this time they weren't taking chances.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They told their real estate agent to offer $880,000 with no contingencies. They also wrote a letter to the longtime owner, introducing themselves and explaining why they liked the house. It worked. They beat out the 25 other bidders.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I was thrilled," Kakhandiki says. "I also thought, 'Wow, this means a higher loan.'"  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To buy the house, they took out a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage for more than $600,000. While they make good money, the new home stretched their finances: Their mortgage payment doubled to well over $4,000 a month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, like many new Silicon Valley homeowners, Kakhandiki and Rao feel good about their investment. Why? Because home prices in the San Francisco Bay Area have held at 30% higher than the rest of California over the past 20 to 25 years, says DataQuick's Karevoll.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Karevoll and other real estate professionals say there's no bubble in Silicon Valley. The high-tech economy remains strong. High- income couples keep driving up demand for housing. And interest rates still are below 6%, which keeps down mortgage payments.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A bubble is when prices inflate and there's a price correction of 20%," says Richard Calhoun, head of Creekside Realty in Silicon Valley and publisher of the Bay Area Real Estate Market Newsletter. "I don't believe that's going to happen. The market is a very good self-regulator where supply-and-demand rule."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One healthy sign: Friendly Woods and nearby neighborhoods are enjoying "a steady, balanced market now" among buyers and sellers, says Dave Meunier, a real estate agent at Coldwell Banker in Cupertino.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The area has 13 homes offered recently for sale and 14 "pending sales." In pending sales, contracts have been signed, but escrow hasn't closed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor is demand weakening from Asian immigrants, Meunier says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People used to move within a 50-mile radius," he says. "Now folks from around the world want to be here, and they want to live in the same neighborhood."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The neighbors may have changed, but Mary Jo Maytum's hospitality hasn't.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, she welcomed a new Asian family to Friendly Woods with a pitcher of ice-cold lemonade. They never waved to her before, she says, smiling, but now they do.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction ran 7/28/2005: A map of housing prices Wednesday should have located San Jose, Calif., in the San Francisco Bay area.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sharply rising home prices are making a risky housing market even riskier. Six hot markets now face a greater than 50% chance of price declines the next two years, says a study to be released today by PMI Mortgage Insurance.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rapid price escalation has outpaced income gains and rent increases, making homes less affordable and increasing the odds of a price correction, PMI found.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Key findings on the likely direction of home prices the next two years:  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*The risk of price declines -- based on an analysis of prices, employment conditions and affordability -- has increased in 36 of the nation's 50 largest housing markets since PMI's last study, released in the spring.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*The number of markets with a 50%-plus chance of a price drop has jumped from two to six.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*There is a 21.3% chance of a nationwide house-price drop, up from 20.2%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*The highest-risk sites remain in coastal areas, with the biggest odds of falling prices in Boston (55.3% ) and Long Island (Nassau- Suffolk), N.Y. (54.0%). Six of the 10 highest-risk areas are in California.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*The risks are also rising in the suburbs of hot coastal cities, as well as non-coastal markets.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Certain markets ... are getting riskier," says Mark Milner, PMI's chief risk officer. "Prices can't keep going up at the current rates of appreciation. It doesn't have to end badly, but it is pretty clear there will be a flattening out."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Milner points out that even in high-risk Boston, there is a roughly 45% chance prices won't fall. Least-risky city: Pittsburgh (5.6% chance of a price drop).  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The "summer" study, the latest quarterly installment of the PMI U.S. Market Risk Index, is another piece of evidence suggesting the housing boom might be in danger of cooling and causing financial pain for homeowners who overpaid or took on too much debt.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monday, the National Association of Realtors said home prices in June rose at the fastest annual pace in 25 years, with the median home rising 14.7%, to $219,000. The sharp rise prompted NAR chief economist and self-described real estate bull David Lereah to warn that prices are getting ahead of themselves in some markets. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned last week of speculative fervor in some markets and said price declines are possible.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PMI economist Marco Van Akkeren says the use of exotic mortgages, such as interest-only loans and those that allow borrowers to pay lower monthly payments for an initial period, is creating greater risks for buyers and inadvertently pushing prices even higher. If interest rates rise, "Affordability is going to be much more of an issue," he says.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Existing-home sales roared to another record in June, with prices posting the biggest yearly increase since 1980, the National Association of Realtors said Monday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a report that offered few signs the hot housing market is slowing, the Realtors said sales of existing single-family homes, condos and town houses, fueled by low mortgage rates and a good economy, rose 2.7% in June to a seasonally adjusted 7.33 million, up from 7.14 million in May. Sales were 4.4% above year-ago levels.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price for all types of existing homes rose to $219,000, a 14.7% increase from June 2004. That's the fastest pace of year-over-year price appreciation since November 1980, when prices spiked 15.6%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm one of the most bullish people in real estate ... (and) I am worried that prices are getting ahead of themselves now in certain local markets," said David Lereah, the association's chief economist.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lereah said some especially hot markets were being driven by tight inventory and low interest rates.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he said the increasing use of interest-only and other types of payment-reducing loans in California, Massachusetts, Miami and other areas is worrisome. "We need to have some air come out of some of these balloons, and these interest-only loans are not helping; they are aggravating the situation," Lereah said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The higher-than-expected sales data bolstered forecasts for healthy economic growth in the second quarter of the year. At the same time, some economists said the report added to concerns that the housing market is overheated.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an advisory to its clients, forecasting firm Economy.com said that while a national correction in the housing market is not likely, prices are out of line with fundamentals in several cities. "A more pronounced correction is likely for these metro areas, particularly if prices continue to escalate," it said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said last week that there are increasing signs of market speculation and worrisome use of exotic mortgages. He added that lower prices were possible in some areas. A housing slowdown could hurt not only individual buyers, but the overall economy as well. That's because the huge rise in home equity in the past several years propelled consumer spending.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard DeKaser, chief economist for National City in Cleveland, said though Monday's report didn't show it, there are some indications the market could be starting to cool. For instance, new- home prices have been rising less rapidly in recent months. He said the next several months should tell whether the market is at a turning point.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage interest rates have ticked higher, though 30-year fixed mortgages remain below 6%. The number of existing homes on the market in June was the highest in the past 12 months, but not high enough to put a dent in prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales were strong across the country, rising 5.5% in the West, 1.1% in the South, 1.9% in the Midwest and 3.4% in the Northeast.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost as dumbfounding as the feverish U.S. real estate market are the feverish conversations about the market at dinner and cocktail parties or wherever homeowners gather. Does anybody talk about anything else?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apparently not, and never mind that there's a war on, a Supreme Court battle looms, Social Security is insecure and, oh, yeah, Tom Cruise is jumping on couches and dissing psychiatry.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of that is as compelling as boasting about our real estate triumphs. Even if they're only on paper. Even if we had virtually no hand in achieving the triumph. Even if all we did was buy a house and watch as it magically rose in value.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No matter: We have bragging rights, and we are exercising them to a fare-thee-well.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is the No. 1 topic of conversation everywhere you go across the country," says Steven Gaines, author of The Sky's the Limit: Passion and Property in Manhattan, a new book about the most real- estate-obsessed city in the country. "Ten years, ago people talked about their plastic surgery or the stock market. But now they're entranced by real estate. And size does matter."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So here we are at the dinner table, in the coffee shop, at the office, at the ballgame, chattering about how much our houses are worth and how much money we've made, and did you see what so-and-so made on his house?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a national market in which half-million-dollar starter homes and $1 million trailers aren't unheard of, no wonder scores of real estate-related shows are on television. One of the latest, TLC's Property Ladder, is about people who buy, renovate and "flip" for big profits. Sharon Jackson, who owns a home in a historic district in San Marco, Fla., near Jacksonville, says she has seen most of these shows.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"On one show I saw they had two Texas moms flipping, and one's sole intention was to make enough money to buy breast implants," Jackson says with a laugh. Talk about rude: She says people in her area are so caught up in the fever that they interrupt business meetings to make frantic cellphone calls to nail down not-yet-built properties before rates go up.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blame the go-go '80s, when people began talking openly about their stocks, 401(k)s and net worth, says Jerry Howard, National Association of Home Builders CEO. "Now people talk about how much their houses have appreciated so they don't have to talk about the Michael Jackson trial or the war or Katie Couric's new haircut." (Not to mention the sad state of their portfolios these days.)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The matter of manners  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, isn't this all kind of tacky? What would Emily Post think?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not much, says Peggy Post, her great-granddaughter-in-law, etiquette author and spokeswoman for the Emily Post Institute. Real estate braggadocio may be a natural phenomenon now that everyone's doing it, but it can still cross the line into the rude, offensive, even mean territory that Emily used to warn against.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're like little kids in a candy shop, telling anyone who will listen, and it can be a real turn-off," Post says. "It's a self- centered thing, talking about me, me, me, making the other person feel really crummy, or 'I really blew it.'"  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christine Laurence, 26, a renter in Washington, D.C., often feels crummy about -- or bored by -- the non-stop talk of real estate.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Most of my conversations revolve around how my friends and I will never be able to afford to own," she says. "I have friends with places that doubled or tripled in value. There's a little bit of jealousy they got in when they did, and I didn't." Meanwhile, she's "throwing away" thousands in rent each month. "It's sort of dismaying."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost as dismaying, some would say, as the abandonment of good manners. Others, such as Adorna Carroll, a top broker in central Connecticut, say this generation of Americans is simply more comfortable sharing personal information with friends.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Everybody wants to share their great and bad experiences with their social circle, because everyone knows someone who is either buying or selling," Carroll says. Besides, she says, it's way more impolite to get into political arguments in social situations. "Real estate is conversation-neutral."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, if it was once considered impolite in American society to blab how much one's house is worth, it's no longer the case. "In France, if you brought up money at the dinner table, you would be considered gauche and people would not speak to you," Gaines says. "Here, people absolutely worship money, especially when talking about their houses and all the delicious details that go with it."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Etiquette expert Charles Purdy, who writes his "Social Grace" column online and for the San Francisco Weekly, says talking about one's money in public is still improper. "However, fewer and fewer people are aware of this," he sighs. Yes, it is possible to discuss these matters among close friends and associates, but you run the risk of looking like a social clod by bringing it up when strangers are in the mix, he says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Being an American means we don't have social classes, and we don't judge people by income. Everyone knows this mostly isn't true, but we are required by good manners to at least pretend that we don't.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"So when we start bragging about money or, worse, asking people about their money, we've broken the social contract."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if everybody's doing it? No excuse, he says. "Everyone feels sick in the stomach at some time, but we don't talk about it at the dinner table."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if people are just trying to get information or trying to be helpful? "Consult a newspaper or a professional real estate broker."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices get people excited  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But maybe the reason we've all lost our heads is because there's such a forehead-smacking quality to the real estate market virtually throughout the country.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors, which tracks median home prices in 136 metropolitan areas, found double-digit increases in sales prices in a record 66 areas and only six that posted price declines in the first quarter of 2005 compared with the first quarter of 2004. The national median price for an existing single- family home was $188,800, up 9.7%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And despite Florida being the nation's capital of humidity and hurricanes, the market is just nuts. Nine of the top 15 metro areas with the largest increases were in Florida; Bradenton, on the central Gulf Coast south of St. Petersburg, posted a 45.6% increase.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We talk about it almost every day," says Kim Warnke, a telephone customer service worker who lives in Coral Springs, Fla. "OK, yesterday we did talk about Brad and Angelina for 10 minutes."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But eventually, all talk returns to real estate. People who brag "are insecure and have no class," but Warnke says they can't help themselves. The conversation always goes along the lines of "'We bought the house for $340,000, and now we're selling for $600,000,'" she says. "It's insane."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New York pulse  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking of insanity, take New York. Real estate is a competitive sport, and the Olympics are every night at parties and social events. "Rich New Yorkers like to drive each other crazy. They really like to compete," says journalist Holly Peterson, a self- described "anthropologist" of the Upper East Side who is working on a novel about the have-more crowd's obsessions.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They don't have cars so they can't show off their Ferrari, and they're so busy they don't go to each other's homes, so they can't show that off. So they talk about it," she says. "Five years ago, they were constantly talking about Internet stocks and how they made millions on a $40,000 investment. Now it's real estate -- and that's done much better over the last two years than the stock market."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, says David Patrick Columbia, editor and founder of the online "New York Social Diary," uneasy lie the heads wearing New York's real estate crowns.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The state of euphoria has changed to fear -- big, big fear," says Columbia, who says disquiet is creeping into conversations among the elite. "We're obviously in a bubble, and people who know these things fear global disaster."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But down the income ladder, it's still party time. David Michonski, CEO of Coldwell Banker Hunt Kennedy, a top New York residential and commercial real estate brokerage, says rich people always have gossiped about their real estate. What's different now, he says, is that it's a "mass phenomenon," and it's nationwide.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michonski, however, says it's not impolite to brag. "Real estate allows everyone to look smart about accidental wealth. If people were actually responsible and made brilliant decisions, then bragging would be perceived as tacky. But most people say, 'I couldn't afford it today, but it's tripled in value since I bought it.' So it's not really bragging. You're not saying you're brilliant; you're calling attention to an accident."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michonski grows enthusiastic as he expands on an unusual theory: Buying real estate is the quintessential American act. "Buy a piece of America, and it helps make you richer," he says. "And it's OK to brag because that means you're being really American."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So there you have it: Bragging about your real estate can be an act of patriotism, not bad manners.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only in America.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tens of thousands of renters across the nation are facing a choice: Buy their apartments or move out as a wave of condominium conversions picks up speed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of apartments being renovated and sold as condos is escalating at a time when single-family homes are beyond the means of many Americans.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least 70,800 apartment units were sold to condominium developers nationwide in 2004, up from 7,800 in 2002, according to Real Capital Analytics, a New York consulting firm.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of June 1, at least 43,900 units have been sold to developers this year, says Dan Fasulo, director of market analysis for the firm. There are about 19 million rental apartments in the USA.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The conversions are occurring most rapidly in Southern California, Northern Virginia and the Miami and Las Vegas areas.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Converted condominiums, often much cheaper than single-family houses in the same market, are the only way for many residents to buy their first home. In San Diego County, the median price of a converted condo in May was $250,000 less than that of a single- family home, according to DataQuick Information Systems, a company in La Jolla, Calif., that tracks property information.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We take people normally collecting rental receipts in shoe boxes and make them homeowners," says Mark Lewis, mayor of the San Diego suburb of El Cajon, where 1,000 rental units are being converted.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local officials from San Diego to Alexandria, Va., are grappling with how to help tenants pushed out by the conversions. Many people are unable to buy and need rental housing in markets that have few vacancies.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Condominium conversions provide entry-level ownership opportunities," says Elizabeth Morris, CEO of the San Diego Housing Commission. "But there are concerns about what it does to the available supply of rental housing."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though a record 69% of households owned their homes last year, lower-cost rentals are dwindling, according to a study released last month by Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies. About 43% of rental units built in the past five years are renting for above $800 a month, compared with 25% of the units built before then.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some real estate analysts say conversions are not significantly depleting the supply of apartments.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's no question converting rental units in large numbers to condominium ownership units is going to reduce the stock of rental units, but it's not going to reduce it by as much as first cast," says Mark Obrinsky of the National Multi Housing Council in Washington, a trade association for the apartment rental industry.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though rents may rise temporarily on apartments that remain, they are likely to level off because many converted condos return to the marketplace as rentals, says Hessam Nadji of Marcus &amp; Millichap, a real estate investment firm in Encino, Calif.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some renters like the opportunity to buy. "It's going to be beneficial as long as there are programs to help people become first- time buyers," says James DeForest, who is working with a housing group to buy his bungalow unit in San Diego. "I've always rented, and I'm 48. That's a lot of rent money I've thrown away."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other tenants say their lives have been disrupted. "I really feel let down," says Valerie Enos, 62, who was told to vacate her El Cajon apartment last week. "I think everybody is being squeezed out so they can cater to the wealthier people. It's not a good feeling."  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The superheated housing market may be cooling a bit, numbers released Wednesday by a real estate industry group suggest.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors' pending home sales index shows that U.S. home resales that were pending in May actually slipped from April. The index stood at 124.9, or 2% below April's reading of 127.5.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The numbers, however, still are close to the index record of 128.1 in October last year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're looking at a banner year for the housing market," says David Lereah, NAR's chief economist. "The level of activity is still very, very high. But the dip does tell me that we're starting to run out of a little steam."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index covers pending sales of existing homes, including single-family houses, condominiums and co-ops. A pending sale is when the contract has been signed, but the sale has not closed. As every homeowner knows, a transaction can take weeks or months to close.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Realtors across the country tell the NAR that houses are taking a bit longer to sell, according to Lereah. Nor are bidding wars for properties nearly as rabid as they've been in recent months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In sizzling markets from California to Florida, some houses still sell in a day or two, with 15 bidders vying for desirable properties, he says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even some hot regions -- Los Angeles, San Diego, Chicago, Las Vegas -- are seeing houses stay on the market longer, with prices not rising as rapidly as before.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That should be good for the market, Lereah says, and suggests "a soft landing" is in store for buyers and sellers. He adds that there are no indications that "we're in a dangerous bubble," and real estate "still makes a healthy investment."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists say that housing prices in some markets have risen too rapidly in recent years and may face declines or a period of flat prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has warned of "froth" in some local markets, but says there is no national price bubble.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some indicators point to the market's underlying strength. A recent Mortgage Bankers Association report, for instance, shows an increase in mortgage applications, suggesting that pent-up demand still exists.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other key statistical indicators from government agencies and trade groups include higher interest rates, shrinking home prices and a slowdown in actual sales -- not only pending sales.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't think you can read too much into one month's movement," says Patrick Lawler, chief economist at the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to OFHEO, average U.S. home prices rose 12.5% in the first quarter from the same period a year earlier.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales and prices aren't weakening in Manhattan, a pricey market that still reflects the nationwide psychology of home buyers and sellers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average sales price in the current second quarter soared to a record $1.3million, up 9% from the first quarter, says Jonathan Miller, president of appraisal firm Miller Samuel. Sales of co-ops and condos have grown 7.5% to 2,181 from 2,028 in the first quarter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, Miller says, "It's a reasonable assumption that real- estate price levels cannot continue at this pace indefinitely."  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN DIEGO -- For James DeForest, the transformation of his rented apartment into a condominium for sale offers a chance at the American dream.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I called my mom and dad ... and let them know I could be a homeowner out here in California," says DeForest, 48, an operations coordinator for a Bed Bath &amp; Beyond store, who hopes to buy his bungalow unit and carry a mortgage for the first time. He expects to pay at least $300,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Valerie Shield, an elementary school principal in a different pocket of San Diego, the planned conversion into condos of an apartment complex where 75 of her students live means something less rosy: Many of their families will have to find new places to live.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These are people cleaning hotel rooms, busing tables," she says. "They can barely make the $900 to $1,000 rent. ... I'm worried about the children."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condo conversions such as these in San Diego's stratospheric housing market are gaining momentum in metropolitan areas around the nation. In places such as Miami, Las Vegas, Charlotte and Washington, D.C., developers are buying and renovating apartment buildings, then selling the units as condominiums.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The condos, often priced far less than new condominiums or single- family homes, offer some longtime renters a fleeting chance at homeownership. Tenants who can't scrape together a down payment or obtain financing must move.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Conversions create opportunities for entry-level purchases," says Gabe del Rio of Community HousingWorks in San Diego, which helps low- and moderate-income families. "Then we also see the other side. These are the very low-income individuals who have usually been in that complex for a very long time. ... They don't have many options."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rental-to-condo rush is particularly hot in Las Vegas, the nation's fastest-growing metro area. Ten thousand to 13,000 apartments were converted to condominiums last year in Clark County, which includes Las Vegas.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lower prices of converted condos are a big draw for would-be home buyers. Converted condos in Las Vegas cost $90,000 to $150,000. The median price of a new single-family home there is $305,500.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Converted condos are attractive to empty-nesters who want to downsize, but they are most popular with first-time home buyers, particularly firefighters, teachers and others who earn moderate incomes in expensive markets, says Walter Molony, spokesman for the Chicago-based National Association of Realtors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some cities where condo conversions are underway have the nation's lowest apartment vacancy rates, triggering concerns among local officials that renters are being left with few places to go.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Washington area, the vacancy rate for multifamily rental units was 3.6% as of July1, according to the Realtors group. The rate was 2.9% in Miami and 2.7% in San Diego. The projected national average vacancy rate this year is 5.7%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are definitely concerned about the displacement (of tenants) and the loss of rental housing, particularly affordable rental housing," says Melodie Baron, division chief for the Office of Housing in Alexandria, Va. Since November, applications have been filed to convert 2,365 rental units in that city.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's what some cities are doing to ease the crunch:  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Alexandria is offering interest-free loans of as much as $40,000 to tenants with moderate incomes who want to buy their unit when it goes condo.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Clark County in Nevada is allowing homeowners on lots of 5,000 square feet or more to build another structure that they could rent to people who are not family members.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*The San Diego City Council has set aside $1.9 million for loans to displaced renters who earn the area's median income of $64,000 a year or less. Displaced tenants receive three months' rent, which they can use for a down payment on a home or another rental.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DeForest was worried when he learned five months ago that his bungalow community was going condo.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was a little scary because everything is just sky-high here ... and I don't make a whole lot of money," he says. But he also saw a chance to become a homeowner.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fiel Barrow, 29, who attends San Diego State University, paid $217,000 in April for a converted one-bedroom condo. He says he was able to buy only because of the relatively low cost of the condo and loans he obtained through programs for first-time home buyers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mayor Mark Lewis of El Cajon, a San Diego suburb where apartments make up 52% of housing, welcomes conversions. Conversions enable residents to put down roots, and they also increase tax revenue for city services, he says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Art Madrid, mayor of neighboring La Mesa, isn't so sure conversions help his town. La Mesa ties the number of conversions it will allow to the number of apartments built in the previous two years. No apartments have been constructed in the past decade.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think we have a legal and moral responsibility to make sure that the residents who've lived here for years and years aren't displaced just for the sake of money," Madrid says.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">USA TODAY's story "Unbuilt houses flooding listings" somehow managed to argue that an increase in the number of homes that have been permitted by local jurisdictions, but not yet started by builders or sold to buyers, adds to concerns about overbuilding, speculative buying and housing bubbles (News, June 21).  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's true that the number of permitted but not-yet-started homes has increased in absolute terms and as a share of the Census Bureau's estimate of the inventory of new homes for sale.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's also true that the overall inventory-to-sales ratio, including those units, is historically low. Thus, the inventory situation is fundamentally healthy, and the rise in the share of homes that have not yet been started partly reflects efforts by builders to sell homes before construction begins, which is a very healthy practice.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Furthermore, drawn-out regulatory processes in many local jurisdictions have encouraged builders to accumulate an unusually large supply of unused permits to be able to meet future housing demand. Once a permit is obtained, the Census Bureau classifies the home as "for sale."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's clearly wrong to conclude that a sizeable backlog of unbuilt homes for sale suggests an impending housing "glut." If housing demand weakens, builders can easily defer starts of homes that have been permitted.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, inventory management in the home-building industry has been excellent for years, and the public companies know that stock analysts watch their inventories very closely.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unsold units that are completed or under construction could eventually become a problem, but unsold units that have not even been started are clearly a relatively benign matter.  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Prices of existing homes hit a new peak in May, as sales remained near record highs, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday in a report that made it clear the historic housing market is still going strong.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes, townhouses, condos and co-ops were the second-highest on record in May, at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 7.13 million units. That's down 0.7% from April's peak but 3.5% above May 2004. The median price of an existing home rose to $207,000, up 12.5% from a year ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Most of the stars continue to be correctly aligned for the housing market," says NAR chief economist David Lereah, with sales driven by low mortgage rates, high demand and a good economy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has been on a record-setting pace since the late 1990s. A growing number of economists, including Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, worry about speculation in some markets, and warn that several large cities, particularly on the East and West coasts, could be overheated.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though the Fed has been increasing short-term interest rates since last June, long-term mortgage rates remain low. Mortgage giant Freddie Mac said the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 5.57% in the week ended Thursday, from 5.63% the last week. Last year, the average was 6.25%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Fed has been singularly unsuccessful in cooling down the hot U.S. housing market," says Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at consulting firm Global Insight.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Behravesh predicts bond rates will rise by as much as a full percentage point over the next year, pulling mortgage rates up with them and cooling the real estate market without creating a crash.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A panel of 10 economists advising the American Bankers Association expressed some concern about housing Thursday as part of a broader forecast for slightly slower U.S. economic growth.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The American Bankers Association Economic Advisory Committee predicted home prices will rise through 2006. While they said the risk of declining values was "not pervasive," they added that the number of highly overvalued housing markets, now a fifth of the country, is growing, along with the odds of price corrections in those areas.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their overall forecast is for the economy to expand 3.5% on an annual basis through the end of 2005, and at a little over 3% in 2006. They expect inflation to stabilize around 2%, and the Fed to increase short-term rates, now at 3%, to 4%-4.25% by next spring, with mortgage rates rising to 6.5% by the end of 2006.  </p>

</div><div class="author">John Waggoner  </div><div>528 words</div><div>21 June 2005</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>A.1</div><div>English</div><div>© 2005 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of houses for sale even before they're built has jumped 47% the past 12 months, adding to worries that overbuilding and speculation could bring the housing boom to a bust.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Census Bureau says that 88,000 houses were for sale but not yet started in April, the latest data available, compared with 60,000 a year earlier and 40,000 five years ago. The numbers track houses scheduled to be built in developments where buyers can view plans or models. April's number is the highest since the government began tracking the statistic in 1973.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The appetite for new homes is strong: There is about a 4.1-month supply of new houses for sale, up just 0.1% from 12 months earlier. That's low.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a glut of new houses could end the housing boom -- and, possibly, stick builders and speculators with undeveloped property if the boom goes bust. "Builders have a long pipeline for development that will be difficult for them to shut down, even when demand begins to weaken," says Mark Zandi, chief economist for Economy.com. "They are geared for growth, and it will be hard for them to pull back."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another worry: Unbuilt homes for sale could be used for flipping, buying in hopes of selling for a quick profit. In pre-construction flipping, a speculator puts a deposit down on an unbuilt home and sells it on completion -- or even before.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A survey released Monday by the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) shows that investors accounted for 11% of single- home purchases in 30 metro areas with hot real estate markets, vs. about 3% of purchases from 12 large national home builders.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most major contractors are taking steps to forbid flipping. "Flipping concerns economists and regulators and those interested in not seeing their home values go down," says Robert Toll, CEO of Toll Bros.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A half-finished development could have contractors and speculators competing for buyers. According to the NAHB, 64% of builders surveyed wouldn't let buyers sell the home or contract before closing. Also, 82% said they would sell only to buyers who would occupy the homes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some builders are looking the other way, and they are touted on Internet sites such as getpreconstructionprofits.com. "Major builders are being strict about their own development, but it won't do much good if the developer across the street isn't," says G. Kenneth Heebner, manager of CGM Realty Fund.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, the increase in unsold, unbuilt houses hasn't translated into a glut of homes for sale. But Zandi and others worry that unsold homes eventually will weigh on the market. "Builders are incredibly optimistic about long-term demographic fundamentals," he says. "It suggests they won't turn cautious when demand does begin to weaken."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others see the rise as one more sign of a housing bubble, along with the sharp climb in interest-only and adjustable-rate mortgages. "It shows that we are where we've never been before," says James Grant, editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One recent day in sunny Sarasota, Fla., the owner of an 18th- floor condo with picturesque views of the Gulf of Mexico walked into real estate agent Terrence Cook's office and said, "I'd like to sell it."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Says Cook of Coldwell Banker: "He's looking at a double." As in doubling his money.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a bigger factor behind the seller's request to "cash out," Cook recalls, was a gnawing fear that the overheated Florida housing market may be vulnerable to a price drop. (Cook downplays talk of a real estate bubble.) Rather than risk watching profit melt away if the real estate market turns suddenly chilly -- as some economists insist is inevitable -- Cook's client wants to pocket his cash now.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With prices in the hottest housing markets in Florida, California, Nevada, Arizona and New Jersey soaring 20% or more in the 12 months ended in March, real estate is increasingly being compared to the frenzied buying of Nasdaq stocks in the late 1990s. The sizzling market -- and the riches it is bestowing on homeowners - - is prompting real estate investors to address a question stockholders inevitably face when stocks post gargantuan gains: Should I sell and pocket my gains?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, dumping a house on Main Street in search of profit is a far more complex and emotional decision than selling a winning stock on Wall Street. A stock is just a piece of paper, a dollar amount on an account statement, a ticker symbol. A house is a home, a library of family memories, a roof over one's head, a status symbol. "It's your piece of the American pie," says Walter Molony, a spokesman for the National Association of Realtors (NAR).  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Emotional heartstrings aside, selling a home, no matter how much it has appreciated, is still a business decision that requires thoughtful analysis. "Selling a house is not a $9.95 transaction," says Lawrence Yun, senior economist at the NAR.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, anecdotal evidence suggests that some people have cashed out and many more are thinking about it.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is something that we may start to see a little bit more of" as prices keep heading higher, Cook says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider Penny Dorneman. She and her husband recently sold their Connecticut home and moved to Boston. But instead of paying top dollar for a home in Red Sox nation, they banked their $128,000 profit and rent a $2,885-a-month apartment. "Prices are insane," says Dorneman, 47. "Is Boston really a 20-times-better place to live than someplace else?"  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Art Munson, 64, of Toluca Lake, Calif., also opted to take the money and run. He pocketed an 800% gain on the home he lived in for 25 years. He now rents. "Things were getting out of hand with real estate prices," he says. "I lived through a number of real estate dives, so we decided to take the risk and sell."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Risk in selling? That's right.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While selling fast-appreciating real estate may seem like a no- brainer, it is not risk free.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pros of selling  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One benefit of selling in a hot market is you get to transform your home into a winning lottery ticket. A couple can pocket a tax- free gain of $500,000 if they've lived in the home two of the past five years. And if prices drop sharply, you'll be able to get back in the market at lower prices and avoid paying inflated prices to move to a bigger home.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists, Realtors and financial planners say cashing out makes the most sense for people moving from high-cost to low-cost markets; retirees looking to bolster their nest eggs; empty-nester parents looking to downsize; and people who truly believe the housing boom will result in a stock market-like bust.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For people doing it for sound, long-term reasons, it could be the right decision," says Kurt Brouwer of wealth advisory firm Brouwer &amp; Janachowski.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another potential plus of selling is you might sidestep financial pain. While housing price drops have historically been far less dramatic than stock losses -- ("A Nasdaq-like plunge," NAR's Yun says, "has never occurred in the history of housing.") -- there have been a handful of past housing busts in isolated markets that clipped 20% off prices and took almost a decade to recover.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, however, there has not been one year since 1968 in which the median price of a house declined, the NAR says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But frothy markets can nose-dive. In Los Angeles, housing prices tumbled 19.5% from a peak in 1989 to a low in 1996 after the Southern California economy swooned because of massive layoffs in the defense industry. It took 11 years for prices to get back to their 1989 peak. A similar collapse occurred in Houston in the early 1980s when plunging oil prices hurt that local economy. The median home in Houston went from $79,900 in 1983 to $61,800 in 1988, a 22.7% drop. Prices did not recover until 1992. Prices also declined in New York City from 1988 to 1995, with the median price of a single-family home falling $14,100.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cons of selling  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the biggest risk of selling, besides having to find another place to buy or paying rent, is selling too early.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People who listened to bubbleologists (predicting doom) four years ago missed out on huge appreciation," NAR's Molony says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Molony would not rule out future gains for already pricey real estate. He notes that the ingredients required to take the air out of the housing market -- economic calamity, a weak job market and expensive borrowing costs -- are not present. What's more, key drivers of housing, such as tight supplies and surging demand from immigrants and well-to-do baby boomers, could keep the housing boom alive longer than pundits suggest.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another downside to selling real estate is that it is far more costly and time consuming than selling a stock. You'll also lose the tax deduction for mortgage interest.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Stocks can be sold in seconds, but it may take two to four months to complete a real estate transaction," NAR's Yun says. A stock transaction can be had for less than $10, whereas selling a house results in outlays in the thousands for commissions and closing costs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The real question," says Randall Guttery, a professor of real estate at the University of North Texas, "is what do you do with the money" you made from selling your house?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investment alternatives are slim, he says. The stock market is struggling this year, with the Dow Jones industrial average down 2%. And low yields on bonds and money market funds are nothing to get excited about either. That brings us back to real estate.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Says Coldwell Banker's Cook: "I hate to say you can't go wrong with real estate, but ..."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">---  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When 'cashing out' makes sense:  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Sell high, buy low. Selling the pricey digs in high-cost markets, such as New York and Los Angeles, and buying into a low- cost market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Sell the "empty nest." Just shipped your kids off to college and don't need five bedrooms anymore? Consider downsizing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Sell to fund retirement. Planning to sell anyway over the next year or two when you're done working? You might want to do it now and feather your nest egg.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Sell to avoid disaster. If you truly think it is a bubble and prices are on the verge of collapse, get out now to avoid future regret.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ingredients for a real estate correction:  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Economic relapse. If the economy tanks, due to a financial or Sept. 11-type event, demand will decline.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Job losses. Without a paycheck, it's tough to pay the mortgage.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Rising interest rates. Higher borrowing costs make housing less affordable.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Excess supply. Inventory is tight. But if overbuilding occurs and demand wanes, prices will fall.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- U.S. home building advanced at a heady pace in May, fueled by strong demand and low interest rates, amid conflicting evidence about whether the market will remain strong or start to level off.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said Thursday that housing starts rose to a 2.01 million annual pace, up 0.2% from April and 1.8% from a year ago. Building permits, a gauge of future activity, fell 4.6% from April and about 4% from last year. Housing starts have been above a 2 million annual rate for most of the past 10 months, though the pace of expansion has slowed since the beginning of the year -- a sign the market could be topping out.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While new housing activity remains near record highs, we are starting to see some cooling. ... Building permits also point to some moderation," declining for the third time in four months, Merrill Lynch analyst David Rosenberg told clients.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve's beige book, an anecdotal account of economic conditions from May to early June, saw slowing in some markets.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The beige book said the inventory of unsold homes rose in Detroit, while some builders in Dallas and Houston said construction was ahead of demand. In the Cleveland region, several home builders had above-average cancellations.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another sign that stresses are building in some markets: In Minneapolis-St. Paul, home foreclosures through April were up 17.7% from a year ago. Toby Madden, regional economist for the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, says the trend was probably due in part to higher market volume and the use of adjustable-rate mortgages that can pinch when rates rise. In Hennepin County, home of Minneapolis, there were 951 foreclosures in 2002, 1,223 in 2004 and 515 through April this year. Nationally, foreclosure rates have not surged, however.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing research firm DataQuick said Thursday that sales in the San Francisco Bay Area were down 6% from last May. Still, prices rose 17.6% from a year ago to a median $595,000. That's down from January's annual 20.5% appreciation. Median means half are higher and half are lower.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, others see little sign of moderation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dallas real estate agent Linda Lanham of Keller Williams Realty said she saw only typical seasonal changes in sales. She is getting calls from investors across the country and overseas. And the beige book noted that a Virginia Beach real estate agent sold more than $12 million in properties in 10 days.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fannie Mae chief economist David Berson Thursday raised his estimate for home sales and said it was possible 2005 could set a record.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising rates could slow the market. Mortgage giant Freddie Mac said Thursday that 30-year fixed mortgage rates rose to an average 5.63% this week. That's up from 5.56% the previous week, though below the 6.32% of a year ago.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising home values may be making some homeowners wealthy, but lofty prices are creating a financial strain on many Americans stretching to buy a home.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Roughly one in eight of U.S. households now devote at least half of their income to housing costs, says a study by Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies. One in three devote a third of their income to housing, a tad more than banks prefer.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of an existing single-family home rose 7.7% to $184,100 last year, the study said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Housing affordability is a chronic problem," notes the center's director, Nicolas Retsinas.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report, The State of the Nation's Housing: 2005, is the latest proof that a rapid escalation in home prices presents opportunities and risks.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the bullish side, the report stresses that the housing boom -- fueled by cheap loans, tight supply in major metro areas and increased demand from immigrants, minorities and prosperous baby boomers -- will continue in 2005.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Citing those factors, residential real estate could continue to fare well over the next 10 years, the report noted.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it also chronicled a laundry list of data that suggest some homeowners may be making bigger trade-offs than they realize.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home-buying boom, the report says, has been spurred in large part by creative financing options, such as interest-only and adjustable-rate mortgages, which offer lower monthly payments in the early years of the loan.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Some buyers are taking more risk than they think," says Tony Ogorek, principal of Ogorek Capital Management.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They could get burned if the economy worsens or interest rates rise sharply.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other signs that home buyers may be breaking the budget:  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Home prices outpacing paychecks. The number of metro areas where homeowners are paying at least four times their income for a home has more than tripled to 33 from 10 in the past five years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Tiny down payments in vogue. In 1990, only 3% of conventional loans had down payments of 5% or less, vs. roughly 17% of loans today.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Investor purchases on rise. From 1998 to 2003, the number of loans made to investors climbed to 11% from 7%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Longer commutes. In search of cheaper digs, the number of people who commute an hour or more to work rose by 3.1 million in the 1990s.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For owners already in the real estate market it has been a great ride," says Richard DeKaser, chief economist at National City Corp. "But ... (non-owners) are increasingly being shut out or resorting to unusual means to get in."  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MIAMI -- Manuel Iraola would be one of the National Association of Realtors' worst nightmares -- if it knew he existed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, Iraola, a former president of Phelps Dodge Industries, launched an Internet-based real estate company that seems designed to drive traditional Realtors out of business. His Homekeys website is a how-to guide to buying and selling a home in Florida without paying a traditional broker.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Technology has influenced the expectations of consumers," Iraola says. "People don't need to be driven around in a Cadillac to see properties."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's one of the big worries of the Realtors-with-a-capital-R. Though it's hard to find evidence they're struggling at a time of dizzying real estate prices, traditional real estate agents are uneasy about retaining their longtime lock on the market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their trade group has been in talks with antitrust officials about a new Realtors policy that would limit the home listings that some low-cost online brokers could show on their websites. Under threat of a Justice Department lawsuit, the group agreed last month to drop the policy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's unclear if that'll be enough to satisfy antitrust officials, who continue to field complaints from online brokers about other aspects of Realtors' Internet policies.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fight about listings is part of a broader effort by the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission to quash what they call Realtor attempts in several states to prevent online brokers and other discounters from competing with them. Federal antitrust enforcers want consumers to have wider access to home listings and an easier time negotiating fees lower than the typical 6% commission shared by buyer and seller agents.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What you have is an industry that is using every tool they have to protect their commission structure and protect their interests," says Van Davis, CEO of Foxtons Real Estate, a discount firm. Davis formerly headed Century 21 Real Estate, one of the biggest realty firms.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But others say the Realtors' interests also protect consumers. Allyson Bernard, an NAR vice president who has a real estate firm in Danbury, Conn., says many people underestimate the role of Realtors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A lot of the work that a Realtor will do, from getting a transaction from beginning to end, is done behind the scenes, so people don't realize it," Bernard says. "When there's nobody there to watch in between, that's when things fall apart (and) when it gets dangerous for a consumer."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A thriving industry  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rising scrutiny comes as real estate agents are both thriving and feeling under siege. NAR membership is up to 1.1 million, from nearly 770,000 four years ago. A white-hot housing market and slower growth in other parts of the economy have lured people into the field.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Internet hasn't quite ushered in the revolution in sales and pricing many predicted -- or feared. NAR says its research shows, for example, that the proportion of people who sell their homes by themselves -- 15% -- is about the same as it was 25 years ago. But the Web has still been a major influence.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three out of four home buyers use the Internet to search for a house, NAR says. A 2004 survey of nearly 3,000 NAR members found that nearly 90% used e-mail to communicate with clients and that 52% had websites.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate advertising is also gravitating to the Internet. Borrell Associates, a media research and consulting firm, predicts a 55% increase this year from 2004, to $1.8billion.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The struggle with antitrust enforcers shows that many traditional real estate agents fear the heightened competition from real estate websites and discount brokers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"He or she who controls the information controls the process," Iraola says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As home sales and prices shatter records, some consumers are balking at paying the traditional commission. Clients in sizzling markets, such as in South Florida, are asking whether brokers should earn twice as much, in dollar terms, on a sale as they did five years ago for the same job.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Discounters enjoy gains  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, discount brokerage firms are posting double- digit gains. Real estate agents, struggling to find houses for their clients in hot markets, are lowering fees or working with discounters.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Debbie and Robert Viator sold their Fort Lauderdale home last month through Homekeys, saving $23,000 in commissions on the $575,000 sale price.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They paid $79 for a one-month subscription to Homekeys' "premium" research and the $99 fee to post their home in Homekeys' "multiple listing service" data -- the listings Realtors pay to receive and have their properties included in.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Debbie Viator says she found the experience similar to having a real estate agent. Homekeys helped the Viators prepare their counter- offers. Staff attorneys with Homekeys' title company went over their contract before the closing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics say some online brokers are providing only minimal services to clients -- merely posting a house on a website for a fee, for example -- while other real estate agents shoulder the work of showing homes, processing offers, negotiating paperwork, helping find financing and handling other details needed to close a sale.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A lot of the discount brokers are just taking a fee ... and listing in the (Multiple Listing Service used by Realtors) so other licensed brokers can see it," says Texas House Rep. Joe Pickett, a licensed Realtor who wrote an amendment that the Texas Legislature passed. His amendment would require real estate agents to provide a minimum level of services -- instead of just listing a house on a website and leaving consumers to seal the deal.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some cases, discounters offer enticements to lure people away from the traditional commission system; hence the fights raging at the state and local levels.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some discount realtors say Pickett's legislation is intended to edge out Web-based brokers. Pickett says he's protecting consumers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I just can't understand the fury" about requiring basic services, such as answering questions or passing an offer on to sellers, Pickett says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Realtors insist that when you look at the way their industry is evolving, theirs is one of the most competitive sectors around.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's hard to find a more competitive business than this," says Steve Cook, the Realtor association's vice president for public affairs. "You will meet ... dozens of highly qualified professionals out there eager to work for you, and every one of them is willing to negotiate."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some online brokers say the problem is that agents aren't passing their gains onto clients. Unlike other businesses that have cut prices as technology has boosted productivity, many Realtors still demand the standard 6% commission.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cutting commissions  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Douglas Searles, a Michigan life insurance company analyst, listed his Grand Rapids home on ForSaleByOwner.com because he didn't want to pay nearly $5,000 -- 3% of his home's selling price of $160,000 -- to a seller's agent to do what he and his wife could do themselves. (He did offer to pay a buyer's agent a 3% commission to boost interest in his home and wound up selling his house to a Virginia-based buyer with an agent in two months.)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without having to pay a commission to a selling agent, Searles says he had more flexibility in the price he could accept.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If more of us start to list on ForSaleByOwner, we can eliminate the monopoly Realtors hold on home listings, and it will also lower the amount of money they receive from their commissions, which are currently too high for the work that they do," Searles says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patrick Lashinsky, a vice president of ZipRealty, a full-service discount brokerage that charges 20% off the traditional fee, says he feels it's "wrong" that while home prices are surging, "the commission structure hasn't changed since Eisenhower was president."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By letting potential home buyers weed out properties on the Internet, his agents have to personally accompany clients to only half as many houses as traditional firms, Lashinsky says. The company saw its revenue soar from $4 million in 2001 to $62 million in 2004.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's like they (NAR) want to go back to before 1980 and say, 'We're not going to allow the Internet to be allowed as a tool,'" Lashinsky says, asking how it serves either buyers or sellers not to have a listing as widely distributed as possible.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adapting to the Web  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cook counters with the assertion that the industry has evolved well:  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Name me an industry that adapted to the Internet better than this one ... an industry where you can look at the inventory 24/7 in your bedroom slippers. Consumers who shop for homes by the Internet are more likely to look for a real estate professional than those who don't. The reason is that there is so much information out there."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iraola, who moved his family 12 times in his career, had plans to retire in 2003 in South Florida and make money buying and selling homes. He felt that Realtors had cost his former company a fortune by mispricing his homes and was certain that he could do it better.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After spending two years investigating what other sites were offering and how technology could distinguish their business, Iraola and a partner, Mario Villena, launched their own site in Florida in March. On that site, they say, people can find everything they need to buy or sell a property.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homekeys offers sellers the chance to save half or up to all of the typical 6% commission. Those who want to sell their home completely on their own can post a property listing on the site's free "owner listing service" and can research other listings in their area for free.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each weekday morning, the 57-year-old Iraola drives his black Mercedes-Benz E-Class from his home in Coral Gables -- one of four homes he owns -- to his fledgling company's headquarters in downtown Miami. He oversees a staff of 16 -- brokers and others who deal with clients online or by phone.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He dreams that Homekeys will become a leader in high-quality real estate service, just as Phelps-Dodge was a leader in mining and chemical production. But he says he knows what he's up against with the Realtors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're on the vanguard of a revolution," Iraola says. "But I thought the oil companies were powerful." --- O'Donnell reported from Miami and McLean, Va.; Kirchhoff reported from Washington  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The average price of a U.S. home jumped 12.5% from the first quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005 -- one of the heftiest increases in the past 25 years, the government said Wednesday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From January to March, average home prices increased 2.2%, an 8.8% annual rate. During the past five years, prices have zoomed 50.5%, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Arizona had the most rapid growth in the first quarter of 2005, with prices up 5.2%. Nevada was the fastest-growing state over the 12-month period, with 31.2% appreciation. Texas, where prices rose 3.8% in the past year, was slowest.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data added to concern that the housing market, expanding at a record pace since the late 1990s, is overheated. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan recently noted "froth" in some markets, though discounting a nationwide price bubble. Lenders report an increasing number of borrowers taking out adjustable rate or unconventional loans as they stretch to buy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The rise in house prices continues at an extremely strong pace and raises the potential for declines in some areas later on," said OFHEO Chief Economist Patrick Lawler.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The OFHEO released its data as the Commerce Department said construction spending hit a record in April, rising 0.5% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.07 trillion. It was the 15th month of record activity. There was growth in housing, manufacturing, commercial, retail and other construction.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also Wednesday, the National Association of Realtors said its index of pending home sales was up, indicating record sales of existing homes are possible when May and June figures are released.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The index tells us that historic home sales are likely to continue," said NAR Chief Economist David Lereah.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The OFHEO said California, Hawaii, Washington, D.C., Florida, Maryland and Virginia were among the hottest markets last year. And 14 of the 20 cities with the fastest appreciation were in California, four in Florida and two in Nevada.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices rose less than 5% in the past year in Michigan, Mississippi, Kansas, Colorado, Ohio, Oklahoma, Indiana and Texas. North Dakota prices fell 0.4% in the first quarter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The full report shows no sign of deflating, let alone bursting, bubbles," says Kenneth Simonson, chief economist of the Associated General Contractors of America. "The one state with a first-quarter decline was North Dakota, where I imagine only the desperate would sell a house from January to March."  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not enough to keep up with the Joneses. Now, homeowners want to know how much their neighbors paid for their house and how much their own is worth -- even if they have no intention of selling.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home-buying boom has created legions of real estate voyeurs cruising free websites such as Domania, ForSaleByOwner.com and HomeRadar.com to find sales prices for homes in their neighborhoods.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many who peruse these sites are people looking for an edge as they buy and sell homes. Others surf these sites to obsessively track what's increasingly their No.1 investment -- their house -- much as they would check a stock's price. And then there are those who just enjoy anonymously spying on their neighbors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is the new form of snooping in somebody else's medicine cabinet. In this case, the shelf won't fall down," says Mark Lesswing, technology guru for the National Association of Realtors (NAR).  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As real estate becomes the national conversation, 21.6 million Web surfers, or 15% of the active Web population, visited a real estate or apartment site in April, up 26% from six months ago, Nielsen/NetRatings says. Traffic to the top 10 sites is up 54% that same period. The percentage of home shoppers who use the Internet in their search is now 74%, the NAR says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Domania offers registered members actual sales prices of homes rather than listings. That helps prospective home buyers get a fix on prices on areas they're interested in. They can check how many times a home has turned over and at what price. Homeowners can track the appreciation of their home by comparing sales prices, or "comps," of similar homes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Domania has registered nearly 1 million users in five years. It had 751,000 unique visitors in April, a 313% increase from six months earlier. Almost half of the visitors are "lookie-loos," says Ben Joslin, Domania's vice president of marketing, adding that the data can be an "irresistible draw" for consumers looking to snoop on their neighbors. "Even if you're not buying or selling your house, you want to know what houses are selling for in your neighborhood," Joslin says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While information on these sites could raise privacy concerns, most of it is available publicly through county real estate assessment sites, townships, newspapers and consumer surveys, according to Colby Sambrotto, chief operating officer at ForSaleByOwner.com. The site has posted a 142% increase in unique visitors the past six months, according to Nielsen/NetRatings.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One problem: Some public information can be old. So consumers should do their own homework with local real estate agents and county offices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is similar to consumers going to (Kelley Blue Book) before they sell their cars," Lesswing says. "If this makes you a more informed consumer, then it's good for business."  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Prices and sales of previously owned homes hit records last month, according to a report out Tuesday that heightened concerns the housing market is becoming dangerously overheated.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of a home sold in the USA was $206,000 in April, up 6.7% from March and 15.1% from April 2004, the National Association of Realtors said. It was the first time the median price was above $200,000 and was the biggest year-over-year price gain in nearly 25 years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median is the point at which half of the homes sold above and half sold below.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes, meanwhile, rose 4.5% from March on a seasonally adjusted, annual basis to 7.2 million, also a record. Activity was the strongest in the South but was also up in the Midwest and Northeast. Sales were flat in the West.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report confirms the housing market is on track for another record year, again defying expectations of a slowdown, Action Economics chief economist Mike Englund says. It also suggests buyers are ignoring talk that the housing market in some parts of the country is potentially forming a dangerous bubble, which could burst.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This discussion of a bubble really doesn't seem to be influencing decisions," Englund says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data came days after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told the New York Economic Club Friday that he saw "froth" in some local housing markets but discounted the notion there was a nationwide housing bubble forming, according to Bloomberg News.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greenspan predicted that the large increases in home prices would soon ease. He said that although some markets could see actual price declines, most homeowners who bought before the recent run-up in prices will still likely find their houses worth more than what they paid.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing has been held up in large part by rock-bottom mortgage rates, which have stayed low despite a nearly yearlong effort at the Fed to raise its target for short-term interest rates. The average rate for a 30-year, fixed mortgage was 5.86% in April, down from 5.93% in March. In April 2004, the rate was 5.83%.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates typically increase as Fed officials raise interest rates. But a number of factors, including long-term expectations for low inflation, are holding down long-term bond yields, which have a greater impact on mortgage rates.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also continuing to propel housing have been gains in job creation in recent months. "We see all the positive factors coming together to coincide with a powerful demographic demand for housing," NAR chief economist David Lereah said in a statement.  </p>
