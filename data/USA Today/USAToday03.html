<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economic growth has been paltry for three straight quarters, but analysts expect a report this week to show the slump finally ended in the July to September period. A rebound could go a long way toward making Federal Reserve policymakers feel comfortable enough to raise interest rates in coming months for the first time this year. This week's reports also feature readings on consumer confidence, business investment and new home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer confidence hit a nine-year high in September amid steady job gains, cheap gasoline and a generally lofty stock market. But the <span class="companylink">University of Michigan</span>'s consumer sentiment index for October tumbled on uncertainty surrounding the presidential election, particularly among low-income households. Partly as a result, economists expect the Conference Board on Tuesday to report a moderate decline in its consumer confidence measure that would still leave it at a healthy level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans' solid outlook is helping buoy the housing market this year. Yet after three straight monthly gains, new home sales fell sharply in August, probably because it was simply due for a pullback, says Nomura economist Lewis Alexander. Noting that in September existing home sales rose and mortgage applications continued to advance, he expects the Commerce Department on Wednesday to announce that new home sales increased modestly last month. But economists surveyed by Bloomberg believe the reading will reveal some further payback for the previous gains with a slight 1. 5% dip to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 600,000 new home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, Commerce will turn to one of the weaker cogs in the country's economic engine: business investment. Capital spending has been sluggish since 2014, largely as a result of the oil industry downturn, and a strong dollar and weak global economy that have clobbered exports. Although crude prices have risen and the dollar has weakened this year, partly reversing the previous trends, business spending has remained listless, in part because of the election-related jitters. Economists estimate that Commerce's report on durable goods will reveal that core capital orders excluding aircraft and defense -- a proxy for business investment -- were flat last month after sliding 4. 4% in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sluggish business spending likely continued to serve as a drag on economic growth in the third quarter, as did a decline in housing construction. But a substantial rise in exports and solid consumer spending -- which makes up about 70% of economic activity -- likely more than offset those negatives, Alexander says. After three quarters of subpar average growth of about 1% at an annual rate, economists reckon that Commerce on Friday will report the economy grew a solid 2. 5% annualized in the third quarter.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates are soaring right along with home sales, with both rising to four-month highs, according to data released Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home buyers may be shopping now to try to get ahead of the Federal Reserve as the board considers a potential interest-rate increase before the end of the year, which would lead to higher borrowing costs. Many were lured to check into buying their first home by historic low mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some potential buyers are finding there aren't a lot of worthy homes for sale, which is leading to higher prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage for the week ending Thursday was 3. 52%, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>'s Primary Mortgage Market Survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That reflected a 0. 05 percentage point increase from last week's 3. 47%. But it was still lower than a year earlier, when rates averaged 3. 79%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rates hadn't topped 3. 5% since June, according to mortgage buyer <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the National Association of Realtors reported that sales of existing homes rose 3. 2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5. 47 million, the highest mark since June. Sales rose across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of available homes was 2. 04 million, down 6. 8% from a year ago. Tight inventories drove the median price of existing homes up 5. 6% from a year ago to $234,200. The institutional investors who bought up homes in recent years have continued to rent them out rather than putting them on the market. Moreover, homebuilders have not aggressively stepped up construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> reported that 15-year fixed rate mortgages averaged 2. 79%, up from 2. 76% a week earlier and down from 2. 98% a year earlier.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts tumbled 9% to 1.047 million in September, down from August's revised rate of 1.15million. The figure is 11.9% lower from a year earlier. Economists track housing starts closely as a gauge for the housing market's health. The decline was concentrated principally in apartment complexes, which are often volatile. Housing starts on complexes with five or more units fell 38.9% from a month earlier.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As M&amp;M's celebrate its 75th anniversary, the popular candy is embracing something new: caramel. Starting next May, you'll be able to buy M&amp;M's filled with caramel. The addition of caramel is a first to the popular candy line, which has embraced fillings including pretzels, peanut butter and almond.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow, boosted by earnings beats by leading companies in the financial and energy sectors, pushed higher Wednesday as notched its first back-to-back daily gains in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones industrial average rose 41 points, or 0. 2%, to close at 18,203 as it built on Tuesdays gain of nearly 76 points. The broad <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500 stock index was 0. 2% higher to 2144 and the Nasdaq composite rose 0. 1% to 5246.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks got a boost from better-than-expected earnings reports from Wall Street bank <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley (MS) </span>and oil services company Halliburton (HAL).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street is closely watching the third-quarter earnings season, as the S&amp;P 500 has posted negative profit growth the prior four quarters and investors are hoping the July-thru-September quarter marks the end of the so-called earnings recession. On Tuesday, the earnings growth rate for the third quarter moved back into positive territory, showing growth of 0. 2%, according to earnings-tracker Thomson Reuters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> shares were up 1. 9% and Halliburton stock was trading 4. 3% higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Halliburton also got a boost from a bullish day in the energy patch. Oil prices were solidly in the black, with a barrel of U. S. -produced crude rising 2. 8% to $51. 70 per barrel. The crude gains were fueled by upbeat comments from the top Saudi energy minister, who said in a speech in London that the end of the long downturn in oil prices is growing closer following OPEC's recent decision to make minor cuts to output.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Market sentiment also got a boost from economic data out of China, where third-quarter GDP came in at 6. 7%, inline with expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street is also awaiting tonight's final presidential debate between Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump. Most polls show Clinton in the lead, so investors will be watching to see if the final face-to-face battle between the two candidates impacts the polls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose slightly to 1. 746%. The U. S. dollar also declined 0. 2% vs. a basket of foreign currencies, providing a lift for the outlook of U. S. exporters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In economic news, September housing starts in the U. S. fell a more than expected 9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks in Asia closed little changed. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 rose 0. 2% but the Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell 0. 4%</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Europe, the broad Stoxx Europe 600 index rose 0. 3%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy expanded at a modest to moderate pace from late August to early October, the Federal Reserve said Wednesday, as a pickup in retail sales and housing offset a mixed picture for manufacturing. But job growth was tempered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed's beige book, which provides an anecdotal account of the economy, was largely similar to recent editions, but its subdued description of payroll and wage growth seemed to match the official pullback reported by the Labor Department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report could provide more clues to what Federal Reserve officials will do about interest rates. The U. S. central bank is widely expected to raise interest rates by the end of the year. While the housing market continued a solid recovery, limited inventories continued to constrain sales. And a strong dollar is still curtailing manufacturers' exports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The overall outlook was "mostly positive, with growth expected to continue at a slight to moderate pace" in several regions, the beige book said. Hiring was strongest in the Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis and San Francisco regions. And while manufacturers laid off workers in New York, Philadelphia and Cleveland, energy-related job cuts eased and factory payrolls were stable in Dallas following recent reductions tied to the oil industry downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, labor shortages again were spotted across the country, with employers struggling to hire workers in construction, manufacturing, hospitality, health care, trucking and sales. Although wage growth was tepid, the shortages put upward pressure on pay for skilled workers in the Philadelphia area and entry-level positions in the St. Louis and San Francisco districts. New York employers were "increasingly willing to negotiate compensation. " And some small business owners in San Francisco reinstated health-care benefits to attract applicants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although retail sales advanced in most regions, unseasonably warm weather dampened clothing purchases in New York and Cleveland, and the strong dollar discouraged international visitors to the Boston, Atlanta and Dallas areas. Auto sales fell in Kansas City and Dallas, but picked up steam in several regions, including Atlanta, St. Louis and Minneapolis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturers, meanwhile, are trying to climb out of a two-year slump caused by a strong dollar -- which makes U. S. exports more expensive -- a weak global economy and the oil sector's troubles. This year, oil prices have risen and the dollar has weakened somewhat, helping stabilize industrial output. Factory activity picked up in the Boston, Philadelphia, Kansas City and Dallas districts. But business fell in Richmond and Atlanta and was "steady to weaker" in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bright spots included transportation-related manufacturing in the Chicago and Dallas regions, and auto and aerospace production in Cleveland. Yet the oil sector's troubles were still hurting demand for related machinery and parts in the Boston, Chicago, St. Louis and Dallas areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market's recovery continued as most districts reported "slight to moderate gains" in sales, though there was a falloff in Kansas City. And while demand for low-priced homes was generally solid, sales of higher-priced units slowed in the New York, Chicago, Dallas and Alaska areas. Limited home supplies crimped sales in the Boston, Philadelphia and Minneapolis districts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A pickup in housing starts could help ease the crunch. Home construction "was generally flat to up," with strong activity in San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while commercial real estate leasing generally improved, reports from the districts pointed to "economic uncertainty surrounding the upcoming presidential elections. "</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN FRANCISCO -- Ever wonder if you're being paid what you're worth?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Glassdoor hopes to take the water cooler guesswork out of that question with Know Your Worth, a new site feature that launched in beta late Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Typing in a series of relevant details -- current title, salary, employer and location -- will trigger an algorithm that creates a graph showcasing what you're making against what the average is for the same position in the field.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, punch in assistant store manager with 11 years experience working in Dallas making $55,000, and Know Your Worth lets you know that a number of your peers are making about $7,000 more a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or a senior software engineer with eight years experience who works at Apple making $160,000 a year would learn that is $10,000 above what is typical, but $15,000 below market value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Almost since we started (in 2008), one of the most popular features of our site was salary data, so we wanted to take that one step further with machine learning and help people see what their value is in today's job market," says Glassdoor corporate affairs chief Dawn Lyon, who also serves as the Mill Valley, Calif-based company's chief advocate on equal pay issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a growing spotlight on the issue of equal pay for the sexes, especially in the technology sector where executives also are grappling with largely white, male staffs that do not reflect the nation's cultural diversity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides being pressured by media outlets and workplace advocates on the morality of employment diversity, a number of studies have indicated that companies with diverse staffs do better financially.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether it's the promise of greater revenues or the desire to do the right thing in order to lure new talent, there is some evidence that the issue isn't being swept under the rug.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> was hit by a lawsuit a year ago by a high-ranking female employee who charged that the tech company's female technical staffers were paid less and promoted less frequently than male peers. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella responded in part by making it his mission to review all salaries for pay inequity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, Amazon said that its review of staff pay revealed that women made 99. 9% of what men earned, findings that came out after Apple said its female employees made 99. 6% of men's salaries. In April, <span class="companylink">Salesforce</span> reported that it had reviewed 16,000 salaries of its female employees and spent $3 million to adjust them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its report on pay inequality, the <span class="companylink">U. S. Congress</span>' Joint Economic Committee published a map that showed pay gaps by state. Delaware rang in on the low end, with women making 10. 4% less than men, while Louisiana featured the largest gap, with men out-earning women by 35%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The same report found that for every white man that earns $55,000, a white woman will make 75% of that sum, an African-American woman 60% and a Hispanic woman 55%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new tool aimed to help fight pay discrimination comes in the form of a law passed this summer in Massachusetts, which now requires employers to state a position's salary up front and makes it illegal to ask what the prospective hire is currently making.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Knowing what you're worth becomes a handy asset in such a blind negotiation, allowing job candidates to position themselves for a salary that is commensurate with the experience of others working in the same field and same market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Obviously for many employees, working somewhere often has to do with the total rewards and culture being offered by a company," says Lyon. "But at least this way you don't have to wait around for that annual compensation discussion to talk about the matter if you feel things are off-base. The number we provide can be a starting point and a catalyst for a conversation. "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lyon says that Glassdoor, which features employment information and listings from 600,000 companies in 190 countries, has been gradually expanding its features. The site now includes not only employee ratings and reviews of companies, but also data on company benefits programs and job candidate interview experience feedback.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By focusing on the nitty-gritty details of pay, which often are shrouded in secrecy, Glassdoor is aiming to take comp talk out of the shadows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Right now, Know Your Worth should be able to provide information for about 60% of U. S. workforce jobs," she says. "But with more people inputting their data, we expect the data to get much more robust and rich. "</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home construction cooled off unexpectedly in September as apartment builders took a step back, according to new figures released Wednesday by the Commerce Department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts tumbled 9% to 1. 047 million in September, down from August's revised rate of 1. 15 million starts. It's also 11. 9% lower from a year earlier. Economists track housing starts closely as a gauge for the housing market's health. The decline was concentrated principally in apartment complexes, which are often volatile. Housing starts on complexes with five or more units fell 38. 9% from a month earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-unit housing starts rose 8. 1% from a month earlier, a positive sign for the market. .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And multifamily housing permits advanced 16. 8%, indicating that the drop in September was likely a blip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Given this, we see the sharp fall in starts in September as unexpected and anomalous," says Barclays economist Blerina Uruci. "We expect to see a rebound in housing starts as the building permits begin to come online. "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits on privately owned housing units broadly rose 6. 3% to 1. 225 million, up from August's rate of 1. 152 million. Permits were up 8. 5% year-over-year. Applications for housing permits is an indicator for future housing activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts were particularly weak in the Northeast and Midwest, where they were down 36% and 14. 1%, respectively.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Inflation report will be scrutinized by Fed on Tuesday</span>
</div><div class="author">Paul Davidson; Paul Davidson </div><div>480 words</div><div>17 October 2016</div><div>USA Today Online</div><div>USATONL</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2016 USA Today Online. Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All rights reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Waiting for inflation to accelerate has been like waiting for Godot -- only it seems even more interminable. Consumer prices, though, have edged up the past year, and Federal Reserve officials are hoping the pace picks up enough to give them some ammunition to raise interest rates by December. A report on the September consumer price index highlights this week's economic news, which also includes data on the housing market and industrial production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturers have been struggling since mid-2014 as a result of the oil sector's downturn and a strong dollar, which makes U. S. goods more expensive overseas. Since January, oil prices have slowly risen and the greenback has weakened and then leveled off, helping factories stage a subdued rebound. But their output has been choppy, with healthy increases in June and July followed by a decline in August. Energy and utilities production has perked up lately. But the forecast for auto manufacturing is soft, and the number of hours worked by factory employees, excluding autos, dropped recently, notes Nomura economist Lewis Alexander. All told, economists expect the Fed on Monday to report a modest 0. 2% rise in industrial production last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low energy prices and a robust dollar also have held down inflation. While that's good for consumers, it's a sign of a sluggish economy and restrained wage gains. And persistently low inflation can lull shoppers into putting off purchases, curtailing economic growth. That's why the Fed would like to see a pickup. The recent rise in oil prices has gradually pulled up overall inflation this year, and a stabilizing dollar has pushed up both that reading and a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items. Gasoline prices rose last month, prompting economists to predict the Labor Department on Tuesday will report a 1. 5% annual increase in headline inflation, up from 1. 1% in August. Core prices, which the Fed monitors more closely, are expected to rise modestly, keeping the annual increase unchanged at 2. 3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market's recovery from the mid-2000s crash has been one of the economy's better storylines. Housing starts fell a steep 5. 8% in August, but that was partly due to storms in the South. Nicer weather in September likely fostered a rebound. Economists reckon the Commerce Department on Wednesday will announce a 2. 9% increase in housing starts to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1. 17 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales have trended up this year but have been constrained by limited inventories, and so sales fell in August for the second straight month. Both Nomura and <span class="companylink">PNC Financial Services Group</span> expect the National Association of Realtors on Thursday to report another modest decline in September to an annual rate of 5. 3 million.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of Los Angeles' history can be explored in the heart of downtown, dating back to its founding in 1781. Within a compact area, you can get a big picture of the city's storied history that includes electric streetcars, cable railroads, flappers and several brushes with Hollywood. Learning about the significant landmarks and architectural styles can turn buildings you might otherwise overlook into noteworthy sites that enrich your visit. The Los Angeles Conservancy highlights many of these during historical walking tours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. One of the most photographed buildings in the city, the Bradbury Building is a national historic landmark and the oldest commercial building in the downtown area. Built in 1893 for gold mining and real estate magnate Lewis Bradbury, the Bradbury Building has an iron and wood interior, with a large skylight that was vital in the days before electricity. Bradbury didn't live to see the completion of his namesake building, finished the year after his death. Today the building is used as office space, and has many of its original elements intact including open-cage elevators, wall sconces and an iron mailbox. The building continues to be a popular filming destination for movie, television and music video sets, including blockbusters such as Blade Runner and 500 Days of Summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2. Designated by the city as a historic-cultural monument, the PacMutual Building was built in 1908 as the new headquarters of The <span class="companylink">Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Company</span>. After an earthquake damaged its home office in San Francisco, the company relocated to Los Angeles where they constructed the Beaux Arts building using terra-cotta and reinforced concrete. The building was meant to conjure feelings of strength, dependability and security to visiting clients purchasing life insurance policies. After exiting a streetcar and entering the PacMutual building, visitors were awed by the grandness of the interior's 14 types of marble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3. Built in 1927, the Hilton Checkers Los Angeles opened as The Mayflower Hotel with sculptures of the Mayflower and Santa Maria ships near the entrance. Its Spanish-style exterior is not the building's most defining characteristic; rather it is the narrowness of the hotel, which was built on a lot only 60 feet wide by 160 feet long. Its opening night party remains notorious in L. A. lore: The Mayflower brought in starlets dressed in capes who engaged in low conversation over sedate music until the band broke into lively Charleston music -- at which time the starlets ripped off their capes to reveal flapper costumes and began dancing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4. The Los Angeles Central Library building has classic Art Deco-style architecture that draws the eye toward the sky with geometric shapes and a tall tower encasing a pyramid. Opened in 1926, the library extends for an entire city block. Suffering damage from the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake and two arson fires the previous year that ruined 30% of the library's collection, Central Library was in danger of being torn down by the city. A group of local citizens formed to stop destruction of the historic building, which needed $125 million in repairs. When a real estate developer said he would pay for the repairs as long as he could have air rights to the land, the city obliged, reopening the restored library in 1993.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">5. Another Art Deco building, One Bunker Hill was constructed in 1931 to house the <span class="companylink">Southern California Edison Company</span> that supplied electricity to all of Los Angeles. Resembling a cathedral, the building has 22 kinds of marble inside, along with coffered ceilings, burled walnut elevators, and many geometric shapes. The lobby features murals by artist Hugo Ballin, who at one time was also a major player in Hollywood's silent film industry. Now an office to <span class="companylink">Torrey Pines Bank</span> and other businesses, the building was one of the first electrically heated and cooled buildings on the West Coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">6. As the shortest railway in the world, Angels Flight Railway was built in 1900 as part of the fashionable Bunker Hill neighborhood. The funicular's two cars shuttled passengers up and down the steep hill between the top of Bunker Hill and the downtown area, for a total of 298 feet. Service was suspended in 2013, when a one-way ride still cost only 50 cents. The railway's board of directors is currently working to resolve regulatory issues to reopen Angels Flight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">7. Bunker Hill residents used Angels Flight Railway to get down the hill to Grand Central Market to shop for groceries. The open-air market was the city's first fireproofed and steel-reinforced structure, opened in 1917. Merchants and goods sold in the market have evolved with the times, from butchers and Jewish delis to today's ramen and ceviche. Renovated in the early 1990s as part of the revitalization of Grand Central Square, the market was purchased by urban developer Ira Yellin. His wife Adele has continued to oversee the project since Ira's death. The 30,000-square-foot marketplace is open daily and has nearly 100 vendors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">8. Named in honor of Army General John Pershing, Pershing Square is a popular public park originally settled as "La Plaza Abajo" in 1781 by Mexicans who established a pueblo on Olvera Street. The public square's close proximity to the river made it an ideal venue for community activities. Later, an underground parking structure was added in 1951, modeled after San Francisco's Union Square. Most recently renovated in 1994, the park that covers one square block is rumored to have a reconfiguration forthcoming.</p>

The funicular's two cars shuttled passengers up and down the steep hill between the top of Bunker Hill and the downtown area, for a total of 298 feet. Service was suspended in 2013, when a one-way ride still cost only 50 cents. The railway's board of directors is currently working to resolve regulatory issues to reopen Angels Flight.</p>

Later, an underground parking structure was added in 1951, modeled after San Francisco's Union Square.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve took a pass on raising interest rates last week but -- noting the economy is picking up after a sluggish first half of the year -- said it expects to act by December, assuming the data hold up. Now it's up to the economy to cooperate, starting with a flurry of reports this week that include new-home sales, consumer spending and business investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales have been a standout in a recovering housing market. Newly constructed dwellings were sold at a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 654,000 in July, the strongest since late 2007. Steady housing starts should keep sales flowing, but the market likely needed a breather in August, says Nomura economist Lewis Alexander. Economists estimate the Commerce Department will announce Monday that new-home sales fell 9. 2% last month to a still-solid annual pace of 594,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has been buoyed, in part, by rising consumer confidence. In August, Americans' perceptions of the economy and labor market surged to a confidence reading of 101. 1, the highest in nearly a year, largely because of generally strong job growth in recent months. But the government announced that payroll gains slowed in August and stocks were down in mid-September before a recent rally. Economists expect the Conference Board to report Tuesday that its September confidence reading sagged to a still-respectable 98. 7.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business investment has been the economy's big laggard as low oil prices curtailed energy-related projects and a strong dollar clobbered manufacturers' exports. But in June and July, capital goods orders excluding aircraft and defense -- a proxy for business capital spending -- recorded its first back-to-back increase since early 2015. A partial rebound in oil prices and a weakening dollar are helping stabilize industrial production and company outlays. But uncertainty over the presidential election is likely still making businesses cautious. Economists expect Commerce to report Wednesday that so-called core capital goods orders dipped 0. 1% in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government looks further back in the rearview mirror on Thursday with its third, and final, estimate of economic growth in the second quarter. Its last tally had the economy expanding by a meager 1. 1% annual rate in the April-June period, its third straight weak quarter. Alexander expects upward revisions to consumer spending and commercial construction to be offset by downward adjustments to software investment, housing construction and trade. Overall, economists expect Commerce to revise up its estimate of second-quarter growth to a still-sluggish 1. 4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer spending has been on a nice run amid solid job growth and low gasoline prices. But retail sales fell sharply in August, even while spending on services likely picked up. All told, economists expect Commerce on Friday to report a modest 0. 2% rise in personal spending last month.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some relief may be in sight for a housing crunch that's been driving up home prices and crimping sales across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing inventories rose in the third quarter from a year ago in 21 of the 100 largest markets, according to real estate research firm <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>. Although small changes in the figures can represent normal volatility, six metro areas recorded annual increases of more than 20% -- Fort Myers, Fla. ; Miami: Las Vegas; Fresno, Calif. ; Sarasota, Fla; and Oklahoma City -- up from two in the second quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the markets are in the so-called "sand states" of Florida, California and Nevada, which experienced some of the biggest price declines in the real estate crash but also have led the recovery in recent years. As a result, their housing stocks dwindled, but are now being replenished.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"My belief is this is the start of a turnaround in inventory in the U. S. ," says Trulia Chief Economist Ralph McLaughlin. He noted, however, that it could take six months to a year before a shift is evident in a significant part of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, housing inventories fell 10. 1% to a 4. 6 month supply in August from a 5. 1-month supply a year ago, the National Association of Realtors said last week (week ending 9/24). That was the lowest August stockpile since 2004, says NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yun blamed the shortage for his group's announcement that existing home sales fell in August for the second straight month to the second-lowest level of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides leaving fewer homes on the market for buyers, the crunch discourages sales by pushing up prices. The median existing home price was $240,200 in August, up 5. 1% the past 12 months, the Realtors group said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike NAR, <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> includes newly-built homes in its inventory totals. They represent just 10% of supplies but increased construction is likely helping to beef up skimpy selections in certain markets, McLaughlin says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet McLaughlin mostly attributed the rising inventories in some areas to an increase in existing homes. Investors who scooped up units on the cheap after the real estate crash are putting them up for sale in greater numbers, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, price gains are providing positive equity to homeowners who had owed more on their mortgages than their homes were worth after the crash. That's coaxing many to sell. In the second quarter, 11. 9% of homeowners nationwide were "seriously underwater," down from 13. 3% a year ago and 29% in 2012, according to RealtyTrac.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing inventories in the San Francisco area are up 19. 3% compared to a year ago, <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> figures show. Largely as a result, the region's home prices in June were up 6. 4% annually, down from 11. 1% in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The area has seen a flurry of new condo construction recently as well as an increase in existing home supplies, says real estate agent Gabrielle Bunker of Coldwell Banker. She's seeing fewer multiple offers for homes and far fewer buyers bidding more than market price.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The summer has been a hot one for real estate, and the trend toward a strong seller's market was underscored Thursday as the National Association of Realtors released its latest existing-home sales figures. Sales were down 0. 9% in August, but not for lack of buyer enthusiasm. Instead, it's because inventory is drastically low. With fewer sellers out there, price pressure is on the rise. The median sales price was up 5. 1% from last year. Steve Udelson, president of Owners. com, a top 10 national real estate brokerage, gives his take on the home front.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: What kind of home inventory are we seeing going into fall?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: We anticipate that consumer demand for homes will remain strong and we will see continued limitations on both existing inventory, starter homes and new construction. Low inventory is a major driver of price inflation, so we can anticipate that median home sales prices will also continue to be on the higher end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: What does that mean for buyers?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: Because of limited housing inventory and historically low interest rates, we can still expect to see hot competition among buyers. It's very much still a seller's market in many regions. That's why it's critical for buyers keep their budget in mind, but also to be careful that they don't underbid, because they could easily lose out on a heavily sought-after home. Since there are fewer options to purchase a home right now, the caution for home buyers is that they may need to move fast to close the deal, but could end up paying more than they might have anticipated or wanted. That's why it's crucial for buyers to do their homework to fully understand the value of the home so they can feel confident about their purchase decision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: How should buyers approach negotiations during this time?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: The more the potential buyer knows about why the seller is moving, the better. For example, if the seller has already purchased another home and they are paying two mortgages, they may be more inclined to negotiate costs to move the process along faster. Buyers also shouldn't assume that the home inspection will allow them to reopen negotiations. Having a sense of what upgrades the home might need, like a new roof or water heater, can be great to help negotiate costs upfront instead of waiting until the inspection time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: The Fed has pointed to "economic uncertainty surrounding the November elections" as one factor for a cooler market. What would you say to people putting off a home purchase (or sale) because of the election?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: There is always uncertainty leading up to an election, and it can cause both buyers and sellers to hold off on making any real estate decisions at all. But usually, election-related uncertainty is not the sole reason someone would delay buying or selling a home. Homebuyers shouldn't lose sight that it's a very good time to capitalize on low interest rates. For sellers, prices are nearing their pre-housing meltdown highs again. There may be some short-term economic shifts because of the election, but if you're in the market to buy or sell right now, it's not a reason to wait. If you need a mortgage, take action now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: What's one tip you wish buyers would take to heart?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: The best tip I can give to buyers is that with home prices at their current elevated levels, focus on finding smart ways to save. Savvy buyers will take advantage of tech-enabled brokerage services that offer reduced commissions or buyer's rebates. Looking at "for sale by owner" properties or considering buying a home at auction are strategic options. Taking advantage of low interest rates so you can lock in a manageable mortgage is an obvious tip. Buyers should shop around carefully and get as informed as they possibly can about the areas where they're looking to buy, because understanding local market dynamics can help while negotiating.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week's Federal Reserve meeting isn't exactly brimming with drama -- policymakers are not expected to raise interest rates -- but there's at least a dollop of tension after healthy job growth in recent months strengthened the case for a move. That's more than can be said for other Fed gatherings this year, when a rate hike was out of the question. The Fed decision highlights a light week of economic news that also includes key reports on housing, one of the economy's bright spots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts strengthened in June and July after a patchy start to the year. The activity largely has been driven by multifamily construction as many Millennials gravitate toward downtown living, where apartments proliferate, while others rent because they've struggled to qualify for mortgages. But activity likely pulled back after two strong months, and stormy weather in the South may have further restrained the region's builders, says Nomura economist Lewis Alexander. Economists expect the Commerce Department on Tuesday to report a 1. 5% drop in housing starts last month to a still-solid seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1. 19 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Fed rate increase appeared to at least have a 50% chance after blockbuster job gains in June and July stoked speculation that faster inflation can't be too far behind. But payroll additions were disappointing in August and growth in service-sector activity for the month fell to the lowest level since 2010. Inflation, meanwhile, generally remains tame. And while the speeches of Fed Chair Janet Yellen and other policymakers have been somewhat ambiguous, the most recent comments of Fed officials have emphasized caution in light of the risk of derailing a still-fragile recovery. What's more, the Fed has shied away from hiking rates when investors don't expect it for fear of generating market turbulence that could further rock the economy. The Fed has stood pat since lifting its key rate in December for the first time in nine years. Economists expect more of the same when the Fed releases its statement on Wednesday after a two-day meeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While housing starts may be due for a breather, existing home sales are on the opposite side of the seesaw. Sales fell sharply in July, largely because supplies remain tight, and that's driving up prices. But pending home sales and mortgage applications both moved higher earlier in the summer, likely foreshadowing a pickup in closings, Alexander says. Economists estimate the National Association of Realtors on Thursday will announce a 1. 1% rise in existing home sales to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5. 5 million.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A scarcity of affordable homes on the market helped drag down existing homes sales in July as low inventory levels and higher prices put an end to a four-month climb. Existing home sales fell 3. 2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5. 39 million from a revised 5. 57 million in June, according to the National Association of Realtors. That includes transactions of single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Severely restrained inventory and the tightening grip it's putting on affordability is the primary culprit for the considerable sales slump throughout much of the country last month," said Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing homes for sale ticked up 0. 9% from a month ago to 2. 13 million homes, but is still down 5. 8% from a year ago. That's the 14th straight month of year-over-year decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the median sale price showed no sign of cooling down. It climbed 5. 3% to $244,100 from a year ago, the 53rd straight month of year-over-year growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Realtors are reporting diminished buyer traffic because of the scarce number of affordable homes on the market," Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Transactions of single-family homes slipped 2% from last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4. 82 million and is 0. 8% below a year ago. Sales of multi-family houses, including condominium and co-ops, declined 12. 3% to 570,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The West was the only region that posted sales growth, rising 2. 5% to an annual rate of 1. 23 million, yet still slightly below a year ago. Existing home sales in the South, Midwest and Northeast all decreased.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales surged in July to the highest level in almost nine years as strong demand amid low interest rates and low existing inventory helped boost the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new single-family homes jumped 12.4% from June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 654,000, the highest level since October 2007. Sales were 31.3% above their showing a year ago, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes were sold at a median price of $294,600 in July, and the average price was $355,800.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While new-home sales figures are usually volatile, the July report is a rare case, said Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The year-over-year change is statistically significant, indicating the surge in sales can be taken with more than just a grain of salt," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of new homes fell for a second month in a row to a supply of 4.3 months at the current sales pace. Inventory of existing homes slipped in June to 4.6 months from May. A supply of six months is considered the benchmark for a balanced market. The shrinking supply shows solid demand, McLaughlin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the South, the largest market among the four regions tracked by the Census, transactions on new homes grew 18.1%. The Northeast grew 40% and the Midwest saw a 1.2% rise. Sales in the West were flat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Houses priced from $200,000 to $399,999 remain the bulk of total sales, while transactions of homes with a price tag below $150,000 or higher than $750,000 increased from June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With strong demand, persisting high sales and low inventory, price hikes could be on the way if homebuilders don't up their production, said Matthew Pointon, property economist at Capital Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The fact housing starts have stalled of late is therefore something of a concern, but we suspect activity will pick up soon as builders shift their focus towards lower-priced/higher volume single- family starter homes," he said, adding "the delay between housing starts and completions suggests conditions in the new-home sector will remain tight for a few months yet."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen will speak on Friday about the central bank's long-term policy framework. Before then, reports on home sales, orders of long-lasting goods and the U. S. trade balance will hold the spotlight in this week's economic news.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yellen will deliver the keynote speech, titled "Designing Resilient Monetary Policy Frameworks for the Future," at the <span class="companylink">Kansas City Fed</span>'s two-day Monetary Policy Symposium at Jackson Hole, Wyo. , on Friday. Investors will tune in closely to gauge the likelihood of an interest rate hike as the Fed -- cautious about global markets and the job market previously in a slump -- has yet to raise short-term rates this year. The July meeting minutes show, however, that a rate increase "was or would soon be warranted. "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An update on new-home sales will lead the way Tuesday, with existing-home sales following on Wednesday to complete a snapshot of the housing sector in July. High demand has heated up sales and transaction prices in recent months, while a shortage of labor and land has slowed supply from catching up. Nomura Global Economics expects a decline in both annualized rates, according to a research report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">News of durable goods will be revealed on Thursday, pointing to how busy factories could be in coming months. Previously, June's orders of long-lasting equipment posted the largest slip in two years, as military aircraft orders tumbled 30%. However, a proxy for business investment -- excluding the volatile aircraft and defense orders -- actually edged up. Stronger recent data on industrial production of most durable goods and new orders in the manufacturing sector suggest durable goods orders might have rebounded in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, the Census Bureau is releasing an advance report on the U. S. trade balance. Exports of industrial supplies and cars slowed in June, but that was offset by an increase in shipments of food and beverages and consumer goods. Nomura expects a narrower deficit in July as data on shipping containers and trade prices suggest higher exports and lower imports.</p>

</div><div class="author">Mary Troyan; Mary Troyan </div><div>759 words</div><div>17 August 2016</div><div>USA Today Online</div><div>USATONL</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2016 USA Today Online. Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All rights reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Rep. Mark Meadows' chief of staff resigned after female employees accused him of inappropriate behavior but remained on the House payroll in violation of House rules, according to an independent investigation now under review by the House Ethics Committee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meadows, a North Carolina Republican running for a third term in Congress, paid former chief of staff Kenny West $58,125 from April 2015 to August 2015 even though he was no longer working in Meadows' office, according to the Office of Congressional Ethics, which investigated the allegations and reported its findings to the House Ethics Committee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The House Ethics Committee released the investigative report Wednesday, as required by House rules. The disclosure "does not itself indicate that any violation has occurred or reflect any judgment on behalf of the committee," according to a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the OCE's report, including transcripts of witness interviews and personnel records, is a startling window into the management of Meadows' office and how he handled multiple complaints from women on his staff about West's behavior. After some internal confusion about whether West was still employed, Meadows eventually hired a new chief of staff but changed West's title and filed paperwork to allow him to continue to draw a paycheck for several more months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is "substantial reason to believe that Representative Meadows retained an employee who did not perform duties commensurate with the compensation the employee received and certified that the compensation met applicable House standards, in violation of House rules and standards of conduct," the OCE report concludes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a letter to the Ethics Committee from Meadows' attorney, dated May 10, Meadows denies wrongdoing and said he continued to pay West "to ensure a smooth transition of his official responsibilities. "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was his belief that these severance payments were consistent with House rules and practice," the letter states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OCE investigators, however, said they found no records indicating Meadows was seeking a lump sum bonus or severance for West in 2015, just salary as a senior adviser.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meadows also declined to participate in the OCE's investigation of the case and instead "self-reported in November 2015" the allegations directly to the Ethics Committee. As a result, OCE, which is a nonpartisan office that reviews allegations of misconduct by House members, considered Meadows and others in his office "non-cooperative witnesses. "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problems in Meadows' office surfaced in October 2014 when a group of employees reported to the deputy chief of staff "they were uncomfortable with Mr. West's inappropriate behavior towards them," the OCE reported. Meadows asked the chief of staff to Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S. C. , to interview the female employees, and Meadows eventually "took actions to limit or prohibit Kenny West's presence in the Washington DC and district offices," the report states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But staff said West remained involved in operations through email and phone calls through late 2014 and early 2015. An April 1, 2015, email from Meadows to his staff announced plans to hire someone to replace West, and a new chief of staff started later that summer. House payroll records show West's title was changed to senior adviser on April 1 -- despite comments from Meadows to his staff that West was no longer with the office -- and he was considered terminated Aug. 15. During that time, he was paid $58,125.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The witnesses who were interviewed by OCE are not named in the transcripts, but they formerly worked on Meadows' staff. They said women in the office were uncomfortable around West based on his comments, his attempts to talk to them alone and how he touched them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It kind of was first brought to my attention when I was brought on board and I was told, 'Hey, by the way, you probably don't want to wear your hair in a ponytail when Kenny's in town, because he really likes to play with girls' hair when it's a ponytail for some reason, and he seems to touch girls' hair a lot, so by the way, don't do that,'" one witness told OCE.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The OCE report is focused solely on whether Meadows violated the rules of the House by paying West for not working, and not the sexual harassment claims against West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Depending on its findings, the House Ethics Committee has various levels of punishment it can impose on a member, such as a reprimand or censure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meadows and West could not immediately be reached for comment Wednesday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer prices cooled in July as the cost for gasoline fell sharply, helping to keep inflation in check. The consumer price index, which measures prices paid by Americans for major consumer items, was unchanged on a seasonally adjusted basis, the Labor Department said Tuesday. Excluding food and energy prices, which are considered more volatile, consumer prices rose 0.1% in July, the smallest increase since March. Total energy costs fell 1.6% as the cost of all types of gasoline tumbled 4.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts were especially hot in July</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts posted a robust July as home builders strive to catch up with strong demand. Housing starts rose 2.1% from June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.21 million, its highest level since February 2016 and second highest since October 2007. Single- family housing starts rose 0.5% to 770,000, but multifamily units of five or more showed greater strength, jumping 8.3% to 433,000.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts posted a robust gain in July and building permits dipped slightly but stayed at a healthy level as home builders strive to catch up with strong demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Privately-owned housing starts rose 2. 1% from June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1. 21 million, its highest level since February 2016 and the second highest level since October 2007, when housing starts hit 1. 26 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new construction figure has been seesawing within a narrow band of 150,000 since April 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits ticked down 0. 1% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1. 15 million, ending a three-month hike prior.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family housing starts rose 0. 5% to 770,000, while permits fell 3. 7%. But multi-family housing units of 5 or more showed even greater strength, jumping 8. 3% to 433,000 and permits rising 6. 5%. Regionally, the Northeast pumped up overall new construction with a 15. 5% increase, also largely of multi-family homes. The Midwest's 10. 5% growth in building permits led the nation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising home sales and prices have shown a steady growth in the housing market in recent months. People have accumulated some equity since the recession to trade up or downsize, but a lack of labor and land have slowed deliveries of new homes to meet the increased demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Supply-constrained homebuyers should rest assured that relief is on the way," said Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>, citing the 12-month rolling total of new constructions, a less volatile measure, rose 8. 5% year-over-year in July to 1,15 million, the most since May 2008.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U. S. stocks cooled off Tuesday as all three major indexes pulled back from record highs and closed lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop came despite encouraging signs for the housing sector and as inflation continues to remain low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones industrial average fell 84. 03 points, or 0. 5%, to close at 18,522. 02. The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500 index slumped 12. 00 points, or 0. 6%, to 2178. 15 and the Nasdaq composite index declined 34. 90, or 0. 7%, to 5227. 11.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All three indexes had closed at record highs Monday as traders have been piling into U. S. stocks, which now make up the highest percentage of investors' portfolios since January 2015, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors took a pause from their recent streak of ebullience as they await for Wednesday's release of the minutes from the latest Federal Reserve meeting that will offer clues on the trajectory of U. S. interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In economic developments Tuesday, U. S. housing starts rose 2. 1% from June to July, according to the <span class="companylink">U. S.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve last month appeared to leave the door open to a September interest rate hike, but it was characteristically cryptic in its post-meeting statement. Minutes of its July meeting, slated for release this week, could shed more light on the chances the Fed will lift its key rate for the first time this year. The week's economic news also features reports on housing starts, inflation and industrial production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts have steadily picked up, fueled by a low supply of existing homes and solid job and income growth. But starts rose a substantial 4. 8% in June and "some near-term payback" is likely in July, says Nomura economist Lewis Alexander. Economists expect the Commerce Department to report Tuesday that housing starts dipped 1. 1% last month to a still-healthy seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1. 18 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, the Labor Department releases its inflation reading for July. Low gasoline prices have kept consumer price increases well below the Fed's target, and pump prices fell last month after generally moving up the first half of the year. But core inflation, which the Fed monitors more closely and excludes volatile food and energy costs, has been climbing gradually. Further increases, along with other signs of an improved economic outlook, could give the Fed enough ammunition to boost interest rates in coming months. Economists estimate headline inflation was unchanged in July but core prices increased a moderate 0. 2%, keeping the annual increase at a solid 2. 3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industrial production has been weak for nearly two years because of a sluggish global economy and strong dollar that have clobbered exports, and an oil industry slump that has stifled drilling and related demand for steel pipes. But the dollar broadly has weakened this year while oil prices have risen, raising hopes that the sector is stabilizing. Factory output increased sharply in June on strong auto production. And economist Stuart Hoffman of <span class="companylink">PNC Financial Services Group</span>, says, "The manufacturing slowdown has ended. " That proclamation will be tested as soon as this week. Economists expect the Fed to report a modest 0. 2% rise in July industrial production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main course for economy watchers comes Wednesday, with the release of minutes of the Fed's July 26-27 meeting. Its post-meeting statement was unexpectedly bullish after booming June job gains offset weak May numbers and the market sell-off unleashed by the United Kingdom's Brexit vote had more than reversed. The Fed said "near-term risks to the economic outlook diminished," stoking speculation that it could lift interest rates as soon as September. But the Fed gave no clear signal, and economic growth has been feeble for three quarters. The minutes could offer clues on the odds of a September move.</p>

</div><div class="author">Deborah Kearns; Deborah Kearns </div><div>606 words</div><div>15 August 2016</div><div>USA Today Online</div><div>USATONL</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2016 USA Today Online. Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All rights reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Imagine you've gotten the keys to your new house and you've moved in. You're on a homebuyer's high -- until you discover a leaking roof or a snake infestation (true story). What do you do?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are some ways to avoid a costly post-closing catastrophe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. Look at the listing language. Some properties are listed for sale "as is," but you should clarify if that means the seller is absolutely unwilling to address major safety issues that might come up in an inspection that would make it difficult for them to sell the house to any buyer, says Liane Jameson, a real estate broker in St. Petersburg, Fla. If a seller either can't afford or doesn't want to fork out any money for repairs, be prepared to move on, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2. Know your lender's requirements. Some mortgage lenders require that certain safety issues, such as high radon levels a decayed roof or dangerous structural defects, be addressed before they'll give you a loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3. Check out the property and seller online. If you find a house that's been renovated recently, check your county's records to see if the proper building permits were pulled, says Kris Paolini, a real estate agent in Rockville, Md. You want to make sure that major renovations are up to code.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4. Get a home inspection. When you buy a house, even new construction, always hire your own inspector to do a thorough home inspection, which typically costs $300 to $500, Paolini says. While an inspector might not catch everything, particularly if a seller is hiding something intentionally, you shouldn't skip this step -- problems that pop up later could cost you big bucks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">5. Review the seller's disclosures. Laws vary from state to state, but generally sellers are supposed to reveal any "latent defects" -- problems with their property that a standard inspection can't reasonably be expected to reveal, says Maryland real estate attorney Robert Moses. Homebuyers should always ask for repair or renovation documentation. Also, be wary of sellers who disclaim knowledge of the home's condition; that's a red flag, Moses says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you've moved into a home and find major problems that weren't disclosed, you typically have two options: arbitration -- mandatory or voluntary, depending on your state -- or a lawsuit, Moses says. In arbitration, all parties will sit down to discuss the issue and try to come to a resolution. If that doesn't work, suing the seller, and possibly the seller's agent, would be your next move. Litigation, however, isn't a silver bullet; it can cost thousands of dollars and take months to resolve, Moses says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FYI FOR HOMEOWNERS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're selling your home, you have a legal and ethical responsibility to disclose any non-visible defects before you put your home on the market. These might include:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Damaged roof, subfloor or walls. Outdated electrical or plumbing systems. Structural damage from flood, fire, wind, expansive soils or water. Broken appliances. Problems with major home systems (HVAC, furnace, water heater). Structural or foundation cracks from settling.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">London tops the list of most-common workplace destinations for American expats, a new LinkedIn study shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sydney is second, followed by Toronto, Paris and Shanghai, according to the professional social-networking site, which surveyed 25,000 members who have worked abroad after 2010 for professional experiences longer than summer jobs or student internships.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">London is "the indisputable leader of the pack," the study says. Some 18% of all international assignments are concentrated in London, according to the study.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most common small hometown of American expats was Bloomington, Ind. , followed by Urbana-Champaign, Ill. and Santa Barbara, Calif. Among mid-size cities, the most common hometown was Tucson, Ariz.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest group of American expats work as language instructors, teachers or translators. Sales managers and marketers are also popular occupations abroad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of major American cities, Washington D. C. produced the most expats. New York City was second.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Globalization makes it more 'normal' for professionals to migrate," said LinkedIn economist Guy Berger in an email. "Additionally, in recent years, business cycles across the world have been out of sync -- so when there's a dearth of jobs at home, there may simultaneously be a boom of opportunities abroad. "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">London has more than 80,000 job openings, the study shows, while Paris has posted 45,000 and Tokyo more than 40,000.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U. S. home prices grew modestly in May but annual gains continued to flatten.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Standard &amp; Poor's/Case-Shiller U. S. National Home Price Index posted Tuesday 5% annual growth in May, the same as in April. It marked the fourth straight month of flat or falling home prices on an annual basis after a long string of increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is a sign that the U. S. housing market may be cooling in the wake of double digit price appreciation between 2012 and 2014," said Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist of real estate research firm Trulia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in S&amp;P Case Shiller's index of 20 large cities increased 5. 2% compared to a year ago, down from a downwardly revised 5. 4% in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Portland, Ore. , Seattle and Denver continued their lead among the 20 cities, while former front runners such as San Diego, San Francisco and Los Angeles lost some steam, said David Blitzer, chairman of the Index Committee at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The two hottest areas during the housing boom were Florida and the Southwest. Miami and Tampa have recovered in the last few months while Las Vegas and Phoenix remain weak," he said, adding that home prices recovered early on in New York City and Washington, D. C. , but "now both are among the weakest areas in the country. "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, new single-home sales jumped 3. 5% in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 592,000, the Census Bureau said. That beat the 562,000 that economists polled by Bloomberg had forecast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales also maintained robust growth, according to a report last week, climbing to a nine-year high of 5. 57 million in June.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bolstered by first-time home buyers, existing-home sales rose for the fourth straight month in June, reaching a nine-year high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops increased 1. 1% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5. 57 million, up from May's downwardly revised 5. 51 million, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. The June pace was the strongest since 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time buyers made up 33% of those transactions, the biggest share in four years. That eased concerns that a shortage of affordable houses has been pushing entry-level buyers out of the market. The median existing-home price also reached a new high as it surged 4. 8% to $247,700 from a year ago, above the former peak of $238,900 in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">June's sales exceeded the highest forecast of economists polled by Bloomberg, 5. 56 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Healthy job gains, record-high stock prices and near-record low mortgage rates stoked June's positive showings, said Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The modest bump in June sales to first-time buyers can be attributed to mortgage rates near all-time lows and perhaps a hopeful indication that more affordable, lower-priced homes are beginning to make their way onto the market," he said. "The odds of closing on a home are definitely higher right now for first-time buyers living in metro areas with tamer price growth and greater entry-level supply -- particularly areas in the Midwest and parts of the South. "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Midwest has the lowest median existing-home price among all regions, $199,900, followed by the South, at $217,400. The median price in the West climbed 7. 2% from a year ago to $350,800.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total available existing homes for sale dipped 0. 9% to 2. 12 million, now 5. 8% below a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Seasonally adjusted, the month's supply of homes in June 2016 was the lowest since June 2005, indicating that inventory problems still plague home buyers," said Ralph McLaughlin, <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>'s chief economist.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts and building permits improved modestly in June, as the housing market continued a steady recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home construction jumped 4. 8% in June to a seasonally adjusted rate of 1. 189 million, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. That's above the 1. 17 million consensus of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The May reading dipped after April's 4. 9% leap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits increased 1. 5 % to 1. 15 million, heralding future gains in starts. Single-family permits gained 1% to 738,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family housing starts rose 4. 4% above the revised May rate to 778,000. New construction of multi-family homes rose 5% to 411,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As home prices and sales both grew at solid paces in recent months, some economists blamed restrictive zoning for tempering the gains. But a new study by research firm <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> concludes that local delays in building permit approvals are the real obstacle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although housing starts and building permits posted upbeat readings in June, the less volatile quarterly numbers weren't as favorable, said Patrick Newport, economist at IHS Global Insight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Permits fell for the second quarter in a row, although housing starts eked out small gains in both quarters," he said. "As a result, residential investment in the second quarter will likely be a drag on GDP growth for the first time in nine quarters. "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The single-family housing market is in a slump, he said, as starts dropped 3. 5% in the second quarter. But strong pent-up demand should ease concerns, the economist added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Given that second-quarter new home sales are on track for having their best quarter in eight years, single-family housing permits will likely pick up soon. "</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The turmoil roiling the United Kingdom real estate market since the surprise Brexit outcome is unlikely to trigger similar impact for the U.S. real estate sector, industry experts predict.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, some predict U.K pain ultimately could mean U.S. gain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The June 23 referendum in favor of breaking ties with the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> has raised uncertainty about some U.K real estate prices. <span class="companylink">UBS</span> analysts tentatively project commercial property values could fall 20% for London offices, 15% for U.K. retail and 5% to 10% for London retail and U.K. industrial locations, FTAlphaville reported Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Brexit fallout also prompted a wave of redemption requests at U.K. property funds. Unable to sell properties immediately to raise cash, at least six of the funds blocked retail investors from withdrawing their money amid a wave of redemption requests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decisions represent a nearly one-month lock on an estimated $12billion in U.K. commercial real estate investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's no indication of anything like that happening in the U.S.," said Jim Costello, senior vice president of Real Capital Analytics, a data firm focused on commercial real estate investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, sovereign wealth funds and other large institutional funds that were drawn to London real estate investments may now shift some of that capital to properties in the U.S. market, said Costello.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The fundamentals of U.S. real estate are positive," said Cedrik Lachance, director of U.S. REIT research at <span class="companylink">Green Street Advisors</span>, a California-based real estate research firm. "That seems unchanged to us."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An average publicly traded U.S. real estate investment trust (REIT) has outperformed the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500 index by approximately 2.5% since the Brexit vote, Lachance said. However a group of roughly 10 U.S. REITs with more exposure to Europe in general have underperformed their peers, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As U.K. property investors reconsider their holdings, publicly traded U.S. REITs "could be one of the beneficiaries" in the long term, said Michael Grupe, of the <span class="companylink">National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investor uncertainty about the global economy, partly driven by the Brexit outcome, has driven down <span class="companylink">U.S. Treasury</span> yields to record lows. In turn, that has sent mortgage rates toward record lows too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 30-year fixed rate mortgage averaged 3.41% for the week ending July 7, down from the 3.48% average a week earlier and 4.04% lower than the average for the same time last year, mortgage giant <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> reported Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lower rates "could provide a boost for lower-income U.S. buyers" hoping to enter the real estate market, said Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Uncertainty over the London real estate market could prompt U.S. and overseas companies with offices in the British financial center to shift those offices to the U.S., further boosting the domestic real estate sector, said Yun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, Yun and other U.S. real estate experts see a few potential weak areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> data show that U.K. buyers accounted for $1.6 billion in April 2015-March 2016 residential housing purchases in Florida, which has a large vacation home market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The post-Brexit decline of the British pound relative to the U.S. dollar could dry up similar sales for the immediate future, Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors have already battered the stocks of U.S.-based real estate services giants <span class="companylink">CBRE Group</span> and <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> amid the Brexit fallout. Both have significant U.K. business operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2.5%</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hillary Clinton unveiled a plan Wednesday to give grads saddled with piles of student debt a break on their payments and to give future students an even bigger break: free tuition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clinton's "New College Compact" would initially offer free in- state tuition to students from families with incomes up to $85,000, and later to students with family incomes of up to $125,000. In addition, it would offer a three-month hiatus on the repayment of federal student loans to allow for time to refinance debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"American families are drowning in debt caused by ever-rising college costs," Clinton said in a statement Wednesday. Her plan aims to make sure that "working families can send a child or loved one to college."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cost of this plan? About $350 billion over 10 years, according to Clinton's briefing materials, which would be paid by closing loopholes for high-income taxpayers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While a free education probably sounds like a dream to prospective students, some experts say it could have unexpected ramifications. For one, students might put less of a value on their education themselves and thus may slack off, said Jon Baumunk, a lecturer at the Charles W. Lamden School of Accountancy at <span class="companylink">San Diego State University</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I believe there should be some sort of accountability, such as the free tuition being given in return for classroom performance," Baumunk said. "I would propose that a minimum GPA and a minimum class attendance requirement be put on the table for discussion."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another problem with free tuition is that it could end up raising the price of college, according to Alex Chediak, author of Beating the College Debt Trap: Getting a Degree Without Going Broke. Colleges would have fewer incentives to keep their costs in check if the government is picking up the tab. "Schools would be more likely to ignore rising costs because they're assured a strong customer base" considering that, according to Clinton's campaign, more than 80% of American families would qualify.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As far as the plan to help grads refinance their debts, it also has a potential to backfire, because it could help current borrowers only if they could refinance to lower interest rates. "If the refinancing terms merely lower monthly payments by extending the years of repayment (which drives up the total cost), then it could hurt current borrowers," Chediak said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it comes to the pros to Clinton's plan, aside from opening college to a wave of new students, it could help stimulate the economy. On average, this year's college grads have just over $37,000 in student debt each, reports Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of Cappex.com. Lowering the total cost of that debt could help not only the students, it could help new businesses grow and home sales to strengthen, says Jamie Hopkins, professor at <span class="companylink">the American College of Financial Services</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The burden of student loan debt limits the ability of young people to start businesses and take financial risks that may pay off later," Hopkins said. "As debt mounts, borrowers put off home ownership and feel trapped by their obligations."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chediak said the solution to the student debt crisis goes beyond student loans and tuition to personal responsibility. Students must shop for value when choosing a college, and select majors with reasonable job prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Loan-forgiveness programs, in addition to the price tag for Uncle Sam, do not create an incentive for future college students to pursue marketable fields," he said. "We need to cultivate families and students to make wise decisions from the get-go: taking on less debt and developing marketable skills so they can command higher earnings."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CLINTON'S COLLEGE PLAN BASICS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Free in-state tuition for public universities -- initially for families with incomes of up to $85,000, later for families that make $125,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A three-month hiatus on collecting federal student loan payments. This would give borrowers time to refinance or restructure their debt on more favorable terms.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family home prices notched at least a 5% annual rise tor the sixth consecutive month in April, but growth is slowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Standard &amp; Poor's/Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index showed home prices increased 5% in April compared to a year ago, down from a revised 5.1% rise in March. That marks the third consecutive slowdown in annual price appreciation, which topped out at 5.4% in January. Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist of research firm Trulia, says the recent trend likely signifies a moderation in home price inflation. Home prices in S&amp;P Case Shiller's 20-city index increased 5.4%, down from 5.5% the previous month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Portland, Ore., Seattle and Denver led the price gains among the 20 cities but showed signs of slowing. Portland's single-family homes are priced 12.3% higher than a year ago, unchanged from March. Home prices in Seattle and Denver rose 10.7% and 9.5%, respectively, a modest easing from their previous pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Denver, Dallas, Portland, Ore., San Francisco, Seattle, Charlotte and Boston all set single-home price records. The 20-city index is up 39.2% from its March 2012 low. Yet the housing market faces possible headwinds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Last week's vote by Great Britain to leave the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> is the most recent political concern, while the U.S. elections raise uncertainty and will distract home buyers and investors in the coming months," says David M. Blitzer, Managing Director and Chairman of the Index Committee at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday, Maria Mancia saw her son for the first time in 21 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steve Hernandez was taken away from his mom more than two decades ago, by his father, the San Bernardino Sun reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the boy's father abducted him from their Southern California home in 1995, he took every picture of him, even a pregnancy ultrasound, AP reported. Mancia wrote to a relative to get one picture to show the police.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She's been holding on to that photo ever since.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hernandez's father told him his mother abandoned them. In reality, she was searching for him, and worrying about his safety.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In February, the San Bernardino County District Attorney's Child Abduction Unit received a tip that Hernandez was living in Puebla, Mexico. They contacted him and said they were investigating his father, who was missing at the time, and needed an interview and DNA sample.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We didn't want to scare him off," Karen Cragg of the DA's child abduction unit told the New York Daily News.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In two weeks, the Department of Justice said the DNA was a match.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was a shock," Hernandez told the Sun. "I didn't know if she was alive or not and to get a call that says they found my mother and that she had been looking for me, it was like a cold bucket of water. But it's good. It's good. "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday, the mother and son shared a tearful reunion at at the San Bernardino County District Attorney's office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"All that time I didn't know what had happened to him," Mancia, now 42, told the San Bernardino Sun.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">New home sales explode 16.6% in April, giving buyers, sellers an opportunity</span>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spring home-buying season definitely has sprung. Sales of new homes soared 16.6% in April, blowing away economists' expectations for a rise of 1.8%, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. It's a huge turnaround from March, when sales dipped for the third consecutive month. Steve Udelson, president of real estate brokerage Owners.com, breaks down what it all means.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q:What do you think of tuesday's new-home sales data?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A:Sales of new homes increased in April to the highest level in eight years to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 619,000. This signals a healthy real estate market, especially coming on the heels of an increase in existing home sales announced last week. With continued job growth and low mortgage rates, demand is solid. From a regional perspective, sales in the South and Northeast climbed, and sales improved in the West as well. In addition, the Midwest set a fast pace for existing home sales as reported last week. Taken together, this is all good news for the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q:What are your observations about sales so far this year?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: While the early start of the year was a bit slower than usual, the spring real estate market is on a steady incline. It's a strong market from an inventory perspective as well. Buyer demand is exceptionally high in the midpriced market but a bit softer than usual in the very low and very high ends of the market. I project a solid spring real estate season will continue well into the summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q:What are your thoughts on the effects of a possible interest rate increase by the Fed in June?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: There is no doubt interest rates can impact the real estate market and mortgage rates. However, we saw very modest changes during the first interest rate increase last year and anticipate the same this time around. That said, if interest rates go back up to more normal levels, we can expect this will have a bigger impact on mortgage rates and create more pressure from an affordability standpoint. But keep in mind -- the Fed repeatedly has said it will approach any rate increases very incrementally. My advice to buyers is to shop smart and look for opportunities to save on closing costs or take advantage of commission rebates being offered by many brokerages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q:Any advice for buyers right about now?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: Buyers should do their homework and get smart and informed about the home-buying process as the first step. It's no surprise that potential home buyers are using online tools to narrow their search and identify their "dream" homes, learn about the market in certain neighborhoods and understand key facts, like a home's price history. And because this helps buyers be more self-reliant, they can save money on commissions they'd typically have paid to a real estate agent. This can make a big difference when buying a home, which is usually the biggest purchase someone will make in their lifetime.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q:Any advice for sellers right now?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: Sellers can save by doing more of the work on their own, too. Sellers can put together their own listings, figure out how to set the price and sometimes handle the showings. Getting the asking price right is absolutely key. Too high and the listing will go stale, but too low ends up leaving money on the table. Keep in mind the first few weeks a house is listed are the busiest, and often if a house has no offers on it during this time period, the owner may need to re-evaluate the price. It's also important to get high- quality, professional pictures of a home posted online with the listing the first time around. Keep the home as clean and staged as it is in those pictures for visits from potential buyers.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doing the math left them uneasy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stress of it all led to a near-meltdown one day on a trip to <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At their most optimistic, affording a house seemed within the realm of possibility for Elizabeth and David Glidden, both 26. They had saved enough for a 10% down payment. But as they searched for a home, ownership became tenuous when they considered their monthly expenses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buying meant giving up a relatively inexpensive rent-controlled apartment -- a one bedroom for $2,150 a month, including utilities. On top of that, the neighborhoods they could afford would add transportation costs of up to $300 a month because they no longer would be able to walk to work. If they bought a condo, there would also be monthly association fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Young buyers are caught in a quandary. Owning a home has many benefits, including tax breaks and the potential to build value, plus mortgage payments are often lower than rent for a comparable home, especially over the long term. But in some cities, rent can be so high it's difficult, if not impossible, to save the recommended 20% down payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Millennials want to buy homes. That's a good thing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Long term, homeownership is a key part of household wealth creation," says Jonathan Smoke, chief economist for Realtor.com. "If young people are not getting into homeownership at the same stage, it's going to put them further behind from a wealth and retirement perspective."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not to mention the entire housing ecosystem, as Smoke refers to it, falls apart if the cycle of upgrading and then eventually downsizing homes ceases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeownership reverberates through the economy in other ways, too, as homeowners undergo renovations, take on projects that lead to trips to home-improvement stores or buy new furniture and appliances. It's pretty simple: Stores such as <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> and <span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> and tradespeople such as remodelers, painters, roofers and landscapers have more work when lots of people are buying and selling homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> estimates that every two home sales create one job, and that as of 2014 each home sale at the median led to more than $72,000 in economic impact, accounting for factors such as moving expenses, new furniture and the fact that income earned by housing professionals on a home sale gets recirculated back into the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And some researchers point to the social benefits of a healthy housing market. Homeowners become more engaged members of society, with greater civic participation and children of homeowners doing better in school and graduating high school at a higher rate. But the challenges presented by the current housing market to first- time buyers have put many on a prolonged path to the American dream - - even for a couple such as the Gliddens, who have no debt, a dual- income household and more than $50,000 in savings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The more serious you get, the more questions you have of, is this the right thing to do?" David says. "That's sort of been weighing on my mind. I don't know. I don't know if this is the right thing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are a lot of places to lay blame, and it's not just high rents. Many point to crushing student debt loads. But the real culprits, experts say, are the housing crisis and the Great Recession, which forced many Americans into foreclosure. Many who didn't lose their homes found themselves with negative equity -- owing more to their lender than a fair market price. This is commonly referred to as being underwater in a mortgage, and when homeowners feel like they are drowning, they tend to stay put. That leads to not enough affordable supply to meet the demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The biggest single impediment right now is affordable housing, finding homes that are affordable to Millennials," says Svenja Gudell, chief economist with homebuying site Zillow, pointing to the fact that, as of March, inventory was down nearly 6% nationally compared with this time last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elizabeth and David started to lose hope. Elizabeth had been popping into open houses for about a year, but the couple's search became more serious in the past eight months. In all, Elizabeth estimates they'd seen between 40 and 50 units, one of which they had put an offer on that fell through.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm not going to sacrifice budget at all," she says. "At the end of the day, our financial wellness is the most important, and if it doesn't make financial sense, we're not going to buy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After repeatedly failing to find a place that fit both their budget and location requirements, by February the couple was ready to give up. Many young people have given up -- at least for now. Homeownership rates among people under 35 are on the decline, and it's not clear when that trend will reverse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For David and Elizabeth, suspending their search wasn't an enticing option. They worried they'd get priced out of one of the country's more competitive markets as it grows in the coming years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've crunched a lot of numbers and it almost always comes out 50/50, does it make sense, does it not make sense" to buy, Elizabeth says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Persistence paid off for the couple. After months of searching they found a condo and negotiated the price down a few thousand dollars, to $477,375 -- which was over their initial budget of $400,000 to $450,000. They decided to go for it because it had everything they were looking for, including two bedrooms, two baths, an open living space that would fit their furniture, the bonus of a completely updated kitchen, plus it was in a prime location they loved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We hadn't seen anything this nice that fit all of our criteria before," Elizabeth says. "The second we found a place that was exactly what we wanted, all of a sudden that much money made sense."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">USA TODAY</span> was with them on the final leg of their search, through inspection, closing and move-in day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I just want to have something that's mine," Elizabeth says. "There's a sense of wanting to be able to take care of something forever and make it yours over time that you don't get when you rent."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales bounced back nicely in March as inventories remained constrained but expanded modestly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales increased 5.1% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.33 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Wednesday. Economists had predicted that sales rose 4% to a 5.28 million annual rate, according to the median estimate of those surveyed by Bloomberg. February sales tumbled more than 7% and were revised down slightly Wednesday to annual pace of 5.07 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, single-family home sales increased 5.5%, while condominium and co-op sales edged up 1.8%. The median sales price was $222,700, up 5.7% from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Closings came back in full force last month as a greater number of buyers -- mostly in the Northeast and Midwest -- overcame depressed inventory levels and steady price growth to close on a home," says Lawrence Yun, chief economist of the realtors group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added demand is solid and midpriced homes are moving briskly but sales are lackluster at the low and high ends of the market because of a supply crunch and restraints on affordability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tight inventories have limited sales and pushed up prices, further crimping purchases. In March, housing supplies increased 5.9%, and there was a 4.5-month supply of unsold inventory, up from 4.4 months in February. A six-month supply is considered balanced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes turned over rapidly. They were on the market an average 47 days in March, down from 59 in February and matching the briskest pace since last August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales climbed 11.1% in the Northeast and 9.8% in the Midwest, driving March's rebound. Sales rose 2.7% in the South and 1.8% in the West.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing recovery has been a key building block of the economic comeback. And more good news on the housing front is expected Wednesday when new home sales for February are reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street is looking for 510,000 new home sales, up a little more than 3% from the disappointing 494,000 new houses sold in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"January was weak despite the warm weather, so some snapback is likely in February, which also saw generally warmer and less wintery weather," says John Canally, chief economic strategist for <span class="companylink">LPL Financial</span> .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home construction, Canally says, will add to economic growth this year, just as it has every year since 2010. Still, given that housing accounts for roughly 5% of GDP, even a strong housing market likely won't be enough to "offset weakness elsewhere," such as weaker exports and less capital expenditure spending from U.S. businesses, he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, housing continues to enjoy many tailwinds, Canally says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Taking a longer-term look at things like housing affordability, demographics, the labor market, household formation, mortgage rates, rising rents (which affect the rent vs. buy decision), banks willingness to lend, household balance sheets and housing prices -- almost all of these favor ongoing improvement in housing," Canally says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing headwinds include higher prices due to low inventory, which also increases down payment amounts, Canally adds.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gridlock in the housing market that's slowing first-time home purchases and trade-ups to better units is the chief reason for a persistent housing shortage, according to a new study.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report by online real estate site <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> casts doubt on the widespread belief that a scarcity of new construction is the main cause of a crunch that has driven up home prices and slowed sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, the study says, a yawning price gap between midlevel and premium homes that's shutting out many move-up buyers is the biggest obstacle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, a large share of entry-level homes are off the market because they're owned by investors or so-called "underwater" homeowners who owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth, so they effectively can't sell, the study says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Gridlock in the mid- to low- end of the housing market is one of the main reasons for the low inventory," says Ralph McLaughlin, <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>'s chief economist and author of the study.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, there was a four-month supply of existing homes for sale in the U.S. well below a healthy six-month inventory, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. That drove up the median home price by 8.2% the past year, the biggest jump since last April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Yun, the Realtor group's chief economist, says the main reason for the skimpy supply is sluggish single-family housing starts, which hit an eight-year high of 715,000 last year but was below a normal 1.2 million. McLaughlin disagrees, noting that new home sales represent less than 10% of all housing sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study says the answer instead can be found mostly in the makeup of the existing home market. For example, the median list price of a premium home across the U.S. is $542,805, compared with $267,845 for a midpriced home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That gap is 17.3% higher than it was in 2012 and is keeping many midpriced homeowners from trading up, McLaughlin says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McLaughlin partly blames a wealth gap that has seen the incomes of the top third of U.S. households climb more dramatically than those in the middle. And the supply of starter homes is limited because many investors snatched those up when prices hit bottom in 2011.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans stepped back from buying new homes in January, as purchases plunged sharply in Western states where prices typically are higher. The Commerce Department said Wednesday new-home sales fell 9.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 494,000. Most of the decline stemmed from a 32.1% drop in the West. Sales also slipped in the Midwest, while edging up in the Northeast and South.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How much did the recent stock sell-off dent consumer confidence? This week's economic data should provide a good reading, as well as a trove of data on housing, business investment and consumer spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span>'s release on Tuesday of its index of consumer confidence in February will likely be scrutinized more than usual. The measure remained high in January, but that survey was conducted before the plunge in markets. Job growth also slowed in January, but gas prices continued to tumble, perking up motorists. All told, economists expect a modest dip in Americans' outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Solid consumer confidence has helped lift the housing market the past year. In December, existing-home sales rebounded after new mortgage rules curtailed deals in November. In January, sales likely backed off that artificially inflated pace, says Stuart Hoffman, chief economist of PNC Financial Services. Economists expect existing home sales fell 1.1% last month to a 5.4 million seasonally adjusted annual rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales also surged in December, though that was largely because of unseasonably high temperatures. Economist Lewis Alexander of Nomura expects some payback in January, as well as a hit to sales from harsh weather. Economists estimate the Commerce Department will report Wednesday new-home sales fell 4.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 520,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business investment, meanwhile, has been firmly entrenched on the negative side of the economy's ledger. China's slowdown and a strong dollar have hindered exports. And plunging oil prices have clobbered drilling and investment by oil producers. A jump in industrial production last month suggests the pain may have eased. Economists expect Commerce to announce Thursday that orders of durable goods such as cars and appliances rose 2.5% in January as a result of a surge in demand for aircraft. But Hoffman figures orders for capital goods excluding aircraft and defense were flat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer spending has more than offset the economic distress overseas. In January, a core measure of retail sales rose sharply, and Hoffman reckons demand for utilities spiked on colder weather. Economists expect Commerce to record a 0.3% rise in consumption on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The broader economy was weak in the fourth quarter, rising 0.7% at an annual rate, according to Commerce's initial estimate. Alexander says business stockpiling and government and business spending were likely even more sluggish than initially believed. And so Commerce is expected to revise down its estimate of fourth- quarter growth to 0.5%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Feeling wealthy? You'll likely spend more than you ordinarily would.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Feeling a little bit poorer given the drop in the world stock markets in 2016? Well, odds are that you're about to, if you haven't already, cut back on discretionary expenses and start looking for ways to reduce your essential expenses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or at least that's the thinking according to something called the wealth effect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The wealth effect is the change in spending that accompanies a change in perceived wealth. "Usually the wealth effect is positive: Spending changes in the same direction as perceived wealth."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what's going on now? Are pre-retirees and retirees changing their spending as their perceived wealth falls?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Too soon to say. Frank Stafford, a professor at the University of Michigan, says it's too soon to say whether investors have cut back spending, but he says it's likely to happen if the market continues to fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The summer drop in the <span class="companylink">Standard and Poor's</span> 500 stock index and then the more recent drop may or may not be persistent enough to have a major effect," Stafford says. "Yet if the pattern persists or is notable, as in China, then spending will likely be curtailed."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others, however, suggest inertia may get the better of those saving for retirement. "I haven't seen anything about the behavior of those already retired, but the one thing we know for sure about those still saving for retirement is that the vast majority of participants are passive," says Richard Thaler, a professor at the University of Chicago and author of Misbehaving: The Making of Behavioral Economics. "I would not expect much changes in behavior, either in the saving or consumption."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anchors away. And still others see retirement savers becoming increasingly risk averse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Victor Ricciardi, a finance professor at Goucher College in Baltimore and co-editor of Investor Behavior: The Psychology of Financial Planning and Investing, there's a behavioral bias retirement savers tend to suffer from in down markets. It's called anchoring bias.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Investors tend to latch onto a specific piece of data, and this information is a reference point that influences their decisions," he says. "Retirement savers view a stock market decline as a negative anchor."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ricciardi says retirement savers may remember their portfolio's value at stock market highs, before stocks declined in value, and become anchored on "getting back to the stock price highs" of the recent past. "When people anchor on a bad investment event, they can be extremely risk-averse," he says. "This results in higher levels of worry that can cause investors to underweight stocks and over- allocate money in cash within their portfolios."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing prices drive the wealth effect. For his part, Stafford says rising (and falling) house prices have a more dramatic effect on spending than rising or falling stock prices. "The wealth effect from a changing stock market differs from a 'collateral effect' arising from rising house prices -- where the added home equity serves as the basis for collateral for a refinance, for example," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">National home prices, according to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index, are up 31% from February 2012 and now just 5% below the all-time high for home prices set in July 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What to do? So, what should those saving for or living in retirement do, given wealth effect? "Retirement savers with a long- term investment horizon should realize when the market declines it is a buying opportunity," Ricciardi says. "Especially investing with a 401(k) plan, monthly contributions foster the notion of dollar- cost averaging, in which individuals are earning an average price over time rather than buying high and selling low. Dollar-cost averaging helps retirement savers ride the lows and highs of the stock market in order to achieve higher investment returns during their lifetime."</p>

<div>438 words</div><div>19 January 2016</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>FIRST</div><div>B.2</div><div>English</div><div>© 2016 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After several days of stomach-churning market dives, growing fears of global recession and even some jitters about the relatively solid U.S. economy, America's nicely recovering housing market should provide some solace in a light week of economic news.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> delivers its monthly reading on builders' sentiment. With housing starts and new- home sales picking up steam last year and mortgage applications rising recently, <span class="companylink">UBS</span> says the index "is likely to remain at a high level."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by Bloomberg believe it's unchanged in January at a healthy 61.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts posted especially strong gains in November as a result of unusually warm weather. Because December was also balmy, Lewis Alexander, chief U.S. economist at Nomura, reckons that start totals got another boost, a rise that may have been foreshadowed by a November surge in building permits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the activity has been driven by multifamily construction as Millennials move out of their parents' basements and start households. Apartment occupancy and rents are near record highs. Single-family starts have climbed as well, though more moderately. Economists expect the Commerce Department to report Wednesday that starts rose 2.1% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.2million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inflation has been a less cooperative player in the recovery, largely because of plunging oil and gasoline prices and a strong dollar that has meant cheap imports for U.S. consumers. The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> would like to see inflation pick up because it would signify a more vibrant economy and ease worries about stagnant or falling prices that eventually could lead to recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say oil's slide likely kept overall inflation unchanged in December. But with rents and medical costs rising, analysts expect the Labor Department to report that the core consumer price index, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, rose 0.2% last month and was up 2.1% from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like housing starts, existing home sales have advanced smartly this year. In November, however, sales fell sharply, a development economists attribute to new regulations aimed at ensuring consumers understand their mortgage terms following the mid-2000s housing crash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Delays caused by the new rules likely pushed some sales into December, Alexander says. Partly as a result, economists expect the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> to report Friday that sales increased 8.9% last month to an annual rate of nearly 5.2 million.</p>

</div><div class="author">Paul Davidson   </div><div>Paul Davidson, @PDavidsonusat, USA TODAY</div>
<div>705 words</div><div>30 December 2015</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>FIRST</div><div>B.1</div><div>English</div><div>© 2015 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American homeowners are finally digging out of the financial crater formed by the mid-2000s real estate crash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family house prices in nearly 40% of 401 metro areas were at or above their pre-recession peak in the third quarter, according to an analysis of <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> Case-Shiller home price data by Moody's Analytics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's up from 30% of metro areas a year ago, and <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> projects nearly half of the regions will be at or above the milestone at the end of 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a key benchmark," says Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics. "It means more and more people are building equity in their houses again."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, home prices are still about 12% below peak -- up from a nearly 30% deficit in early 2012 -- but that figure belies the progress made in many markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners are benefiting from steadily rising prices, largely because of tight housing supplies. S&amp;P/Case Shiller announced Tuesday that prices in its national index were up 5.2% in October compared to a year ago. <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> estimates prices will climb another 5% or so next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Areas that are already 15% to nearly 50% above their pre- recession pinnacles include Texas cities such as Dallas that were never ensnared by the housing bubble, and energy and technology hotbeds, including Denver, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Bismarck, N.D.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others metro areas recently hit the benchmark or are poised to do so in coming months as a result of healthy economic and job growth, including Boston, Charlotte and Portland, Ore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet many cities in the so-called "sand states" -- Florida, Arizona, Nevada and California -- were hit hardest by the crash and remain well below their peaks, despite substantial gains in home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The return of many markets to their pre-recession highs can be a shot in the arm for consumer confidence. Like a bull stock market, rising home prices create wealth effects that can prod consumers to spend more. In areas where home prices are above their previous apex, consumers spend an additional 3.4 cents for every dollar in increased home value, compared to 1.4 cents in regions below their pre-recession high, according to a <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> study.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With the stock market, people get excited when you pass the previous high," says David Blitzer, managing director of S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. "The housing cycle is a lot longer But I think it does show substantial recovery."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another benefit of the milestone is that it can coax more homeowners to put their houses on the market, alleviating the supply crunch. About 8% of homeowners with mortgages owe more on the loans than their homes are worth and effectively are stuck in the houses, down from nearly 30% several years ago, according to <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>. Yet for many homeowners, only a return to or above the previous high will be enough to entice them to sell, Zandi says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rebound, he says, also should prompt more developers to build homes on overpriced lots they bought before the crash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Charlotte, a skimpy two-month housing supply -- down from a healthy six months -- has driven up prices to pre-recession levels. But many homeowners aren't selling "because they have nowhere to go," thanks to the limited inventory, says Sam Grogan, a broker at Coldwell Banker United. As prices continue to climb, he believes homeowners "are going to feel pressure to sell" by spring, even if it means compromising on the checklist for their next house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jack Seeley, 43, who lives in a four-bedroom house in South Charlotte with his wife and four children, has unsuccessfully hunted for a six-bedroom unit for months. He says the return of home prices to their pre-recession peak won't provide a windfall because he'll have to pay more for his new house as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, he says, "I can put a better down payment," reducing his monthly mortgage costs.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The year closes out with a light week of economic news, highlighted by a couple of sectors that have been growth engines in 2015 -- consumers and housing -- and another that has been anything but -- trade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, the <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span> releases its final gauge of consumer confidence for the year, a reading that can foreshadow consumption. After hitting an eight-year high in January, consumer sentiment has bounced around this year, driven partly by job growth and volatile stocks. It sank to its low for the year in November as Americans' view of the labor market dimmed. Economists estimate the confidence measure rebounded to 93.6 in December from 90.4 as gasoline prices kept tumbling and solid employment growth continued. Despite the ups and downs, the index's average this year has been the highest so far in the recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing has been another bright spot, with sales, starts and prices all trending higher. The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case Shiller home price index generally has risen 5% to 6% this year, largely because of limited housing supplies. That's good for sellers. On the other hand, climbing prices should prod more to put their houses on the market. Richard Moody, chief economist of Regions Financial, figures limited inventories continued to push up prices in October, and economists estimate the 20-city index rose 5.6% from a year go, up from a 5.5% gain in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, the U.S. trade gap has widened this year as a strong dollar hurt exports by making U.S. goods more expensive overseas, adding to the effects of a weak global economy. At the same time, the robust greenback has bolstered imports by pushing down their prices for U.S. consumers. Economists reckon the Commerce Department will report that the trade deficit for goods, the biggest part of the gap, widened to $60.7 billion from $60.3 billion the previous month.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes fell sharply in November, but prices rose and a change in federal closing rules may be to blame for the drop- off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rate of existing-home sales fell to its lowest pace in 19 months, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. Sales fell 10.5% on a seasonally adjusted basis to an annualized rate of 4.76 million, compared to 5.32 million in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the median sale price for single-family homes, townhouses, condominiums and co-ops rose 6.3% to $220,300, compared to the same period a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">National Association of Realtors chief economist Lawrence Yun said the drop-off in the sales rate may be attributable to a new federal process called Know Before You Owe, which he said has lengthened closing times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The monthly survey showed that 47% of agents are reporting an increase in closing times, compared to 37% who were reporting an uptick a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's possible the longer timeframes pushed a latter portion of would-be November transactions into December," Yun said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As long as closing timeframes don't rise even further, it's likely more sales will register to this month's total, and November's large dip will be more of an outlier."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</span> imposed the Know Before You Owe rule effective Aug. 1, requiring new disclosures and procedures to help buyers grasp the details of their mortgages and compare rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders were expected to make changes to internal systems that could at least temporarily lengthen closing processes, according to <span class="companylink">PricewaterhouseCoopers</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One encouraging sign for the housing market was that the average property stayed on the market for 54 days before selling in November, compared to 57 in October and 65 a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage rose from 3.8% to 3.94% in October. <span class="companylink">NAR</span> economists expect the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>'s move to increase interest rates to push the rate up to 4.5% by the end of 2016.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>'s first interest rate hike in almost a decade is history after it finally pulled the trigger last week. Now, on to obsessing about when the central bank will raise rates again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With manufacturing still struggling amid overseas weakness, consumers and the housing market must continue to serve as economic engines if the Fed is going to lift rates at even the gradual pace it has forecast. Reports this week on home sales and consumer spending should begin to reveal whether those sectors will keep delivering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, however, the government will take one more glimpse in the rearview mirror, providing its final estimate of growth in the third quarter. It last reckoned that economic output increased a modest 2.1% at an annual rate in the July-September period. Economists believe the Commerce Department on Tuesday will depict an even dimmer picture of trade as the strong dollar bolstered imports while hobbling exports. That likely prompted companies to draw down inventories even more than previously believed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, economists estimate Commerce will revise down its growth estimate to 1.9%, following a 3.9% expansion in the second quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales have generally been on the positive side of the economy's ledger. But the market cooled in October after surging the previous month. A tight housing supply is likely to continue to restrain sales until new home construction fills the void, says Lewis Alexander, chief U.S. economist of Nomura.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home sales have flashed more positive signs, Alexander notes. Economists expect Commerce on Wednesday to report a 1% rise in new home sales to 500,000 at an annual rate.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>'s expected hike in its benchmark short-term interest rate this week combined with rate increases the next few years is likely to ripple across the U.S. economy, nudging up rates on everything from mortgages to bank savings rates and corporate bonds. But Fed policymakers have stressed they intend to move gradually and in small increments and will pull back if the economy falters, tempering the impact on consumers and businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed is expected to boost rates only a quarter of a point Wednesday and move gradually after that. A 1-percentage-point increase in the Fed's rate over the next year could curtail economic growth the following year by 0.15 percentage points and monthly job gains by 30,000, according to Moody's Analytics. Here's how players in various sectors view the coming rate rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps no sector has benefited more from ultra-low rates than housing, which was devastated by the real estate crash. Home sales are likely to total about 5.7 million this year, up from 5.4 million in 2014 and 4.6 million in 2011. The recovery can at least partly be traced to 30-year fixed mortgage rates that remain below 4%, down from about 6% in 2008, keeping borrowing costs low for buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But today's housing market is supported by far more than low mortgage rates -- namely steady job and economic growth. What's more, 30-year mortgages are priced off 10-year <span class="companylink">Treasury</span> note yields, which do rise as short-term rates climb, but not as steeply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doug Duncan, chief economist of Fannie Mae, the giant government- sponsored funder of mortgages, expects this week's Fed hike of a quarter of a percentage point to have virtually no immediate impact on <span class="companylink">Treasury</span> or mortgage rates, noting markets already have priced in the move. Assuming the Fed raises its rate by a percentage point over the next year, Duncan expects 30-year mortgage rates to drift from 3.9% to 4.1% during the period. That would boost the monthly cost of a typical $225,000 mortgage by $26 to $1,454 -- not enough to deter most buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adjustable-rate mortgages, many of which are modified annually, could increase about twice as rapidly, by about a half a percentage point. Yet as long as job growth and aggregate U.S. incomes increase proportionally, Duncan expects any market impact to be modest. A far bigger restraint on home sales, he says, is a limited supply that should push up prices by nearly 5% both this year and in 2016. As a result, Duncan expects home sales to increase 4% in 2016, down from 8% this year, with higher rates holding back 1% to 2% of deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As long as the rate rise is gradual, I don't see it as a hugely important factor," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Autos</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Auto sales are expected to top 17 million this year for the first time since the Great Recession, juicing the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"(Low rates) definitely have been a factor in people's buying decisions," says Mark Scarpelli, president of Raymond Chevrolet and <span class="companylink">Kia</span>, which owns three dealerships in the Antioch, Ill., area. Auto loans are cheap, with rates ranging from zero with manufacturers' incentives to 3% or so for typical five-year loans, Scarpelli says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he says the improving economy and job market, low gasoline prices and consumers' need to replace aging vehicles are more significant. The typical car on the road is 111/2 years old, a record high, according to IHS Automotive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scarpelli says his sales are up 25% this year. "Consumers are responding to the need to replace their car or truck," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 1-percentage-point increase in Fed rates the next year could have a similar impact on car loans, with a six-month lag, says Joe Pendergast, assistant vice president of consumer lending for <span class="companylink">Navy Federal Credit Union</span>, a top auto lender. That, he says, would amount to just an extra $4 a month or so for a typical loan on a $25,000 car.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's not in our interest to start increasing rates," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scarpelli says slightly higher rates "don't seem to make people walk away from a deal. It will have a measured impact," largely by prodding some consumers to buy less expensive vehicles. He expects higher rates to trim sales by less than 1% in a year and up to 2% in two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction spending is up a healthy 10.7% this year as manufacturing, hotel and office construction takes off. Slightly higher borrowing costs for projects would be unlikely to alter that dynamic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If anything, a move by the Fed might provide a signal to nervous investors that the Fed is confident about the strength of the U.S. economy," says Ken Simonson, chief economist of trade group Associated General Contractors. "Higher rates could also attract more foreign investors in all types of assets, including real estate."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For manufacturers looking to expand for the fast-growing auto and aerospace sectors or office developers serving Millennials moving to cities, a small rise in borrowing costs will barely register, Simonson says. But the hotel- and warehouse-building craze may be winding down, he adds, and a modest rise in rates could discourage activity there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nation's banks are among the few winners spawned by a Fed rate hike. Low rates have forced banks to make do with smaller margins between the interest rate they offer depositors and the rates they charge consumers and businesses for loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most immediate impact of a Fed move will be on the credit cards and home equity loans offered by the nation's largest banks. Those rates are variable and so should rise quickly in response to a higher fed-funds rate, which is what the Fed charges banks for overnight loans. In other words, banks will pass along their higher borrowing costs to consumers and businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently, the average rate on credit card balances is 11.07%, says James Chessen, chief economist of the American Bankers Association. Weeks after the Fed raises its benchmark rate, that rate should rise by a similar amount.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rates on deposits, however, are tied to market forces, he says. Currently, banks are flush with deposits from risk-averse consumers and businesses and so don't need to lift savings rates immediately to attract more deposits for lending, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ronald Paul, CEO of EagleBank, with 22 branches in the Washington, D.C., area, says a rising fed-funds rate of about a percentage point in the next year will likely yield a similar increase in the rate Eagles charges businesses for new loans. Deposit rates could rise by a portion of that amount in about six months, he says, leaving the bank a fatter margin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If my competitor is raising rates, I have to compete," he says. Overall, higher rates "certainly helps us, but it doesn't radically help us."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Money market mutual funds</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Money market funds are another beneficiary. The liquid funds invest in a mix of safe, short-term securities, such as Treasuries. But with yields well below 1%, investors have fled the assets in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total investment in the funds has fallen by nearly half since the 2007-09 recession, says John Carbone, principal and portfolio manager for The Vanguard Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A lot of investors have moved out of money market funds" in an effort to "enhance their returns," Carbone says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That sharply reduces the fees money funds earn from investors. And with yields so low, most funds have waived the typical 0.6% fee they charge anyway to prevent shareholder returns from going negative, Carbone says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anticipation of a quarter-percentage-point increase in the Fed's rate already has pushed up the prime money-market rate from 0.03% to 0.14% over the past six weeks, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It will begin to enhance shareholder returns," Carbone says. "We hope" it will boost his division's revenue as well.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fewer Americans bought homes in October, a sign rising home values might be pushing more would-be buyers to the real estate market's sidelines. The median home sales price was $219,600 in October, a 5.8% annual increase. Purchases declined 8.7% in the West and 3.2% in the South, while dipping 0.8% in the Midwest and staying unchanged in the Northeast on a seasonally adjusted basis.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week's news on the economy should provide an initial snapshot of its performance in the fourth quarter while continuing to highlight its Jekyll-and-Hyde persona.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer spending and the housing market are still humming along. Industrial production and business investment may just be stanching the bleeding. But since consumption makes up more than two-thirds of economic activity, that should be enough to keep the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> on track to raise interest rates next month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales have been a bright spot, fueled by job growth and pent-up demand from Millennials who have put off their first purchases. But after bouncing back in September, sales may be due for a modest pullback. Home supplies remain tight, notes Lewis Alexander, chief U.S. economist of Nomura. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg estimate the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> on Monday will report sales fell 2.5% last month to a still-solid adjusted annual pace of 5.4 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuesday, the government will release its second estimate of economic growth in the third quarter. Its first reading found that domestic demand was healthy, but growth was dragged down by sluggish business stockpiling. Recent data, however, show firms did not draw down their inventories as much as believed. As a result, economists expect the Commerce Department to report the economy grew 2% in the July-September period, up from its initial 1.5% estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer confidence has been volatile, buffeted by the turbulent stock market and a slump in job growth. But stocks have rallied lately, gasoline remains cheap and payroll growth rebounded in October. Economists expect the <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span> to announce a rise in consumer confidence for November from 97.6 to 99.2, close to its post-recession high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low pump prices and robust employment gains likely kept shoppers in a spending mood. Commerce is expected to report Wednesday that consumer spending rose 0.3% last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business investment hasn't fared as well, largely because of the oil industry slide and a strong dollar that has hurt exports. Yet there are signs those effects are stabilizing. Capital goods orders excluding aircraft and defense -- a proxy for business spending -- likely ticked up 0.1% in October, according to estimates of Commerce's durable goods data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While existing-home sales surged last month, newly built units fell. Economists thus expect Commerce to record a 6.8% rebound last month.</p>

<div>543 words</div><div>27 October 2015</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>FIRST</div><div>B.1</div><div>English</div><div>© 2015 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home construction should hit a post-recession high this year, but a fundamental problem is preventing a bigger surge: shortages of places to put the units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders are increasingly complaining of a dearth of developed lots, a crunch growing more prominent as housing starts pick up. They blame regulations, tight financing for lot development and buyers' growing preference to live in or near land-constrained cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's likely limiting the number of new homes for sale," says David Crowe, chief economist of the National Association of Home Builders. And skimpy supplies are "raising the price of a house."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home sales fell 11.5% in September, the Commerce Department said Monday, but they're up 18% for the year, and builders' sales expectations are at a 10-year high. NAHB expects 1.1 million housing starts this year, up from 1 million in 2014 and the most since the 2007 real estate crash but still short of the 1.5 million historical average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason starts aren't accelerating faster is the shortage of developed lots. Typically, a developer installs infrastructure such as roads and sewer lines on a vacant parcel of land and sells the tract to a builder. Earlier this year, 57% of builders said they expect the cost and availability of developed lots to be among their most significant problems in 2015, up from 46% in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the reasons:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regulations and local demands. Federal environmental rules have gotten tougher in recent years, including a broader definition of wetlands that builders must avoid or mitigate. Meanwhile, local governments increasingly require concessions from developers, such as financing the expansion of a sewage plant. That can delay or scuttle projects, and it's more prevalent as the improving economy reduces local officials' need for the tax revenue that new development brings, Crowe says. Builders told NAHB that regulations have added seven months to projects, up from four months in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Randy Noel, head of Reve, a home builder in New Orleans' western suburbs, says more expensive wetlands mitigation mandates have curtailed lot development. He plans to cease subdivision construction next year and build pricier homes on isolated lots. "I've been begging (developers) to get something in the ground," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Limited financing. Banks remain wary of financing land acquisition and development, leaving fewer lots for builders. Of those that develop land and build houses, about 13% said they didn't seek a loan earlier in the year, certain they wouldn't get it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some lenders are raising costs. Dean Mon, head of the Mon Group, says he'll build 48 apartments in Union City, N.J., instead of three projects with 132 units because he can borrow just 80% of the cost, down from 90%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Less land in cities. Many buyers want to live in or near cities for amenities, but there are few available lots, especially for multifamily complexes, Zillow economist Svenja Guddell says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GROWING PROBLEM</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Portion of builders saying cost/availability of developed lots is among their most significant problems:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2013:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">46%</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2014:</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing, a sore spot during the Great Recession and post- financial crisis period, is now a beacon of hope. The real estate recovery, while choppy, arguably has been a bright spot, thanks to a drop in the unemployment rate to 5.1%, still-low interest rates and higher prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monday, an index measuring home-builder confidence levels in October not only topped Wall Street estimates, but also hit a post- recession high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now investors are hoping the renewed confidence on behalf of builders and developers could be due to builders breaking ground on more houses than forecast in September. The housing starts number is set for release at 8:30 a.m. ET Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Wall Street is expecting starts to tick up to an annualized pace of 1.145 million units, up from 1.126 million in August, according to <span class="companylink">UBS</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street will be watching closely to see if the new activity is picking up in single-family homes instead of multifamily units, a trend that is just starting to show its green-shoots. Any signs that builders are starting to focus more of their efforts on single- family dwellings could signal another thaw in the housing market, which is still trying to put the challenging times of the last real estate bust behind it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of more single-family homes is a bullish development, as it suggests more homebuyers have the financial means to finance a purchase on their own and signals a shift away from building multiunit rental units.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The late August stock sell-off was a reminder of the financial market's jitters despite more jobs, the availability of easy credit and a robust housing market. With growth slowing in other parts of the world, the economic data this week will have sprinkles of warning signs that could test the resilience of the U.S. economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The state of consumers' pocketbooks will be revealed Monday as personal income and spending data are released by the Commerce Department's <span class="companylink">Bureau of Economic Analysis</span> (BEA). With earnings rising, personal income likely eked out growth, up 0.4% in August, estimates research firm Nomura. It was up 0.4% in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, consumers continue to loosen their purse strings, albeit modestly. Retail sales were up 4% in August. And Nomura estimates personal spending likely rose at a similar rate. Consumer activity "has been shaky this year despite improving consumer fundamentals," Nomura Chief U.S. Economist Lewis Alexander wrote in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With low interest rates and a resilient job market, home sales have held steady this year. After falling unexpectedly in June, existing-home sales rebounded 0.5% month-over-month in July, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. Nomura estimates another month of steady growth, forecasting an increase of 0.4% in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller 20-city home price index rose 5.0% year-over-year in June. And when it is updated for July on Tuesday, Nomura expects it to inch up to 5.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent volatility in the stock market will likely leave its imprint in the consumer confidence data out Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August, the <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span>'s consumer confidence index climbed to the second-highest level in eight years. But the cutoff date for the survey was Aug. 13, which means the stock market drop in late August likely wasn't accounted for.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The jobs report, due Friday, could signal a mild slowdown in the labor market that is still producing plenty of jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unemployment rate fell in August to 5.1%, but analysts saw a warning sign in the fact that non-farm payroll growth increased by below 200,000 for the first time since April.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After markets were rattled last week by the Fed's decision to leave interest rates unchanged amid global economic troubles, investors may seek solace in the solid domestic economy. A light week of economic news features reports on the resurgent housing market, business investment and second-quarter growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> releases its report on existing-home sales in August. Sales have risen three straight months and, in July, single-family homes were snapped up at the fastest pace in eight years. A headwind, however, is the limited supply of homes for sale, says Lewis Alexander, Nomura's chief U.S. economist. Economists estimate existing-home sales dipped 1.6% last month to a still healthy annual pace of 5.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The picture for business investment has been far cloudier. Such spending rebounded in July after limping through the first half of the year as low oil prices and a strong dollar hampered drilling activity and U.S. exports. Since then, however, the Chinese economy has shown worrisome weakening signs, rocking markets and business confidence and causing more volatility for crude prices and the greenback. Analysts believe vehicle production dipped last month after surging in July. Economists estimate the Commerce Department will report Thursday that core capital goods orders excluding aircraft and defense -- a proxy for business investment -- dipped 0.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like existing-home sales, new-home sales have had a nice run lately and economists reckon that continued in August. Single- family housing starts have been strong, and permits hit a nearly eight-year high last month, Alexander notes. Economists estimate Commerce will report that new-home sales rose 1.6% in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The upswing in new-home sales and starts should figure into an upward revision for construction and consumer spending in Commerce's final estimate of second-quarter economic growth Friday. Offsetting those is a likely downward revision to business stockpiling, leaving the growth estimate unchanged at a healthy 3.7% annual rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer confidence, meanwhile, took a hit because of plunging stocks, with the <span class="companylink">University of Michigan</span>'s first estimate of consumer sentiment in September reflecting a sharp decline.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts slump 3%</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders broke ground on fewer houses and apartment complexes in August. Housing starts fell 3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.13 million homes, the Commerce Department said Thursday. "This is a mere blip on the radar," said Tom Wind, executive vice president of home lending at EverBank. "The housing market's underlying fundamentals remain on pace for continued recovery."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Holiday shopping could get interesting this year with Amazon's announcement of a new 7-inch Fire tablet for $49.99. While not exactly a stocking-stuffer price, the Seattle company is also selling the tablets in a six-pack for just under $250, bringing them down to $41 each. The new tablets specifically go for what David Limp, a senior vice president for Amazon devices, calls its "sweet spot, the consumption of media."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans stepped up their purchases of new homes in July. Sales surged 23.1% in the Northeast, with smaller gains in the South and West. Sales slumped in the Midwest. The Commerce Department says new home sales rose 5.4% nationally to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 507,000. Backed by solid job growth over the past two years and relatively low mortgage rates, new home sales jumped 21.2% through the first half of 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer confidence rebounds sharply in Aug.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. consumer confidence hit its strongest reading in seven months. The consumer confidence index was 101.5 in August, up from a revised July reading of 91.0. The cutoff for responses was before the recent stock plunge.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors could use some good news after a week of brutal stock losses. Perhaps the market can get a lift this week from economic reports that should show stronger second-quarter growth, a continued housing upturn, solid consumer spending and even the hint of a turnaround in sluggish business investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has been a bright spot, and data set to be released Tuesday should support the sunny outlook. Tuesday, the Commerce Department is likely to report a 6% rise in new home sales in July after the sector slumped the previous month. July housing starts climbed to an eight-year high, and builders are optimistic, according to a closely watched sentiment index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices have risen moderately after tight supplies sparked sharp gains last year. The S&amp;P/Case-Shiller price index of 20 large cities is estimated to have risen 5.1% in June from a year earlier, in line with steady increases in recent months. That pace "could provide enough incentive to encourage homeowners to put their homes on the market while encouraging potential home buyers back into the market," Lewis Alexander, Nomura's chief U.S. economist, wrote in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, consumers have been digesting mixed developments. Gasoline prices generally have stayed low, but stocks have been volatile, even before last week's plunge, and economic turmoil in China and Greece have sparked growing worries. Economists estimate the <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span> will report that consumer confidence rebounded modestly in August to a solid index of 93 after a sharp slide the previous month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business investment has lagged, mostly because of low oil prices that have crimped energy company spending and a strong dollar that hobbles exports. Economists expect at least a modest rebound in the second half of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Commerce report out Wednesday should show that July capital goods orders excluding aircraft and defense -- a proxy for business capital spending -- rose 0.5%, economists estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest shot in the arm for the economy and markets could come Thursday, when Commerce releases its revised estimate of second- quarter growth. Largely as a result of stronger-than-expected consumer spending, commercial construction and business stockpiling, analysts reckon the economy grew 3.2% in the April-June period, up from the previous 2.3% estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of economic activity, probably got off to a good start in the third quarter. Commerce is likely to report Friday that consumption increased 0.3% in July after solid gains the three previous months.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Thursday that sales of existing homes rose 2% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.59 million, the fastest rate since February 2007. Sales have jumped 9.6% over the past 12 months, while the number of listings has declined 4.7%. The median home price climbed 5.6% over the past 12 months to $234,000.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing homes sold at the fastest pace in eight years last month and the median sales price reached a record high, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales increased 3.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.49million in June. Economists had forecast sales at a 5.4million annual rate, according to the median estimate of those surveyed by Bloomberg. May sales were revised down slightly to annual pace of 5.32million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Yun, chief economist of the realtors group, pronounced this year's spring buying season the strongest since the economic downturn. "Buyers have come back in force, leading to the strongest past two months in sales since early 2007," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yun attributed the brisk sales to strong job growth, improved household finances and rising mortgage rates that are prodding Americans to buy now before rates climb further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price of a previously owned home was $236,400, 6.5% above the year-ago price and above the peak price set in July2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tight housing supplies pushed up prices. The crunch had been constraining sales but did not seem to pose a big obstacle last month. The inventory of unsold homes dipped to a five-month supply from 5.1 months in May. A six-month supply is generally considered balanced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The skimpy stockpiles led to rapid sales. Homes were on the market for an average 34 days in June, down from 40 days in May and the shortest turnaround since the association began tracking the figure in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The resurgent home sales market could provide a spark to the economy. Healthy sales further reduce supplies, leading to more home construction. That generates numerous jobs in building, manufacturing and other industries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June, the share of homes purchased by first-time buyers dipped to 30% from 32% in May after climbing recently, but it remains above the year-ago figure of 28%. Stronger job and income growth are spurring many young adults to move out on their own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family home sales increased 2.8%, and co-op and condominium sales jumped 6.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales rose 4.3% in the Northeast, 4.7% in the Midwest, 2.5% in the West and 2.3% in the South.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earnings season picks up steam next week with a parade of reports from tech bellwethers such as Apple, Amazon, <span class="companylink">IBM</span> and <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> as well as retail giants <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span> and <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span>. The second quarter got off to a solid start last week, with most companies beating estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apple's stock has been weighed down by fears that China's slowing economy is curbing consumers' appetite for smartphones and other gadgets. Still, the tech colossus is expected to post earnings of $1.79 per share, up from $1.28 a year ago. Amazon, meanwhile, is forecast to show a loss of 18 cents a share, down from a 27-cent loss last year. But the profits of both <span class="companylink">IBM</span> and <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> are expected to narrow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">McDonald's</span>, which has struggled recently amid a trend toward healthier food, is expected to report per-share earnings of $1.23, down from $1.40 a year ago, while <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span> should ring in 41 cents a share, up 20%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economic news will be dominated by the housing market, which has shown signs that it's poised to help drive the economy this year after extreme winter weather slowed activity in the first quarter. Existing sales surged 5.1% in May to the highest level in six years as strong job and income growth spurred buyers. An encouraging development is that the share of first-time home buyers in the market rose to 32% in May from 30% in April and 27% a year earlier, according to <span class="companylink">UBS</span> and the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. Meanwhile, the share of sales of owner-occupied homes is rising, while investor sales are slipping.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the downside, a tight inventory of available homes looms as a possible headwind, says Lewis Alexander, Nomura's chief economist. Yet with an index of pending home sales -- which foreshadows future sales -- up a solid 0.9% in May, economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the Realtors group on Wednesday to report a similar increase for June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.4 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New homes are typically purchased by higher-income existing homeowners and represent about 16% of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales also have picked up recently, rising 2.2% in May. Economists expect the Commerce Department on Friday to report that the market paused a bit in June, with sales dipping 1.1%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. financial markets are bracing for more volatility this week after <span class="companylink">European Union</span> leaders were expected to decide Sunday whether to give Greece another bailout in exchange for substantial deficit cuts and other reforms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, reports on retail sales, industrial production and housing starts are projected to depict a U.S. economy that's gearing up for a stronger second half of 2015. Nasty weather and a West Coast ports slowdown hindered growth early in the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May, consumers finally spent more of their hefty savings from cheap gasoline. Economists estimate a further pickup occurred in June amid strong job and income growth. Those surveyed by Action Economics predict the Commerce Department on Tuesday will report that retail sales rose a solid 0.6% following a 1.2% increase in May. Sales, excluding volatile autos and gasoline, likely increased 0.3%, according to a forecast by The <span class="companylink">PNC Financial Services Group</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, industrial production has been anemic, with a strong dollar making U.S. exports more expensive for foreign buyers and low oil prices hammering drilling activity and related production of steel and other materials. Many economists expect a modest manufacturing rebound the rest of the year. Economists expect the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> on Wednesday to report that industrial output rose 0.2% last month, reversing May's decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">The Fed</span>, by the way, is eager to see inflation pick up, providing the evidence it needs to begin raising interest rates. After falling early in 2015 on plunging gasoline prices, consumer prices surged in May on rising pump costs. Economists expect a 0.3% increase in June when prices are announced on Friday. Excluding volatile food and gas prices -- the Fed's preferred measure -- prices likely rose 0.2% and were up 1.8% the past 12 months, economists estimate. That would be up slightly from May and a tad closer to the Fed's annual 2% target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has been a bright spot lately, with housing starts hitting an eight-year high in April before slowing in May. Economists expect to see a 6% rise in June when housing starts are announced on Friday. Senior PNC economist Gus Faucher notes that housing permits in May -- a gauge of future construction -- jumped to their highest since 2007. Meanwhile, he says, home construction has been buoyed by strong payroll growth, low mortgage rates and higher household formation as Millennials move into homes.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A healthy housing market is a key pillar of the ongoing U.S. recovery, as home purchases fuel all sorts of other purchases, ranging from new appliances to flat-screen TVs to family room couches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's why Wall Street is looking for a repeat of the May reading on existing home sales released Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales jumped a better-than-expected 5.1% to a seasonally adjusted 5.35 million units, the fastest pace of activity since November 2009. Home sales are up 9.2% year-over-year, according to Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Sterne Agee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors are bracing for two fresh data points set for release Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 9 a.m. ET, the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> releases its April home price index. An hour later, Wall Street gets the results of new home sales in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Kelly at <span class="companylink">JPMorgan</span> Funds expects FHFA home prices to "look strong." He adds that new home sales "could take a dip after a good gain last month, but should generally point to a healthy housing industry."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Piegza notes that home sales have begun to "suggest upward momentum after a stagnant, sideways trajectory since late 2012."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for housing to remain robust, a few things need to fall into place, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Consumers will need a consistently improving ability to finance a home purchase," Piegza says. "That ability will stem from future improvement in job and income growth."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts slowed in May, coming off an eight-year high in April. Home builders are still catching up after harsh weather hampered construction this past winter, economists say. Builders broke ground on almost 1.04 million privately owned homes in May, down 11.1% from April's 1.35 million, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Uber-Richskis (rich Russians) is the new byword for opulent dwellers in some of the most exclusive neighborhoods here. A continent away in Vancouver, the number "8" -- a symbol of good fortune in China -- adorns windows of real-estate brokers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 3,000 miles to the south of that Canadian city, Miami has become the housing mecca for Latin American millionaires seeking a haven from political and economic chaos that threaten their wealth at home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A handful of elite cities around the world have increasingly become magnets for residential investments from super-rich foreigners looking for safe places to park their fortunes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They invested approximately $25billion in cross-border residential real estate in 2014, according to Chicago-based <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>, an investment management company that specializes in property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Living in the world's most desirable cities has long been associated with exorbitant housing prices for a multitude of reasons, ranging from high infrastructure costs to demand that far outstrips the supply. Yet this vast injection of wealth is contributing to soaring home prices in places as far flung as London, Vancouver, Miami, New York, Panama City, Istanbul and Sydney.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has also distorted home prices in some city centers beyond the reach of all but the world's wealthiest individuals at a time when 330million urban households worldwide live in substandard housing, the <span class="companylink">McKinsey Global Institute</span> estimates. For millions of middle- class -- and even upper-middle-class -- families urban life in these cities is out of the question.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The international picture is very obviously what I call 'flight money,'" said Matthew Montagu-Pollack, publisher of the Global Property Guide, an online resource for people looking to purchase homes abroad. "This money can be associated with anything from Chinese parents that have kids in college in the USA to those that don't feel secure in their home countries."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are not in the 1940s anymore, where if you were Jewish in Germany you probably didn't have an account across the border. Now, anyone with money who lives in Russia or China or in the Middle East -- where it's possible the <span class="companylink">Islamic State</span> could overwhelm the Gulf suddenly -- will keep some wealth outside," Montagu-Pollack said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said it is difficult to quantify how much foreign investors are driving up property prices because of scant data, but that doesn't mean it's not happening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past year, residential property prices in prime locations favored by foreign investors rose sharply -- 19% in New York, 15% in Bali and Istanbul, 13% in Dublin and 11% in Sydney, according to Knight Frank, a London-based real estate consulting firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From 2008 to 2012, average house prices in Hong Kong -- ranked as the world's least-affordable city for housing -- rose more than 117%, according to the Global Property Guide. The average property in London costs $750,000, a one-year jump of 19%, according to <span class="companylink">Britain's Office for National Statistics</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board says Chinese investors pumped nearly $6billion into the residential housing market there in 2013. Australia recently announced restrictions on non-resident foreign nationals who want to purchase homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"One of the biggest trends we are monitoring across pretty much all the markets we focus on is the ongoing globalization of demand for property," Liam Bailey, Knight Frank's global head of research, wrote in the firm's 2015 report on global wealth. That means those with more modest incomes are driven out, he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in 20 U.S. cities rose faster than expected in March, powered by limited supply for sale, according to a closely-watched economic report issued Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report issued by the federal government also showed new single-family home sales rose more than expected in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller index reported that property values for the 12 cities rose 5% year-over-year compared with March 2014. The result topped the 4.6% consensus forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, home prices recorded a 4.1% annual gain in March, compared with a 4.2% increase in February 2014, the index showed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">San Francisco and Denver reported the highest year-over-year price gains, with increases of 10.3% and 10% respectively over the last 12 months. Dallas rounded out the top three cities, with a 9.3% year-over-year gain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national index gained 0.8% month-over-month in March, with both the 10-city and 20-city composites reporting significant increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">San Francisco led all cities with a 3% monthly rise in home prices, followed by Seattle with a 2.3% jump. New York was the only city to report a negative month-over-month change, with home prices down 0.1% for March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Home prices have enjoyed year-over-year gains for 35 consecutive months," said David Blitzer, managing director and chairman of the Index Committee for <span class="companylink">S&amp;P</span><span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> Indices. "The patter of consistent gains is national." However, the annual rate of increase halved in the last year, Blitzer said. Home prices are currently rising more quickly than either per capita personal income or wages, narrowing the potential pool of future home buyers, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"All of this suggests that some future moderation in home prices gains is likely," Blitzer said. "Moreover, consumer debt levels seem to be manageable. I would describe this as a rebound in home prices, not a bubble and not a reason to be fearful."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, a joint report by the <span class="companylink">U.S. Census Bureau</span> and the Department of Housing and Urban Development showed that sales of new single-family homes rose 6.8% in April to a seasonally adjusted rate 517,000 units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The March rate was revised upward to 484,000, 3,000 units higher than the government's initial estimate for the month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price of new houses sold in April was $297,300 according to the government report. The seasonally adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of April was 205,000, a supply of 4.8 months at the current sales rate, the report said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A holiday-shortened week will deliver a batch of data on housing, consumer confidence and business investment that's likely to reflect mixed results as the economy transitions from a rough winter to stronger growth in the second half of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home price gains have picked up recently after slowing last year, with annual increases accelerating three straight months amid tight housing supplies. Economists reckon the market paused in March, with the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case-Shiller's 20 city index, out today, rising 4.6% in March year-over-year, down from 5% in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer confidence plunged last month after the government reported puny job growth in March. The labor market rebounded in April, but the economy struggled in the first quarter, and Americans don't expect a quick turnaround based on the <span class="companylink">University of Michigan</span>'s consumer sentiment reading for May. As a result, economists expect a further modest decline in the <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span>'s consumer confidence index, to 94 from 95.2. The measure hit an eight- year high of 103.8 in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business investment has been on a steady decline since last summer amid low oil prices, which are hampering drilling activity, and a strong dollar, which is pummeling U.S. exports. Economists expect just a modest rebound in April, with the Commerce Department projected to report that orders for durable goods, excluding aircraft and defense, rose 0.4%. Lewis Alexander, chief U.S. economist of Nomura, is looking for a gradual pickup in coming months as both the dollar and oil prices stabilize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Commerce report on new home sales should bring better news. Sales of newly built homes cratered in March in the aftermath of the nasty winter. But a healthy rise in mortgage applications recently portends a solid bounce-back in April, <span class="companylink">UBS</span> says. Economists estimate sales jumped 4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 500,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Friday, though, is likely to deliver another downer with Commerce's expected revision to first-quarter economic growth. It initially reported the nation's gross domestic product grew just 0.2% in the January-March period. But recent readings on exports and retail sales have been weaker than anticipated. And Alexander estimates that business stockpiling grew more slowly than the government first estimated. Economists expect the revision to show the economy shrank 0.9% in the period, repeating a pattern of weak first-quarter growth.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales unexpectedly fell in April on low housing supplies and higher prices after reaching an 18-month high the previous month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales declined 3.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.04 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists had forecast that homes sold at a 5.23 million annual rate, according to the median estimate of those surveyed by Bloomberg.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family home sales fell 3.7%. Sales of town homes, condominiums and co-ops were unchanged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, sales of previously owned homes hit an annual rate of 5.21 million -- revised up slightly from NAR's estimate last month and the fastest pace since September 2013 -- as the market bounced back after a harsh winter curbed activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low mortgage rates and solid job growth should continue to support the housing market this year, economists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"April's setback is the result of lagging supply relative to demand and the upward pressure it's putting on prices," says National Association of Realtors chief economist Lawrence Yun. "However, the overall data and feedback we're hearing from Realtors continues to point to elevated levels of buying interest compared to a year ago."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales in April were 6.1% above year-ago levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supplies increased but remained skimpy. Inventory of unsold homes increased to a 5.3-month supply from 4.6 months in March. A six- month supply is generally considered balanced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median existing home price last month rose 8.9% to $219,400.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With housing demand far outpacing supply, homes in April sold in 39 days on average, the fastest clip since July 2013. The tight inventory is sparking bidding wars in many markets, Yun says. About four of 10 homes sold last month went for the asking price or more, the largest share since the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> began tracking the data in December 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales fell in the Northeast, South and West, while rising modestly in the Midwest.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer confidence unexpectedly tumbled in April as disappointing job growth more than offset still-low gas prices. The <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span>'s index of consumers' perceptions fell to 95.2 from 101.4 in March. That's the lowest this year and well below economists' estimate of 102.5. Regular gas has risen to $2.54 a gallon from $2.43 a month ago. That's still well below last year's $3.70, AAA says. But monthly job growth slowed to just 126,000 in March, lowest since December 2013. Separately, home prices rose 5% year-over-year compared with 4.5% in January, according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller 20-city index of home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ALL EYES ON <span class="companylink">THE FED</span></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> policymakers end their two-day meeting today. There's virtually no chance the central bank will hike rates after stating last month that an April move was unlikely. But investors will still scour the post-meeting statement when it is released at 2 p.m. ET for clues as to whether a June liftoff remains a possibility. Fed policymakers' median interest-rate forecast last month was consistent with an initial increase occurring in September. Recent weak economic data for the first quarter have only solidified expectations that officials won't pull the trigger until then, or possibly even later. <span class="companylink">The Fed</span>'s benchmark rate has been near zero since the 2008 financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">INVESTORS FLEE U.S. STOCKS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Global fund investors have yanked a net $15.4 billion from U.S. stock mutual funds and exchange-traded funds this month through April 24, says TrimTabs Investment Research. That's nearly $900 million a day. At the same time, they have poured $34.8 billion into international stocks this month, or about $1.6 billion a day. Most of that money has gone to red-hot emerging markets.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales in March leaped to their fastest pace in 18 months, making a well-timed upturn at the start of the peak spring buying season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales rose 6.1% -- the largest increase since December 2010 -- to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.19 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists' median forecast for the March sales rate was 5.03million, according to Action Economics' survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monthly sales last topped a 5million annual rate in December, and March's rate was the highest since October's 5.16 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NAR's figures cover completed transactions on single-family homes, town homes, condominiums and co-ops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total inventory at the end of March rose 5.3% to 2 million existing homes available for sale, and 2% above a year ago, NAR said. Unsold inventory is at a 4.6-month supply, down slightly from 4.7 months in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That indicates the supply of homes for sale is still tight. A six- month supply is considered a market balanced between buyers and sellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other recent signs have pointed to a pickup in sales. The NAR's seasonally adjusted pending home sales index hit its highest level since June 2013 in February. The index tracks signings of contracts to buy homes and is an indicator of future sales one or two months later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes fell 2.9% last year from 2013, but prices also rose more slowly -- at 5.7%, about half the rate in the previous year. NAR predicts average prices will rise a similar amount this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NAR's report Wednesday showed median prices rose 7.8% from March 2014, accelerating from a 2.6% rate in February to its fastest pace in a year, TD Economics' Michael Dolega said in a research note Wednesday morning. Single-family homes led the price gains; values increased 8.7% from the previous year, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The report was an uplifting one, especially after months of disappointments during the harsh winter," Dolega said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He predicts existing home sales will see their best year of the economic recovery in 2015, rising to nearly a 5.5-million rate later this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report from the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> on Wednesday said U.S. house prices rose 0.7% in February on a seasonally adjusted basis from January. FHFA's housing price index was 2.9% below its March 2007 peak and about the same as in January 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FHFA's index is based on mortgages sold to or guaranteed by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, which FHFA regulates.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Staying dry is the key to surviving April rainstorms. The same could be said for investors -- not getting soaked with bum stock picks is the way to survive in the market in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there's one theme that's been consistently working for investors in the month of April, it's real estate. There are 15 stocks in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500, including a slew of real estate- related companies, such as <span class="companylink">Macerich</span>, <span class="companylink">DR Horton</span> and <span class="companylink">Essex Property Trust</span>, that have beaten the market each of the last five Aprils, according to a USA TODAY analysis of data from <span class="companylink">S&amp;P Capital IQ</span>. All these stocks have also posted average gains of 5% or more during the past five Aprils.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">April has been somewhat of a wild card for investors, with returns that have swung from a 9% decline in 1970 to a 9.4% gain in 2009. Last April, stocks took a pause and fell 0.2%. Not a loss that would seriously wound a portfolio, but definitely a setback.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if there's been a sector that appears to work in the month of April, real estate comes instantly to mind. Half of the 15 stocks that have consistently beaten the market during April are in real estate-related industries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take <span class="companylink">Macerich</span> as a key example. The Santa Monica, Calif.-based real estate investment trust buys and develops mainly community shopping centers in the U.S. Shares of the stock have gained an average 7.5% during the past five Aprils, making it the second best- performing stock during the period, just behind utility <span class="companylink">NRG Energy</span>. <span class="companylink">Macerich</span> hasn't fallen in a single April in the past five years -- and that doesn't even include the better-than-the-market current dividend yield of 3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some fear this April could be different. <span class="companylink">Macerich</span>'s shares have done so well -- gaining more than 40% over the past year -- analysts aren't bullish on it anymore. Shares of <span class="companylink">Macerich</span> are trading for about $80 after the company rejected a hostile takeover offer from rival <span class="companylink">Simon Property Group</span> and Simon dropped the bid. Analysts think the stock is worth roughly $86 in 18 months, says <span class="companylink">S&amp;P Capital IQ</span>. Valuation is a big reason why <span class="companylink">Macerich</span> is rated a "hold" on average by analysts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big wild card for REITs is what the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> does with short-term interest rates. REITs have been one of the biggest winners from the Fed's determination to keep rates low, says Jack Ablin of <span class="companylink">BMO</span> Capital Bank, not talking about any specific stock. "Despite record level valuations," REITs could continue to do well "as long as rates stay low," Ablin says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's not to say all real estate stocks that are April winners are played out. Analysts are still bullish on <span class="companylink">Simon Property</span>, an Indianapolis-based REIT that focuses on malls. The stock has been a champion over the past five Aprils, gaining an average 6.7% during the month the past five years. Shares of <span class="companylink">Simon Property</span> haven't run up as much as the other REITs. As a result, there's still about 8% upside in the stock before it hits its 18-month average price target of $212.27 from analysts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ablin, though, says macro forces at play in April could change what's been working for investors in years past. Housing data have been moderate, but "new-home sales are below what demographics would suggest," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, small U.S. stocks are at or near valuations that are record levels. Bigger opportunities are in stocks overseas that are trading for up to 25% the <span class="companylink">S&amp;P 500</span>. International "economies are beginning to surprise economists to the upside," Albin says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither rain nor snow dampened the U.S. economy from early January through mid-February, according to the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>'s "beige book," an anecdotal survey of business conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy continued to expand in most of the Fed's 12 districts, with Richmond being the sole exception. Despite near- record amounts of snow, the Fed's Boston district said business contacts were fairly upbeat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">The Fed</span> is charged with keeping the economy humming and fighting inflation, and the beige book gave little indication that inflation was on the rise. Wage pressures were moderate in most districts and limited to skilled workers. Most district contacts cited only flat to slightly increasing prices, the Fed says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bright spots</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most districts said that consumer spending, the main engine of the economy, increased from the previous beige book. Most districts said that retailers were optimistic. In snowbound Boston and Cleveland, retailers reported increased sales of winter clothes, rock salt and snow shovels. Auto sales rose in most districts as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturing activity increased in most districts as well, although the increases were spotty. Automobile manufacturing output rose in the Cleveland, Chicago and St. Louis districts, and San Francisco aerospace manufacturers expect 2015 to be a record year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Transportation demand generally improved, the Fed says, and contacts in Atlanta and Philadelphia reported record shipping volume. Atlanta contacts said labor slowdowns on the West Coast may account for its improvement in business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dark spots</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plunge in oil prices is taking its toll in the oil patch. Demand for oil services and equipment fell sharply in Dallas, and demand for drilling services in the Minneapolis district fell as well. <span class="companylink">The Fed</span> says the number of drilling rigs for oil and natural gas declined sharply in the Cleveland, Minneapolis and Kansas City districts, and many oil and gas producers say they will cut back on capital expenditures this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bad weather slowed construction activity in New York, Philadelphia and Cleveland, and home sales fell in Cleveland and Kansas City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low levels of inventory and lack of desirable lots continued to slow the market. Nevertheless, commercial real estate improved in most districts, and most residential markets reported increased sales and prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And things are not good down on the farm. "Agricultural conditions worsened since the previous report across the districts due to weak farm income, persistent drought and declining exports," the Fed says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Prices for corn and soybeans fell over the reporting period in the Chicago, Kansas City and Dallas districts. A majority of contacts in the Minneapolis and Kansas City districts noted that farm incomes had fallen from year-earlier levels."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home sales gained nearly 12% in December, and while economists expect the momentum in the housing market to continue, a repeat of the double-digit gains isn't likely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An impressive 481,000 new homes were sold in December, which outpaced the 450,000 sales economists had forecast. But the 11.6% sales gain from November 2014 was "probably exaggerated," Maury Harris, an economist at <span class="companylink">UBS</span>, told clients in a report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He notes that the strong sales gains in the final month of 2014 didn't jibe with the 3.7% drop in pending home sales, or the number of signed home contracts, in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Harris and the rest of Wall Street is expecting sales gains in the new home market again in the first month of 2015. Wall Street is expecting 475,000 new home sales in January. And while that's a tad below the blowout December 2014 number, it is still 3.7% above the fourth-quarter 2014 average of 458,000 new homes sold. The <span class="companylink">UBS</span> forecast is a tad more conservative; the firm is expecting new home sales of 470,000 for January, which is 2.6% above the three-quarter average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our forecast is nevertheless consistent with an improving trend in new home sales," Harris told clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing, of course, is a key pillar of the U.S. economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales in January also cooled. Sales dipped 4.9% to a seasonally adjusted 4.82 million units, below the 4.95 million homes forecast by economists.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A four-day stock rally that has pushed the major indexes to record closes could get another boost today as the government delivers a pre-Christmas grab bag of economic reports projected to show mostly encouraging gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most prominent is the final estimate of third-quarter economic growth. It's expected to show U.S. gross domestic product expanded at a 4.3% annual rate, up from the previous 3.9% reading, as spending on construction and consumer services likely grew more than first believed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, low gasoline prices and sharper wage growth are projected to lift personal income and spending by a solid 0.5% in November. Recent data on retail sales and outlays for utilities hinted at a broad-based pickup.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A measure of consumer sentiment likely dipped slightly from a preliminary estimate but it is still expected to post its strongest showing since January 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Businesses were likely in a spending mood too, with orders for long-lasting, big-ticket items estimated to have risen 3% last month, largely on a big jump in civilian aircraft orders. Even excluding defense and aircraft, "core" orders -- a proxy for business investment -- are forecast to rise a solid 1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only housing looms as a possible lump of coal. November new- home sales are expected to show a tepid increase to 460,000 at an annual rate as real estate continues a slow recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, if the mix of data comes in as projected, it could bolster a <span class="companylink">Dow</span> that has gained nearly 900 points, or 5.2%, since Wednesday.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A batch of reports Tuesday highlighted an economy whose foundation -- consumer and business spending -- looks solid while pillars such as housing are firming more slowly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. economy grew at a 3.9% annual rate in the third quarter, more rapidly than the 3.5% first estimated, the Commerce Department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy has notched its best six months of growth since 2003, including a 4.6% annualized rate of expansion in the second quarter, after a first-quarter contraction caused largely by severe winter weather.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tumbling gasoline prices have left Americans more discretionary cash, boosting consumer spending by 2.2%, in the three months ended Sept. 30, vs. the 1.8% first estimated and boding well for the holiday sales season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 7.1% rise in business investment was also stronger than initially believed as factories bought new machines to expand capacity stretched near its limits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other factors in the upward revision, such as a surge in defense spending and business stockpiling that slowed less than initially estimated, are unlikely to be repeated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reversals in those areas could hinder growth in the current quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Exports increased more slowly than previously believed, reflecting a stronger dollar that's likely to temper economic growth next year, said Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the economy generally is benefiting from the ability of consumers and businesses to shed debt since the recession ended in 2009, clearing a path for higher spending. Federal, state and local governments also are on better financial footing, causing their aggregate spending to grow solidly in the third quarter after dipping the previous quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists expect growth to slow this quarter but pick up next year as stronger wage growth and low gasoline prices drive consumer spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The U.S. recovery is firmly on track," James Marple, senior economist at TD Economics, wrote in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An index of consumer confidence fell this month, the <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span> said, despite the falling gas prices and a roaring stock market. But several economists noted the measure is still near highs for the recovery and will likely rise further in coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market remains stuck in a slower lane. The S&amp;P/Case- Shiller 20-city index of home prices for September rose 4.9% from a year ago, the smallest year-over-year gain in almost two years. Prices have been decelerating after increasing sharply last year. Tight credit continues to hamper a brisker bounce-back in housing sales and starts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reports slated to be released today are likely to amplify the pattern, economists predict, with personal income and spending rising solidly and business equipment orders advancing modestly. New- home sales, which are up just 1.7% this year, are estimated to have risen just slightly in October.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices continued to rise more slowly in August, turning in their smallest year-over-year gains in nearly two years, a closely followed report out Tuesday shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller 20-City Index of home prices rose 5.6% from August 2013, <span class="companylink">S&amp;P</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's down from a 6.7% gain in July and well below the double- digit annual increases seen in most of 2013 and earlier this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The broader S&amp;P/Case-Shiller National Home Price Index also slowed in August, posting a 5.1% annual gain compared with 5.6% in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Slower rising home prices bode well for the housing market's continuing recovery nearly seven years after the market's historic collapse, economists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greg Bird, an economist with <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics, points to the smaller decline in the national price index than the 20-city index. Price appreciation is slowing most in big cities where gains were sharpest in recent years due to investor demand for foreclosures and distressed properties, Bird says. But prices have been rising slowly all along in markets that didn't see such feverish investor buying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Increasing household formation and restrained home building is a recipe for prices to climb, but gains are likely to be modest over the next couple of years, Bird says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stan Humphries, chief economist of the real estate website Zillow, says the recovery is shifting to a more slow and steady course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In housing, boring is better," he says. "As appreciation cools and more inventory comes on line, buyers will start to gain a more competitive advantage, after years of sellers being in the driver's seat. More sedate home value growth, coupled with interest rates that remain incredibly low, will also help housing stay affordable, which is critical to drawing in the next generation of younger, first-time buyers that had been sitting on the sidelines."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller report shows annual gains fell in 19 of the index's 20 cities in August, with Cleveland being the lone exception. The slowdown was greatest in Las Vegas, where the year- over-year return fell from 12.8% in July to 10.1% in August. Miami, which had a 10.5% annual gain, took the lead away from Las Vegas as the city with the sharpest annual gain. In San Francisco, average prices rose 9% in August -- the first month since November 2012 when the annual increase was measured in single digits.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales last month were the strongest this year, but remained below year-earlier levels for the 11th straight month, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rebounding from an August dip, sales of previously owned homes in September rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.17 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was ahead of the 5.1 million rate forecast by economists surveyed by Action Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Traditional buyers are entering a less competitive market with fewer investors searching for available homes, but may also face a slight decline in choices due to the fact that inventory generally falls heading into the winter," said Lawrence Yun, the NAR's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">September's selling pace was 2.4% higher than August's but 1.7% below a year earlier. Except in the Midwest, sales improved in all regions compared with August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors have been withdrawing from the home-buying market as prices rise and the supply of deeply discounted distressed properties falls. Individual investors bought 14% of homes last month, down from 19% a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But first-time buyers continue to be a weak presence in the home- buying market, remaining at 29% for the third straight month. They've claimed less than a 30% share for 17 of the past 18 months, the Realtors association said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of houses for sale didn't keep up with the faster sales rate. Total inventory fell 1.3% at the end of the month to a 2.3 million homes for sale, a 5.3-month supply at September's sales pace. A six-month supply is considered a balanced market between buyers and sellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price for all housing types covered by the report -- single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops -- was $209,700, 5.6% higher than in September 2013. For single-family homes, the median price was $210,300, up 5.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists say an improving economy and increasing job gains should eventually lead to a stronger housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average U.S. mortgage rates remain near all-time lows. Lenders' average rate on a fixed 30-year mortgage fell to 3.97% last week, slipping below 4% for the first time since June 2013, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>'s survey.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors head into the new trading week a lot less fearful and a lot less poorer -- but still a bit on edge -- after the stock market recouped most of its big losses with a strong rebound rally Friday that capped off another turbulent week on Wall Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while it's impossible to play down the potential headline risk that is still out there, markets this week will instead be focusing on a fresh batch of incoming profit reports from U.S. companies and a rash of new economic data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts estimate that existing home sales rose modestly in September after slipping the previous month and that new home sales moderated after surging to a 61/2-year high in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, inflation is projected to show just a slight rise last month after declining in August as gasoline prices continued to drift downward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The U.S. economy remains strong despite weak global growth," <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span> wrote in a research note. Chief U.S. economist Dean Maki added that falling gasoline prices should boost consumer spending and economic growth this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High-profile companies reporting earnings this week include iPad maker <span class="companylink">Apple</span> and computer giant <span class="companylink">IBM</span> on Monday; fast-food giant <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span> and soft-drink seller <span class="companylink">Coca-Cola</span> on Tuesday; automaker <span class="companylink">General Motors</span> on Wednesday; heavy equipment maker <span class="companylink">Caterpillar</span> and online retailer Amazon on Thursday; and <span class="companylink">Ford Motor</span> and consumer staples behemoth <span class="companylink">Procter &amp; Gamble</span> on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stock market, which for most of last week was trading on fear and emotion in the face of wild stock price gyrations set in motion by a global growth scare and panicky reactions to the Ebola virus scare, showed signs of stabilization Friday. The Dow rallied 263 points to trim its weekly loss to 1%, leaving it down 5.2% from its September record high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market's violent swings the past two weeks "felt worse than it is," mainly because traders had grown unaccustomed to them, says Russ Koesterich, chief investment strategist at Blackrock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I still think you can get massive market swings, but I don't think this is the start of something more dire," says Koesterich, adding that he doesn't think the slowdown in Europe is a "precursor to a global recession."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He adds that Ebola is "incredibly hard to handicap" so you have a "lingering black swan out there."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the upside, a Wall Street "fear gauge" index is also heading back down after it doubled since the end of September to its highest level in three years. And crude oil, which had plunged more than 20% in price before bottoming out around $80 a barrel earlier last week, has suddenly found buyer interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Bechtel, money manager at Barrow Funds, says there is potential for more roller-coaster days on Wall Street but says the volatility "creates opportunities for level-headed people to put money to work."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He's been buying some of his favorite names, including defensive- type stocks such as tobacco giant <span class="companylink">Altria</span> and chicken producer <span class="companylink">Pilgrims Pride</span>, viewing them as "bargains" after they got walloped like the rest of the market in the recent downdraft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked if a bear market is looming, Bechtel responded: "I think that might be stretching things."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home prices in July showed their smallest annual gains since late 2012, according to a closely watched barometer of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller 20-city index shows prices rose 6.7% in July from a year earlier, <span class="companylink">S&amp;P</span> said Tuesday. That's the smallest year-over-year gain since November 2012 and continues a trend of decelerating prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price gains shrank from a year ago in 19 of the 20 cities. Las Vegas, Miami and San Francisco were the only cities with double- digit increases from July 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monthly gains were also smaller than in June in 17 cities. San Francisco prices, among the highest in the nation, actually fell 0.4% in July, the largest amount since February 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite shrinking price gains, home prices are still rising two or three times the rate of inflation, said David Blitzer, chairman of the Index Committee at <span class="companylink">S&amp;P</span><span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> Indices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And moderating prices, while distressing for some sellers, will cheer buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news, said <span class="companylink">IHS</span> Global Insight economists Patrick Newport and Stephanie Karol, is that fundamentals are driving home prices in the majority of cities in the Case-Shiller Index. In May-July period, seasonally adjusted inventories of existing homes grew 5.3% from a year earlier -- the largest gain since 2011, they said in a research note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With job markets gaining strength, that could lead to more home purchases later in the year, Newport and Karol predicted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Las Vegas, one of the hardest-hit housing markets in the recession, continues to lead cities in annual price gains. Prices there were up 12.8% year over year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phoenix, the first city to see double-digit gains as the housing prices started climbing sharply, posted its lowest annual return since February 2012 -- 5.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of July, average home prices are back to autumn 2004 levels, <span class="companylink">S&amp;P</span> said. The Case-Shiller 20-city index has climbed 29.3% from its March 2012 low, but remains more than 16% off its mid-2006 peak.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing has been a drag on Wall Street this week. On Monday, August sales of existing homes came in below forecasts. On Tuesday, an index that tracks the purchase prices of homes also fell shy of estimates. So, if housing is to avoid a sweep, and post three straight losing data points below expectations, August home sales out today at 10 a.m. ET have got to buck the losing trend. Wall Street is expecting new-home sales to rise 4.4% to 430,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent dip in sales of existing homes and a slowdown in home price growth are the latest signs the housing market is cooling off after a solid run spurred by low borrowing costs, strong investor demand and an improving economy that enabled home buyers to come up with cash for down payments and get credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales in August fell 1.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.05 million homes, below the 5.20 million forecast, ending a four-month streak of increases. On Tuesday, the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> said its purchase-only House Price Index rose 0.1% in July compared with June, below the 0.5% price gain Wall Street was betting on. On a year-over-year basis, FHFA home prices rose 4.4%, down from nearly 8% at the end of 2013, says <span class="companylink">Barclays</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The slowdown in the rate of home price appreciation in the FHFA House Price Index in 2014 has mirrored that in other national home price indices and is broadly in line with our outlook for smaller gains in home prices this year," <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> told clients.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you've ever owned rental real estate, you know that the problems can outweigh the benefits. There's taxes and building inspectors.

They aren't cheap, but they're a good way to get some income in these yield-starved days -- and a good portfolio diversifier as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REITs buy and sell commercial properties: apartment buildings, office buildings, shopping malls -- even self-storage complexes. By law, they have to pass nearly all their profits on to shareholders in the form of dividends. For that reason, they tend to have high dividends: Currently an average 3.13% a year for all stock REITs, vs. about 2% for the <span class="companylink">Standard and Poor's</span> 500-stock index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most REIT dividends are fully taxable at ordinary income tax rates, unlike most long-term dividends. Nevertheless, the difference in yields has long been attractive to investors who would like more than the pittance available from money market funds and bank CDs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mutual funds that invest in REITs have another charm, which is that they don't entirely march in lockstep with the S&amp;P 500. Sometimes this is good, as in 2003, when the Lipper Real Estate Fund index rose 32%, vs. an 11% gain for the S&amp;P 500 with dividends reinvested. Sometimes this isn't so good, as in 2013, when the S&amp;P 500 soared 32% and real estate funds swooned 1.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far this year, REIT funds have gained an average 17.9%, vs. 9.5% for the S&amp;P 500. Normally, such a disparity would make you think of REITs as wildly overvalued. "I'd say you would need to look over a two-year period," says Edward Turville, manager of the REMS Real Estate Value Opportunity fund (HLRRX), up 143% the past five years, vs. 121% for the average real estate fund. "The return this year is just re-setting prices back to where they were in May of 2013."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Turville, a value investor, was happier when prices were lower. Currently, he considers the REIT market fairly valued and has let his fund's cash position rise to about 13%, vs. about 5% normally. But that's not to say he thinks the sector is about to collapse. "It's midcycle economics for real estate," he says. "You have high occupancy rates that are getting tighter, and rents rising in every type of real estate, and a supply of new, unleased assets coming on at a rate that's not catching up with demand."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steve Brown, portfolio manager for American Century Real Estate (REACX), generally agrees with that assessment. His fund has gained 18.8% this year. Prices are "reasonable in the long term," he says. "If we continue to get good earnings, the stocks will do fine."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His fund has been stocking up on hotel REITs (as well as hotel stocks, such as <span class="companylink">Hilton (HLT) </span>in part because they are one of the most logical beneficiaries of rising employment. Group business at hotels -- large bookings from groups of eight to massive conventions -- has gained 4.5% this year. Those bookings not only increase occupancy rates, but flow through to earnings from hotel restaurants and bars as well. One favorite: <span class="companylink">Pebblebrook Hotel Trust</span> (PEB), which owns but doesn't operate hotels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another favorite: apartments. "Rents are rising faster than inflation," <span class="companylink">Brown</span> says. The basic case: Even though the housing market is recovering, entry-level housing is sluggish because of slow wage growth and the difficulty of getting a mortgage. And the younger age cohort, those from 22 to 32, is an enormous group at the point in their lives where they are most likely to rent an apartment."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What could go wrong with REITs? Both managers say they expect a rise in interest rates would hurt the group initially. But if rates are rising because the economy is growing -- rather than, say, an effort by the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> to snuff inflation -- then REITs should rebound nicely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Turville likes sell-offs because it means he can get stocks cheap. If REITs sold off, "We're likely to buy into that," he says. "There are a dozen stocks in our portfolio we'd like to own more of if we get more attractive pricing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're a long-term investor, you might consider adding some real estate funds to your portfolio. The top-performing funds are in the chart. But you shouldn't overlook real estate index funds, which ditch the manager and offer rock-bottom expenses -- one of your biggest advantages over the long haul.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Vanguard</span> REIT ETF (VNQ) is the largest of the exchange-traded real estate fund. It charges 0.10% a year in expenses. The fund is up 21.4% this year and yields 2.97%. <span class="companylink">Schwab US REIT ETF</span> (SCHH) charges 0.07% a year in expenses, and has gained 21.6% this year. Yield: 2.25%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Owning a REIT doesn't have the charm and character of, say, owning a brownstone in Brooklyn or a Victorian in Vancouver. On the other hand, you'll never have to fix a faucet. And selling it is always one click away.</p>

</div><div class="author">Paul Davidson   </div><div>Paul Davidson, @PDavidsonusat, USA TODAY</div>
<div>495 words</div><div>4 September 2014</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.2</div><div>English</div><div>© 2014 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. economy expanded at a modest to moderate pace over the past six weeks as a booming auto industry and tourism continued to drive growth, the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pickup in activity was moderate in the New York, Cleveland, Chicago, Minneapolis, Dallas and San Francisco bank districts. Philadelphia, Atlanta, St. Louis and Kansas City reported modest growth. In Boston, "business activity appears to be improving," and Richmond reported further strengthening, the <span class="companylink">Fed</span> said in its "beige book," named for the color of its cover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report, which provides an anecdotal snapshot of the economy, was similar in tone to the previous two and more tempered in its outlook than recent government data that portray an accelerating economy. While that data show manufacturing, job growth and the housing market all picking up momentum lately, the beige book describes activity in those sectors as modest, moderate or mixed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer spending expanded at a "slight to moderate" pace, the <span class="companylink">Fed</span> said, with the exception of auto sales. Growth picked up in Chicago and slowed in Philadelphia, and sales weakened slightly in Atlanta. In Boston and Chicago, shoppers snapped up clothing. Household and home-improvement items were popular in Kansas City and Boston. And back-to-school sales were strong in New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta and Dallas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Auto sales remained a bright spot. In Philadelphia, dealers reported record car sales in July. Purchases of SUVs and pickup trucks increased in the Cleveland, Chicago, Kansas City and San Francisco regions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tourism, meanwhile, accelerated across the country, with hotel occupancy high or rising in the Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta and San Francisco districts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The manufacturing picture was mixed. Growth rates increased in the Cleveland, Richmond and Dallas areas but moderated in the New York, Atlanta, Minneapolis and Kansas City regions. Construction fueled production in the Philadelphia, Chicago, Minneapolis and Kansas City areas. Boston and San Francisco both reported higher demand for semiconductors. Still, optimism about the near-term outlook prevailed across the nation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing also expanded but not uniformly. About half of the districts said new house construction and existing home sales were stable or growing, though the increase in sales was modest. Commercial construction also is picking up in about half of the regions. In Boston, building increased in the hospitality industry, while more industrial and warehouse projects are on tap in Philadelphia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lending generally strengthened across the country, though auto loans drove much of the pickup. "Demand for residential mortgages was less robust," the <span class="companylink">Fed</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And despite 200,000-plus monthly job gains over the past six months, the <span class="companylink">Fed</span> described the labor market and hiring trends as "generally modest." Employers, however, increasingly are struggling to find skilled employees, including technology workers in the Boston area, truck drivers in New York and construction workers in Atlanta.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index's climb to 2000 has been predicated largely on the bet that the U.S. economy, which stalled early in 2014 due to a frigid winter, is gaining momentum and poised for a growth spurt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The easy part for investors is to come up with a money-making thesis. The hard part? Being right and making money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past week or so, the incoming data, for the most part, have been strong. Take last Thursday, when investors witnessed a home run, with four key data points all topping expectations. The "four-for-four" day for economic data beats included better-than- expected July readings on existing home sales and leading economic indicators, a strong manufacturing report from the Philadelphia region and a 14,000 decline in first-time jobless claims applicants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week's data releases aren't too shabby, either. While new- home sales in July came in weak Monday, and home price indexes released Tuesday showed a slowing pace of gains, durable goods climbed a record 22.6% in July and consumer confidence this month hit a post-recession high. The strong data helped fuel the S&amp;P 500's latest rally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Will the good news continue? Investors will find out today. The government will release its updated take on second-quarter GDP, which rose 4% in the first count. Investors will also get fresh looks at July pending home sales and the latest weekly data on the number of new folks lining up for unemployment benefits.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales climbed last month to their fastest pace since September, providing further evidence that the housing market is bouncing back after a sluggish first half of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales rose 2.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.15 million and have increased for four straight months, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Thursday. The total beat analysts' estimates, though sales remain 4.3% below the year-ago level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun attributed the solid sales to growing housing inventories and moderating price increases. Those factors "are giving prospective buyers less hesitation about entering the market," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family home sales increased 2.7% last month, while condominium and co-op sales were unchanged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this week, the government reported that housing starts also increased sharply in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The homes-for-sale inventory rose 3.5% to 2.4 million, which represents a 5.5-month supply. A six-month supply is considered balanced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median home price was $222,900, 4.9% higher than a year ago. Prices are still rising but more slowly than last year's double- digit pace, which ultimately discouraged many buyers from making bids.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is exactly the sort of pattern we want to see," economists Patrick Newport and Stephanie Karol of <span class="companylink">IHS</span> Global Insight said in a research note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market also reached a milestone as the stock of distressed homes -- including foreclosures and short sales -- fell to 9% of all sales, the first time they've slipped to single digits since the Realtors group began tracking the figure in fall 2008. In 2009, troubled sales represented 36% of all sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The share of first-time home buyers rose for the second straight month to 29%, though they remain below the 40% considered normal. First-time buyers have been hampered by more stringent criteria for credit scores and down payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The South led the overall gains, with sales in the region rising 3.4%. Sales increased 2.6% in the West and 1.7% in the Midwest. They were unchanged in the Northeast.</p>

</div><div class="author">Doug Carroll   </div><div>Doug Carroll, USA TODAY</div>
<div>429 words</div><div>20 August 2014</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.1</div><div>English</div><div>© 2014 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home building took off in July as builders broke ground on new homes at their fastest pace of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts rose 15.7% from June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.1 million, the Census Bureau said Tuesday. The previous estimate for June also was revised upward by 52,000 to 945,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">July's home building rate beat economists' median forecast of 965,000 and was the strongest since November. Last month's pace came in ahead of April's 1.06 million rate, the only other month this year when starts' annual rate cracked 1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family home building also increased to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 656,000 -- also the fastest pace this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, building permits, a sign of future construction plans, were issued at a 1.1 million annual rate, the fifth month this year that new permits topped 1 million in a month. Last year, permits averaged 990,000 a month. Permits for single-family homes alone also improved slightly from June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Census' original report said June housing starts were pulled down by a sharp falloff in building in the South, a result that some economists blamed on unusually wet weather. In Tuesday's report, the June numbers were revised upward, and July's starts showed a 29% monthly jump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About half of single-family construction is in the South, where single-family permits have been accelerating the past three months, said <span class="companylink">IHS</span> Global Insight economists Patrick Newport and Stephanie Karol in e-mailed comments after the Census report. "As job and income growth continue to recover, the single-family market should benefit."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the improved numbers, however, the pace of building in the single-family home sector remains a concern, said economist Richard Moody of <span class="companylink">Regions Financial</span>. Permits average 613,000 a month over six months -- a low rate indicating the pace of single-family building will not match even July's rate in coming months, let alone accelerate, he said in a research note Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home building is well off its pace in the years before the housing bust. From 2000 to 2005, monthly housing starts averaged a 1.8 million annual rate, and the rate of single-family building was 1.5 million, according to Census data from <span class="companylink">Haver Analytics</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the growth has been in construction of apartment buildings, rather than single-family homes.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A healthy housing market is pretty much a requirement for the ongoing healing of the U.S. economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's why Monday's upbeat reading on builder confidence in August equated to a major plus. Another upside surprise today, when July data on housing starts will be released, would no doubt add to the bullish sentiment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maury Harris, an economist at <span class="companylink">UBS</span>, is expecting yet another good reading on housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He forecasts July housing starts to jump 9.7% to 980,000 units compared with June, which is higher than the 966,000 new home starts Wall Street is expecting. It's also well above the 893,000 starts in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harris cites a few reasons for his optimism. First, he says the decline in single-family starts in June appear to be exaggerated, as the decline in the South did not jibe with stronger single-family permit activity in the region. Second, he points to Monday's strong reading on the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> housing index, which came in at 55, above the 53 estimate. Finally, he expects a rebound in multifamily starts after a dip in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all of 2014, Harris told clients, we continue to forecast starts of 1.05 million annualized units. In 2015, he said the firm projects 1.25 million units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Says Harris: "We expect low mortgage rates and rising household incomes to support housing activity. Importantly, the <span class="companylink">Fed</span>'s loan officer survey for July indicated easing lending standards and increasing demand."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apartment living brought Bill and Jennifer Schumacher together, with the two neighbors meeting while living at the same apartment complex in the Philadelphia area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Jennifer received a job offer in the Rochester, N.Y., area, the couple were fine with moving, but they didn't have much time, and they knew they didn't want to live in another apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We said, 'There's no way we're going into another apartment' -- we need bigger space; we wanted some ground outside," Jennifer said while in the living room of the 1,900-square-foot Pittsford, N.Y., house they now rent. "This is a perfect opportunity."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate company <span class="companylink">Broadstone Real Estate</span>, based in Rochester, traditionally has focused on commercial properties, ranging from medical offices to retail space but is increasingly diving into the single-family home market, including through the Broadtree Homes line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this month, it announced under its Broadtree Homes shingle that it had purchased 127 single-family homes in the Atlanta area for roughly $10 million. That purchase more than doubled the portfolio of single-family homes it began amassing in late 2012 around Minneapolis, Palm Beach County, Fla., and the Rochester area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big money has in the past been relatively rare in the rental house market. According to an analysis earlier this year on the single-family rental market by New York investment banking firm Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, about half of the nation's 14 million rental homes are owned by individuals who own just one rental property. Only about 2 million are owned by investors with 10 or more properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Renting single-family homes "has always been a mom-and-pop business," said Broadstone CEO Amy Tait.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the number of big real estate companies involved in renting single-family residences is growing. New York-based financial services giant <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group</span> is now the largest landlord of single-family homes, having spent roughly $8 billion over the last two years buying 43,000 homes. California-based <span class="companylink">American Homes 4 Rent</span>, the second-largest such firm, started in 2012 and now owns more than 25,000 homes in 22 states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The financing for investor-owned properties has not been widely available, (and) the investment and lending opportunities are immense and perhaps just beginning," Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods said in the analysis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plummeting home prices in recent years opened the door to the investment opportunity, said Dave Bragg, managing director of the residential research team at Green Street Advisors, a real estate research firm. Meanwhile, the armies of homeowners who saw their residences foreclosed upon still needed housing. "If you're living in a 1,500-square-foot house, you probably picked that for a need for space," Bragg said. "Foreclosure victims didn't really shift into apartments."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Owning your own home was long synonymous with the American dream. But homeownership rates are waning nationally. According to <span class="companylink">U.S. Census Bureau</span> data, the percentage of Americans who own their own home was roughly 65% in the first quarter of this year, the lowest it's been since 1995. The rate peaked in 2006, when 69% of Americans owned their own home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It used to be people thought renting was synonymous with going into an apartment community," Tait said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the financial crisis meant more renters as people lost their homes, plus a glut of foreclosed homes that came onto the market, she said. That, coupled with the fact of technology making it easier than ever to research homes for sale and to manage a portfolio of rental homes, opened the door to big investors looking at big portfolios of homes as an opportunity, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Until the crisis, it really didn't make sense for investors to do this," Tait said. "It's a management-intensive business."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a conference call with Wall Street analysts in May, David Miller, CEO of Minnesota real estate investment trust <span class="companylink">Silver Bay Realty Trust</span>, said the shrinking supply of single-family homes for sale, as well as increasing home-building costs "point to continuing positive trends for future (price growth) and rental demand, all factors which bode well for the demand for single-family rental homes."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since its start in 2012, Silver Bay has purchased, and now owns and rents, about 5,700 single-family homes in eight states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, some worry those deep-pocket buyers are pricing individuals out of the housing market. In March, a group of 80 organizations -- from Neighborhood Housing Services of Greater Cleveland to The Fair Housing Council of San Diego -- wrote an array of federal regulatory agencies, asking for rules or guidance regarding the big investments going on in rental properties. They cited concerns ranging from displacement of homeowners to "the creation of another housing bubble."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That same month, U.S. Rep. Mark Takano, D-Calif., sent letters to the <span class="companylink">U.S. Treasury Department</span>, <span class="companylink">Securities and Exchange Commission</span>, Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the <span class="companylink">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</span> with numerous questions about the single- family rental market and the growth of bonds backed by the rental incomes from those properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the letters, despite low interest rates and purchase prices, families in Southern California and first-time home buyers "are finding it hard to purchase a home. It is increasingly the case that these homes are being purchased by investment companies looking to rent out the property, leaving the family purchaser of modest means shut out of the market. Similar stories are coming out of Florida, Arizona, Nevada and Georgia."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is a new area that's potentially going to grow bigger," Takano said last week. "We have an obligation to try to understand it better -- the financial instruments, the impact on communities, the impact on individual tenants. I'm not wholly comfortable with what I see going on -- aspiring middle-class people being priced out of homes, out of a chance to get an equity stake in property ownership and what I also see as neighborhoods potentially destabilized while Wall Street extracts their cut before they flip and sell these homes."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, the pace of big firms buying houses has slowed in recent months as housing prices have climbed around the nation, Bragg said. Now those firms are more focused on consolidation and buying portfolios of homes from each other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After dipping its toe in the market with the purchase of roughly 100 homes since late 2012, Broadtree Homes has "learned enough to begin to ramp it up," Tait said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to the Atlanta homes purchased earlier this month, Broadtree has 50 more homes under contract in Atlanta. And Broadtree is looking at other portfolios of homes that had been previously snapped up by real estate companies now looking to sell. Tait said Broadtree has been offered well in excess of $1 billion worth of various portfolios as it looks to get more heavily into the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are lots of portfolios out there for sale," Tait said. "It's hard to do this efficiently without a couple hundred, 300 homes in a given market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eventually, the Schumachers plan to buy their own home. But for now, each of their two boys has his own bedroom. Their two dogs get to enjoy a fenced-in backyard.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new single-family homes fell 8.1% in June, and May's previously reported surge was slashed by a record revision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paired with June's slippage, newly updated sales figures for March, April and May show the industry's spring performance was weaker than previously estimated, the Census Bureau reported Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">June sales hit a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 406,000, the second-weakest pace of the year, the Census said. May's level was cut to 442,000 from the 504,000 annual pace the Census reported a month ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of rising nearly 19% from April, May's sales were only up about 8%. The magnitude of the change was a single-month record for new-home sales data, according to Census records on revisions that date to 1996.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists were bracing for lower June sales, but they anticipated an annual rate of 480,000, based on the median forecast by Action Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales fell from May in every region, led by a 20% decline in the Northeast. The falloffs elsewhere were 1.9% in the West, 8.2% in the Midwest and 9.5% in the South.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of homes sold last month was $273,500, up 5.2% from June 2013, but down 3.2% from May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This was a dismal report. Last month's number looked like an outlier, and turned out to have been too good to be true," said <span class="companylink">IHS</span> Global Insight economist Stephanie Karol in a research note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While monthly figures can be volatile, more reliable quarterly averages show the new-home market's weakness. Second-quarter sales were 6.4% below the pace in last year's second quarter, Karol points out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite recent signs of a pickup in the housing market after a rough winter, the pace of its recovery this year has not quickened as economists expected, despite an improving jobs market and mortgage rates that are still near historic lows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales rose 2.6% in June, but are trailing last year's first half. With the revisions in Thursday's report, new- home sales are running about 5% behind a year ago.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you didn't get enough real estate data Monday, you'll get plenty today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monday, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> (NAR) published its existing-homes sales statistics for May, which rose 4.9%. It was the biggest gain since 2011, and a back-to-back increase from April, when sales rose 1.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The figure was good news not only for the housing market, which looked stalled in March, but for the economy in general. When you buy a home, you wind up buying other things: sofas, mowers and lawn flamingos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today will see three more bits of housing information:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> (FHFA) releases its purchase price index at 9 a.m. ET. It was up 0.7% in March. Consensus is for a 0.5% increase in April. Rising home prices make consumers feel wealthier, and more inclined to spend. Soaring house prices, however, indicate bubble behavior -- which was one of the root causes of the 2007-2009 housing crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR releases May existing-home sales at 10 a.m. ET. While existing-home sales are good, new-home sales are even better, at least from an economic perspective. New homes require carpenters, plumbers, architects and others, all good-paying jobs. Consensus is for 441,000 units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Standard and Poor's</span> releases the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller home price index at 9 a.m. ET, which tracks changes in residential real estate in 20 major markets. The consensus forecast is for a 0.8% change from March.</p>

</div><div class="author">Doug Carroll   </div><div>Doug Carroll, USA TODAY</div>
<div>630 words</div><div>24 June 2014</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.1</div><div>English</div><div>© 2014 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales rose for the second-straight month in May, climbing at their strongest pace since fall, as more homes on the market helped draw buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of single-family homes, townhomes, condos and co-ops hit a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.89 million, up 4.9% from April's revised 4.66 million rate, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The monthly percentage gain was the highest since August 2011. Last month's sales rate also beat economists' median forecast of 4.73 million in Action Economics' survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The long-awaited spring bounce in home sales looks to have finally appeared," said RBS Markets chief U.S. economist Michelle Girard in a research note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both sale prices and inventory improved last month, which is a good sign, said Stephanie Karol, of <span class="companylink">IHS</span> Global Insight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As long as sellers feel assured of making a profit, they will feel emboldened to list their homes; and as buyers feel they have a good selection of well-located properties to choose from, they will continue to look and bid," she said in a research note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite sales' improving trend the past two months, they are still weaker than last year. In May 2013, the annualized sales rate was 5.15 million. Through May, sales are down 8.2% from the first five months of last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market also continues to be difficult for buyers with modest financial resources, such as first-time buyers. Their share of sales declined to 27% in May, down 2 percentage points from April and from April 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although single-family home sales rose 5.7% from April, they're down 5.7% from a year ago. Compared with last year, the lower-price end of the market looks weakest. Sales of homes under $100,000 and from $100,000 to $250,000 fell in every region of last month compared with May 2013. But sales of homes priced at $1 million- plus rose everywhere but the Midwest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median existing-home price was $213,400 in May, up 5.1% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, more homes on the market, prices rising more slowly than in 2013 and declines in mortgage rates should create better conditions for buyers, said Lawrence Yun, chief economist of the National Association of Realtors. <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> reported last week that the average for a 30-year mortgage was 4.17%, compared with an average 4.48% last December and 3.93% a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year's interest rate drops are likely to be temporary. Rates are expected to tick up as the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> pares bond purchases it launched in 2012 to hold down long-term interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors group said total housing inventory at the end of May rose 2.2% to 2.28 million existing homes available for sale. That's 6% higher than a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At May's sales rate, there's a 5.6-month supply of homes for sale; a six-month inventory is considered a balanced market between buyers and sellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More data on the housing market is due today when <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> releases the Case-Shiller Index of home prices for April, and the government reports on new-home sales for May.</p>

</div><div class="author">Paul Davidson   </div><div>Paul Davidson, @PDavidsonusat, USA TODAY</div>
<div>1236 words</div><div>30 April 2014</div><div>USA Today (Newspaper)</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.1</div><div>English</div><div>© 2014 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A housing recovery that was expected to accelerate this year is instead sputtering. And no, you can't just blame the weather.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sharp increases in home prices in much of the USA, along with higher mortgage rates, have discouraged many house hunters. Home inventories are at historically low levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time home buyers, who traditionally drive home sales, remain saddled with student debt and face still-stringent lending standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After bouncing back smartly in 2012 and most of 2013 following the 2006-09 real estate crash, the housing market began slowing last fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although an unusually cold and snowy winter hindered activity early this year, home sales and starts were disappointing again in March, even in the West and South.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time buyers Bill and Lauren Mensinger, who rent a one- bedroom loft in Hanover, Mass., have been looking for a three- bedroom house for about a year -- a mission made more urgent by the recent birth of their daughter. With homes for sale in short supply in the Boston area, they've been outbid several times, Bill says, even for houses that needed extensive repairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's draining," says Bill, 37, an architect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thirty-year fixed mortgage rates have risen from 3.4% to 4.33% since the Mensingers began looking. That's forced them to drop their price limit to $315,000 from $330,000. They've also grudgingly agreed to widen their search beyond the reach of Boston's commuter rail line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others aren't even looking. First-time home buyers accounted for 30% of existing home sales in March, vs. a normal 40%, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With student-loan debt topping $1 trillion and wages stagnant, many adults in their 20s and 30s live with parents or roommates. Only 423,000 households were formed in the past 12 months, the Census Bureau said Tuesday, less than half the typical 1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lending standards, despite some easing in recent months, remain tough, especially for "people who don't have good credit scores," says economist Patrick Newport of IHS Global Insight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists still expect the housing market to gain momentum this year as job and wage growth lead to more new households, credit conditions continue to ease, and builders ramp up production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending home sales increased in March for the first time in nine months, and real estate brokers in several regions say sales have been picking up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many analysts now say the housing recovery will take longer than they had projected. "It hasn't come back as quickly," Newport says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He expects housing starts to finally reach 1 million this year for the first time since 2007 -- almost double 2009's level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he doesn't forecast a return to a normal annual rate of 1.5 million until the fourth quarter of 2015, several months later than he had estimated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drop in sales</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, 4.9 million existing homes are expected to be sold this year, about 3% fewer than last year, says Lawrence Yun, chief economist of the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One big reason is rising prices. In February, home prices in 20 large cities were up an average 13% from a year earlier, according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case-Shiller 20-city Index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In metro areas hammered in the housing crash, such as Las Vegas and Los Angeles, prices have soared nearly 20% or more from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of price increases has slowed recently, and U.S. home prices are still 20% below their summer 2006 peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But combined, higher prices and mortgage rates have made home buying 20% more expensive than a year ago, dampening sales, says Jed Kolko, chief economist of Trulia, a real estate website.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In California cities such as San Francisco and San Jose, about 35% of household income is devoted to mortgage payments -- more than the historical average of a third, says Stan Humphries, chief economist of real estate firm Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Affordability looks on par or worse than it has historically in a lot of markets," Humphries says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices have been driven up by a housing inventory that remains skimpy despite moderately improved demand and more jobs. Thirty- seven percent of homeowners can't sell their houses either because they're worth less than what they owe on their mortgages or they don't have enough equity to buy another house, says Zillow's Humphries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also limiting supplies and pushing up prices are fewer distressed properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreclosures and short sales made up 14% of existing home sales in March, vs. nearly 30% two years years ago, Yun says. Investors who snapped up many troubled properties are now playing a smaller role.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, new-home supplies are rising but are still near 50- year lows, says economist Robert Dietz of the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nation's largest home builders have raised prices sharply after enduring thin profit margins after the crash. In a conference call with analysts last week, Richard Dugas, CEO of Pulte Homes, said the company's average $317,000 sale price in the first quarter is up 10% over last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corporate credit research firm GimmeCredit says in a report that the big builders are raising prices despite slowing sales, hurting first-time buyers and underscoring that they "apparently can be relied upon to gorge until the well runs dry."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shortages hurt</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small builders, which make up 75% of the market, have been hindered by tight credit, labor shortages, limited lot availability and rising construction costs, Dietz says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ed Grady, owner of Brady Homes in Bloomington, Ill., built 150 homes a year before the downturn but now puts up 10 to 15.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He says he'd like to turn out 25, but can't get loans for more than five "speculative" houses, which are sold after they're built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A shortage of construction workers means it takes Grady up to five months to build a house, vs. three months normally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tight supplies are falling short of rising demand in Massachusetts, where a thriving tech sector has fueled job gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Buyers are wanting to lock in at very low interest rates and be done with it, because (rates) are creeping up," says Ryan Wilson, a Realtor at Keller Williams in Watertown, Mass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adverse winter weather discouraged some sellers from putting their homes on the market, says Peter Ruffini, president of the Massachusetts Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A bigger problem, he says, is that many homeowners are reluctant to sell because they fear they'll be unable to find a new home. Through March, existing home sales in Massachusetts are down 4.5% vs. a year ago, while median prices are up 10%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Phoenix area, hit hard by the housing crash, is grappling with the opposite problem. Housing supplies are ample, in part because builders have rushed into the retirement mecca since 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with prices up 14% in the past year, buyers got nervous that a new bubble might be forming, says broker Ray Sullivan of Keller Williams in Scottsdale. "People took a step back."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, analysts say better days are coming -- slowly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The housing market will continue to improve" this year, Kolko says, adding, "A normal market is still years away."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market continued to sputter in March as adverse weather, low supplies and higher costs discouraged home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales declined 0.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.59 million, the lowest level since July 2012, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Tuesday. Home sales have fallen in seven of the past eight months. Still, the market was a bit firmer than expected. Economists' median estimate was for an annual sales rate of 4.57 million, according to Action Economics' survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A brutal winter continued to play a role in the weak showing. Although March brought milder temperatures and fewer storms, sales activity largely reflected closings on purchase agreements signed in January and February, says Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist of High Frequency Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other factors are also holding down sales. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is at 4.27%, low by historical standards but up from about 3.4% a year ago. And higher home prices and a tight supply of homes for sale discouraged some buyers, the NAR said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was a a 5.2-month supply of homes last month, up from a five-month supply in February, but six months is normal. Some of the tight inventory is welcome as the housing market recovers from the 2006 crash. Distressed homes, including foreclosures and short sales, accounted for 14% of sales in March, down from 21% a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But tight supplies limit selection and push up prices, crimping sales. The median price of a single-family home was $198,200 last month, up 7.4% from March 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another obstacle is that first-time buyers are making up an unusually low share of purchases -- 30%, down from 40% traditionally -- largely because of strict credit standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some officials say brighter days are ahead. "There are indications that the stringent mortgage underwriting standards are beginning to ease a bit, particularly regarding credit score requirements," says NAR President Steve Brown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, he says, brisk new-home construction will attract current homeowners, creating a bigger supply of existing homes for first- time buyers.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite at least two years of rising prices, the U.S. still has millions of homes worth far less than their unpaid mortgages, a report out Thursday found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those owners may face a long wait before they have equity again, as gains in home prices slip from double-digit rates the past couple of years, says Daren Blomquist, vice president of RealtyTrac, a market research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RealtyTrac reported 9.1 million houses, or 17% of all homes with mortgages, were "seriously underwater" in the first quarter. That means the total loan amount was at least 25% higher than the property's estimated market value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This scar from the housing market crash is healing. The number of seriously underwater homes is nearly 2 million fewer than a year ago and 3.7 million fewer than in the second quarter of 2012, RealtyTrac said. In that quarter, 29% of all homes with mortgages were deeply underwater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Underwater borrowers are a drag on the housing market and the economy. They don't move up to larger homes, and can't get home equity loans for expensive purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's probably one of the things that is contributing to how lackluster housing has looked the last few months," says David Blitzer, head of <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Index Committee, producer of the Case-Shiller home price index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index shows prices have risen at an annual rate of 12% since bottoming in March 2012. But gains have slowed to single-digits in recent months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blomquist says owners of the 9.1 million seriously underwater homes on average owe 68% more than their homes are worth.</p>
