<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve signaled it won’t raise interest rates for the time being, a potential boon for first-time homebuyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason: The low-rate environment increases consumers’ purchasing power. Many prospective homebuyers could afford a more expensive home than they might have thought.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low rates and a strong job market have helped entice homebuyers, even as concerns grow about a slowdown in economic growth. About 8. 3 million to 9. 2 million first-time homebuyers are projected to become homebuyers from 2020 to 2022, according to credit bureau TransUnion. That’s up from 7. 6 million from 2016 to 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyer boon: US home prices rise in August but cool in major markets</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Refinancing rut: Mortgage applications fall as homeowners hit pause on refinancing</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Millennials have been the driving source of first-time homebuyer demand in recent years. As the bulk of that generation enters their 30s next year and more of them get married and have children, they are expected to continue to boost demand, economists said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Low rates are increasing buying power, a great beneficial trend for potential first-time homebuyers, like millennials,” said Mark Fleming, chief economist at First American Financial, a real estate title insurance company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consensus estimates suggest that mortgage rates will hover around current levels next year, Fleming said. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 3. 68% during the week ending Dec. 5, unchanged from the prior week, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> said Thursday. That’s down from 4. 75% a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, it’s a tough housing market for first-time buyers. They face limited supply. Low rates boosted demand among buyers, but supply has fallen as homeowners have fewer incentives to move. Many consumers locked in lower rates in the wake of the financial crisis when borrowing costs were even cheaper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply and demand imbalance has pushed home values higher. U. S. home prices rose 3. 2% in September, up from a 3. 1% gain in August, according to the S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Increased competition for homes will probably continue to weigh on the market next year, experts said. As home prices rise, buying now would probably save more money rather than waiting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Where rates are and where housing prices are, it’s a great time to buy,” said Mat Ishbia, president and chief executive at United Wholesale Mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prospective homeowners should do their research and make sure they’re not purchasing in an overheated market, economists cautioned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Sun Belt, which has typically been a more affordable region when compared with pricier cities in the East or West, led annual gains in September, according to the S&amp;P <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> Case-Shiller 20-City Composite Index. In September, Phoenix led the way with a 6% price increase from a year earlier, followed by Charlotte, North Carolina, and Tampa, Florida, which rose 4. 6% and 4. 5%, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The top five cities that offer potential first-time homebuyers the largest supply of affordable homes, according to First American, are Oklahoma City; Louisville, Kentucky; Memphis, Tennessee; Birmingham, Alabama; and Kansas City, Missouri.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">housing starts are up 3.8% for October</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home building jumped 3.8% in October, a positive sign for the economy as developers anticipate steady demand. The Commerce Department said Tuesday that housing starts reached a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.31 million. Starts for single-family houses were up 2%, largely because of construction in the West and South. Construction of apartment buildings rose 6.8% from the previous month.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices picked up in August but are losing momentum in larger markets, a potential boon for buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">National home prices rose 3. 2% in August, up from 3. 1% in July, according to the S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, some of the largest cities are struggling, which could benefit homebuyers. Prices in the nation’s 10 major cities rose 1. 5%, down from the 1. 6% gain in July. On the index’s 20-city composite, prices were 2% higher, unchanged from July’s gain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing sector — a pillar for the U. S. economy — rebounded this summer following a weak start to the year, helping to ease recession fears. At the same time, lower mortgage rates have given homebuyers a reprieve.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent data, however, has remained mixed. The pace of existing-home sales fell in September after two months of gains, according to the National Association of Realtors. Meanwhile, new-home sales dipped last month, the Commerce Department said. The batch of weaker-than-expected housing data could be temporary, some analysts said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fresh housing data released Tuesday signaled the housing market is continuing to gain strength. Pending home sales, a gauge of purchases before they become final, rose 1. 5% in September, the National Association of Realtors said. Meanwhile, the homeownership rate climbed to 64. 8% in the third quarter, up from 64. 4% a year earlier, the Commerce Department reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve has signaled that it would take a more measured approach to lowering borrowing costs, which could contain the recent drop in mortgage rates. Even so, some experts say that homebuyers will continue to benefit from low rates in the near term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The consumer is in excellent shape,” said Sam Dunlap, senior portfolio manager at <span class="companylink">Angel Oak Capital Advisors</span>. “Concerns about rising home prices have moderated, which should help Americans from an affordability perspective. ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller data offered signs that markets on the West Coast are continuing to slow. Las Vegas dropped from second to eight among the cities in the 20-city composite, falling from a 4. 7% annual gain in July to 3. 3% in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phoenix led the U. S. with an annual home-price increase of 6. 3%. Meanwhile, price gains in the Southeast remained strong. Charlotte, North Carolina; Tampa, Florida and Atlanta, Georgia, were among the cities that saw prices rise 4. 5%, 4. 3% and 4%, respectively.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home sales fall after robust august</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. new home sales fell slightly in September with all regions of the country except the Midwest showing declines.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pricey housing markets like New York City and Los Angeles seem poised to cool down over the next couple of years while more affordable metro areas like Miami and San Antonio could heat up, according to an analysis by research firm <span class="companylink">Natixis</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While many firms forecast home prices, they generally rely on recent trends. The <span class="companylink">Natixis</span> study looked at the supply-and-demand forces that drive prices. If population growth is outpacing housing construction, homes are becoming scarcer, which should push prices higher, <span class="companylink">Natixis</span> says. If the opposite is at work, homes are becoming more plentiful, which should lead to more moderate price increases or declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Typically, there’s a lag of a year or two before the gap between population growth and housing construction affects prices, says Natixis economist Troy Ludtka, who conducted the study. Population growth, he says, is generally tied to an area's economic gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, the housing market has softened the past year now that prices have climbed about 60% since bottoming in 2012. Zillow expects average U. S. home prices to rise to 2. 8% over the next year, a slowdown from a 4. 8% increase the prior 12 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Holiday savings: <span class="companylink">Walmart</span> kicks off shorter holiday shopping season with deals starting Friday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Despite this, some cities seem to be pointing upward,” says Ludtka.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While cities like Miami and New York could see a shift in momentum, recent trends should persist in other areas. For example, in some markets that have low housing supplies relative to population growth, that gap is widening, likely pushing prices higher, the study found. Those include Dallas-Fort Worth, San Antonio, Houston and Washington D. C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other areas where lots of homes have been built relative to population gains -- such as Cleveland; Tucson, Arizona; and Kansas City, Missouri – the divide is widening, likely tempering price increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What housing markets could get pricey?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here’s a look at the five top metro areas where housing is becoming scarcer and home prices could be headed higher:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">San Antonio, Texas</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s among the nation’s fastest-growing economies and the housing stock isn’t keeping up, Ludtka says. The population climbed 0. 31% faster than home supplies over the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tampa, Florida</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the most vibrant economies in the southeast, Tampa is home to a variety of service and defense-related companies. The population is growing 0. 25% faster than new housing, according to <span class="companylink">Natixis</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Miami</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The center for entertainment and commerce has seen prices moderate, rising 0. 8% the past year, according to Zillow. But the <span class="companylink">Natixis</span> study suggests that could shift, with home construction trailing population gains by 0. 24%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oklahoma City</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aerospace, agriculture and energy underpin a healthy economy. The population is growing 0. 22% faster than new housing.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The technology and government center is getting a further boost with the arrival of Amazon’s second U. S. headquarters in northern Virginia. But regulations have limited new home construction, leaving housing gains trailing population growth by 0. 2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What housing markets could get cheaper?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are the top five markets where housing is becoming more available and home prices could rise more slowly or fall:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cleveland</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The former manufacturing stronghold has transformed itself into a biomedical hub but, like other older northern cities, has lost population. There were 0. 54% more housing units than people added to the area the past year (including the effects of a drop in population).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Detroit</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Motor City is in a similar situation, and its population has declined for decades. The drop in population puts it 0. 5% behind the rise in new home supplies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">El Paso, Texas</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gateway from Mexico to the U. S. is ranked second among metro areas where housing is scarce but that’s changing as housing construction catches up to population gains. Housing growth is outpacing the change in population by 0. 42%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chicago</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although it has one of the world’s largest economies, its population has been shrinking and trails housing gains by 0. 36%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Memphis</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city has suffered in comparison to Nashville, its vibrant, in-state rival, and its population has declined, putting it 0. 34% behind the increase in the housing stock.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kjara Smith, 30, dreamed of buying a home in Centennial Hills, a manicured Las Vegas suburb brimming with shops, restaurants and parks where she had been living with her aunt and other relatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her vision could have become reality several years ago, before area home prices skyrocketed. Instead, early this year, Smith lowered her sights and purchased a more modest home in a scruffy, older neighborhood in northeastern Las Vegas where crime is prevalent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It wasn’t ideal,” she says, adding that she bought a burglar alarm and got a gun as a gift. “For right now, it’s my starter home. I’m making it work for what it is… I needed to find something to get in the game. ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sharp rise in home prices since the housing market bottomed in 2012 has made homes less affordable for most Americans, but the run-up has especially affected African Americans, like Smith, whose typical incomes have climbed more modestly.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Key tax deadline Oct. 15: Did you ask for a federal tax extension in April?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median-income black household could afford just 25% of U. S. homes on the market last year, down from 39% in 2012, according to data provided exclusively to USA TODAY by real estate brokerage Redfin and based on the 46 largest markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, median-income white households could afford 57% of homes for sale last year, down from 69% seven years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why more homes are out of reach</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“African Americans who haven’t been able to buy a home since the recovery began have only seen prices rise further and further out of budget,” says Daryl Fairweather, Redfin's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Redfin determined affordability based on the median incomes of white and black households and average mortgage rates of 3. 35% in 2012 and 4. 54% in 2018. The real estate firm assumed homebuyers make a 20% down payment, though many put down far less, a scenario that would further limit affordability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in the 46 major markets have jumped 70% since 2012 as the improving economy boosted demand, Redfin data shows. Also, builders largely have put up more expensive houses as they seek to offset rising land, labor and materials costs, Fairweather says. The scarcity of lower-priced starter homes has driven their prices higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'29 crash redux?: The stock market crash of 1929 was 90 years ago. Could it happen again?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend has kept some African Americans from buying a home at all while nudging many others to less desirable neighborhoods or remote suburbs that mean longer commutes to work. It also has widened the wealth gap between white and black households, especially since a disproportionate share of black wealth is in homeownership, according to the Urban Institute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“it will mean they have less housing wealth by the time they retire,” says Jung Hyun Choi, a research associate at the Urban Institute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where black households struggle the most to afford homes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the 46 largest markets Redfin tracked, the Las Vegas area experienced the most dramatic decline, with just 14. 7% of homes affordable to the typical black household last year, down from 61. 2% in 2012. Las Vegas area home prices have soared 81% over the past seven years, the most among the 46 metro areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orlando, Florida; Riverside, California and Phoenix, Arizona also notched big drops of at least 30 percentage points in the share of homes affordable to black people. Meanwhile, the California cities of San Jose, San Francisco, San Diego and Los Angeles are the most financially out of reach, with African Americans able to afford just 0. 3% to 1. 3% of homes in those markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Black unemployment reached an all-time low of 5. 5% last month, though that’s still well above the overall 3. 5% U. S. jobless rate. Yet many black people are getting lower-paying jobs that don’t allow them to boost their standard of living, according to a report this month by the <span class="companylink">Brookings Institution</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while African Americans’ income has risen, it hasn’t kept pace with the climb in home prices – or white incomes. From 2012 to 2018, the median household income of black people increased 12. 8% to $41,361, while the median income for white people rose 13. 1% to $70,642, according to the <span class="companylink">U. S. Census Bureau</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’re making less and home prices are going up constantly,” says Donnell Williams, owner of Destiny Realty in Morristown, New Jersey, and president of the National Association of Real Estate Brokers, a trade group for black real estate professionals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Black homeownership declines faster</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The share of African Americans who own their homes fell from 43. 8% in early 2012 to 40. 6% in the second quarter, according to the <span class="companylink">U. S. Census Bureau</span>. By contrast, the white homeownership rate has edged down slightly, from 73. 5% to 73. 1%. In 2004, during the housing boom, nearly half of black people owned their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are other factors besides income that have squeezed black people out of homeownership. From 2007 to 2009, nearly 8% of African Americans lost their homes to foreclosure, compared with 4. 5% of whites, according to the <span class="companylink">Center for Responsible Lending</span>. Many have been replenishing savings and repairing their credit, Williams says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, black people are less likely than white people to receive a gift from a friend or relative to help with the down payment and twice as likely to have student debt that could constrain their ability to obtain a mortgage, says Jessica Lautz, vice president of demographics and behavioral insights for the National <span class="companylink">Association of Realtors (NAR)</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">African Americans also have far lower credit scores than whites, a disparity that is more severely hindering homeownership now that mortgage lenders have tightened standards as the economy slows, Choi says. Yet such benchmarks may unfairly hurt blacks, who are less likely to have mainstream credit. She recommends that lenders place more emphasis on measures such as rental payment history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides lower homeownership, the Redfin data underscores that the growing disparity between home prices and black people's incomes is nudging African American buyers to cheaper homes in more marginal neighborhoods. That can mean less access to better jobs and high-quality schools for their children, Fairweather says. Black people bought a median-priced home of $210,000 last year, compared with $250,000 for whites, Lautz says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has compounded another problem. While the 1968 Fair Housing Act outlawed blatant discrimination, more subtle incidents of real estate agents steering black buyers away from mostly white neighborhoods have increased significantly since 1999, according to an NAR report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Las Vegas median prices soar</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smith, the Las Vegas homebuyer, was looking for a house in the $180,000 to $189,000 range but found slim pickings in the area, where the median price has leaped from $159,000 to $289,000 since 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So she bought a two-bedroom, two-story frame house for $167,000, making a 3% down payment through a <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span> loan and receiving aid for half that cost through a federal program. She has spent a few thousand dollars more to replace damaged walls and fixtures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A patient accounts coordinator for a healthcare provider, Smith plans to upgrade to a better house after she earns a degree that will pave the way for a higher salary. But she worries that her home won’t appreciate as much as units in better neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s hard to sell in the area I live in,” she says. Houses in segregated areas have not risen in value at the same pace as those in predominately white areas, according to the <span class="companylink">Center for American Progress</span>.</p>

Naim Vandross, 26, of Newark, New Jersey, has been searching for a two- or three-family house for himself and his three-year-old daughter for eight months, with the aim of renting out a couple of the units to provide income. Vandross, a car service adviser, has been putting away $700 to $900 a month for a down payment. But with a price cap of $400,000, Vandross has lost out in bidding wars for five houses.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kjara Smith, 30, dreamed of buying a home in Centennial Hills, a manicured Las Vegas suburb brimming with shops, restaurants and parks where she had been living with her aunt and other relatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">25% of U.S. homes on the market last year were affordable for median-income black households, down from 39% in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">57% of homes for sale were affordable for median-income white households last year, down from 69% in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">5.5% of African Americans are unemployed. 3.5% of Americans overall are jobless.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her vision could have become reality several years ago, before area home prices skyrocketed. Instead, early this year, Smith lowered her sights and purchased a more modest home in a scruffy, older neighborhood in northeastern Las Vegas where crime is prevalent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It wasn't ideal," she says, adding that she bought a burglar alarm and got a gun as a gift. "For right now, it's my starter home. I'm making it work for what it is… I needed to find something to get in the game."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sharp rise in home prices since the housing market bottomed in 2012 has made homes less affordable for most Americans, but the run-up has especially affected African Americans, like Smith, whose typical incomes have climbed more modestly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median-income black household could afford just 25% of U.S. homes on the market last year, down from 39% in 2012, according to data provided exclusively to <span class="companylink">USA TODAY</span> by real estate brokerage Redfin and based on the 46 largest markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, median-income white households could afford 57% of homes for sale last year, down from 69% seven years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More homes are out of reach</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"African Americans who haven't been able to buy a home since the recovery began have only seen prices rise further and further out of budget," says Daryl Fairweather, Redfin's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Redfin determined affordability based on the median incomes of white and black households and average mortgage rates of 3.35% in 2012 and 4.54% in 2018. The real estate firm assumed homebuyers make a 20% down payment, though many put down far less, a scenario that would further limit affordability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in the 46 major markets have jumped 70% since 2012 as the improving economy boosted demand, Redfin data shows. Also, builders largely have put up more expensive houses as they seek to offset rising land, labor and materials costs, Fairweather says. The scarcity of lower-priced starter homes has driven their prices higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend has kept some African Americans from buying a home at all while nudging many others to less desirable neighborhoods or remote suburbs that mean longer commutes to work. It also has widened the wealth gap between white and black households, especially since a disproportionate share of black wealth is in homeownership, according to the Urban Institute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"it will mean they have less housing wealth by the time they retire," says Jung Hyun Choi, a research associate at the Urban Institute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where black households struggle the most to afford homes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the 46 largest markets Redfin tracked, the Las Vegas area experienced the most dramatic decline, with just 14.7% of homes affordable to the typical black household last year, down from 61.2% in 2012. Las Vegas area home prices have soared 81% over the past seven years, the most among the 46 metro areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Black unemployment reached an all-time low of 5.5% last month, still well above the overall 3.5% U.S. jobless rate. Yet many black people are getting lower-paying jobs that don't allow them to boost their standard of living, according to the <span class="companylink">Brookings Institution</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while African Americans' income has risen, it hasn't kept pace with the climb in home prices – or white incomes. From 2012 to 2018, the median household income of black people increased 12.8% to $41,361, while the median income for white people rose 13.1% to $70,642, according to the <span class="companylink">U.S. Census Bureau</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Black homeownership drops</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The share of African Americans who own their homes fell from 43.8% in early 2012 to 40.6% in the second quarter, according to the <span class="companylink">U.S. Census Bureau</span>.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thanks to rising family incomes, low mortgage rates and older millennials, home prices in the U.S. are projected to rise through July 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's according to a report released Wednesday by the real-estate data firm <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>. The property information provider forecasts annual price growth of 5.4% by July 2020 despite major housing markets experiencing declines across the U.S. in much of 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With the for-sale inventory remaining low in many markets, the pick-up in buying has nudged price growth up," said Frank Nothaft, chief economist at <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>. "If low interest rates and rising income continue, then we expect home-price growth will strengthen over the coming year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The optimistic housing market outlook comes on the heels of an August index report by the S&amp;P <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> Case-Shiller which showed home prices rising at the slowest pace since 2012.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Although the rise in home prices has slowed over the past several months, we see a reacceleration over the next year to just over 5% on an annualized basis," said Frank Martell, president and CEO of CoreLogic.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">manufacturing index at its lowest since 2016</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. factory activity shrank in August for the first time since August 2016, a sign that the trade war with China is weighing down a crucial sector of the economy. The <span class="companylink">Institute for Supply Management</span>, an association of purchasing managers, said Tuesday that its manufacturing index slid to 49.1 last month, from 51.2 in July.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">construction spending ekes out gain in july</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. construction spending ticked up just 0.1% in July, aided by government spending on schools, sewers and the water supply. The Commerce Department said Tuesday that spending on construction projects in July occurred at a seasonally adjusted annual pace of $1.29 trillion.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales are hurting. Even with lower mortgages rates and a sales pick-up in July, purchases of homes are still down significantly compared with 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while analysts typically blame high prices and growing worries about a possible recession, another factor also is playing a prominent role: Foreign buyers, particularly the Chinese, have pulled back sharply from the U.S. real estate market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign investors purchased $77.9 billion in residential property in the 12 months ending in March, down 36% from the previous 12-month period, the National Association of Realtors said in a recent report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China, meanwhile, topped all other countries for the seventh consecutive year, with $13.4 billion in home purchases, but that was down a whopping 56% from the previous year, <span class="companylink">NAR</span> said. About half those sales were all cash, down from 58% a year earlier. The next largest international buyers – Canada, India and the United Kingdom – also had big drops, but they represent smaller shares of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The magnitude of (China's) decline is quite striking, implying less confidence in owning a property in the U.S.," says Lawrence Yun, chief economist of NAR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All told, existing U.S. home sales are down about 3% so far this year from the same period in 2018 despite a 2.5% increase in July from the previous month, <span class="companylink">NAR</span> figures show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A big reason Chinese investors are retreating from the American housing market is that Beijing has placed tight limits on how much capital can leave the country in the wake of a devaluation in the yuan a few years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In China, each family member has been restricted to $50,000 or less," says Steven Ho, senior loan officer at Quontic, a New York City-based bank.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government toughened capital controls last year as the Chinese economy weakened, Ho says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, China's slowing economy itself has dampened the confidence and purchasing appetite of Chinese buyers, Yun says. The Trump administration's trade war with China, he says, has further chilled investment in U.S. housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, more Chinese homeowners have been selling their American houses and condos because they can't pay the maintenance costs with their money trapped in China, says Jeff Lu, vice president of Fidelity National Title Insurance Company.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales perked up in July, a report this week showed, but they're still down significantly so far this year compared with 2018, even with lower mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While analysts typically blame high prices and growing worries about a possible recession, another factor is also playing a prominent role: Foreign buyers, particularly the Chinese, have pulled back sharply from the U. S. real estate market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign investors purchased $77. 9 billion in residential property in the 12 months ending in March, down 36% from the previous 12-month period, the National Association of Realtors said in a recent report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What could the next recession feel like: Stories from past downturns are a guide</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trade war escalates: China retaliates against the US with tariffs on $75B worth of American goods</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China, meanwhile, topped all other countries for the seventh consecutive year, with $13. 4 billion in home purchases, but that was down a whopping 56% from the prior year, NAR said. About half those sales were all-cash, down from 58% a year earlier. The next largest international buyers – Canada, India and the United Kingdom – also had big drops, but they represent smaller shares of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The magnitude of (China's) decline is quite striking, implying less confidence in owning a property in the U. S. ,” says Lawrence Yun, chief economist of NAR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All told, existing U. S. home sales are down about 3% so far this year from the same period in 2018 despite a 2. 5% increase in July from the prior month, NAR figures show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A big reason Chinese investors are retreating from the American housing market is that Beijing has placed tight limits on how much capital can leave the country in the wake of a devaluation in the yuan a few years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In China, each family member has been restricted to $50,000 or less,” says Steven Ho, senior loan officer at Quontic, a New York City-based bank. That makes it tougher for Chinese investors to elbow out American buyers with all-cash offers. “A few years before, these restrictions were not so stringent. ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government toughened capital controls last year as the Chinese economy weakened, Ho says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, China's slowing economy itself has dampened the confidence and purchasing appetite of Chinese buyers, Yun says. The Trump administration's trade war with China, he says, has further chilled investment in U. S. housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, more Chinese homeowners have been selling their American houses and condos because they can’t pay the maintenance costs with their money trapped in China, says Jeff Lu, vice president of Fidelity National Title Insurance Company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California feeling the effects</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California is the epicenter of Chinese residential investment in the U. S. , with 34% of purchases in the state. Other significant hubs are New York, New Jersey, Florida and Texas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Irvine, population 280,000, “There are 65,000 houses. . . and 21,000 of them are owned by Chinese. ” Lu of Fidelity National says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s normal for Chinese buyers to raise the price aggressively," says Phil Lee, a broker at Keller Williams in Irvine. "For example, a $1. 2 million house, they pay $1. 22 million, all in cash. ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, Chinese investors made about half of all home purchases in the city but that share has fallen to about 36% in 2019, Lu says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pullback is depressing prices. In the first half of the year, the median home sale price in Irvine fell to $820,000 from $834,000, according to Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s good news for local Americans who are looking to buy a home – larger supply and less competitors,” Lu added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the wealthy leave market</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop-off in Chinese investors has especially affected the upper end of the market. After decades of economic growth, China has created a class of nouveau riche, many of whom want to buy U. S. homes as a solid investment or as a home for their children who attend American colleges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The wealthy Chinese see the U. S. as a safe harbor to park their money, and also an ideal place for their children’s education,” says Lin Pan, the founder of Lin Pan Realty Group, a Chinese real estate brokerage in Long Island, New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The first batch of Chinese who came into the American housing market were entertainment stars, and then high-level Chinese officials and their families, businessmen and middle-class families,” says Chole Ren, an independent real estate broker in New York City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They specifically fly over here to view the houses,” says Xiang Jill Ji, a broker with Douglas Elliman Real Estate in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The condos in midtown Manhattan used to be one of their favorite choices because they’re brand new, with the best view and positive valued-added space,” Ji said. But at a recent open house, few Chinese shoppers showed up, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More turn to mortgages</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With China's limits on cash that can leave the country, Chinese buyers are now searching for lower-priced homes and using mortgages more often. The share of their home purchases that rely on mortgages has risen to 46% in the 12 months ending in March, from 37% the prior year, according to NAR. And more of the buyers are middle-class.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chinese buyers are also downsizing. Ji has a Chinese client who wanted to buy a two-bedroom condo in Manhattan earlier this year but is now looking for a one-bedroom or studio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, brokers are seeing a growing number of home buyers from Hong Kong due to the political crisis in the city, New York brokers Pan and Ji say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Hong Kong buyers could be the next source of growth,” Pan says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new single-family houses fell 6. 9% in April, but March's total was revised up to a post-recession high, painting a generally favorable outlook for the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 673,000 last month, down from a 12-year high of 723,000 in March. The April figure was till 7% above the total a year ago, the Commerce Department said Thursday. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expected a 675,000 annual sales pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price of new houses was $342,200, up 5% from March and 8. 8% from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A big drop in mortgage rates didn’t boost new home sales. The average rate for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage fell to 4. 14% in April from 4. 27% in March, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. The average rate in 2018 was 4. 54%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales also have been sluggish, dipping 0. 4% last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Broadly, low housing supplies and high prices have constrained sales. Builders face shortages of workers and lots that have pushed up their costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But new home sales, which represent about 10% of the housing market, turned in a strong first quarter before April's pullback and analysts are looking for a solid performance the rest of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The underlying trend in sales remains strong," says Zillow economic analyst Matthew Speakman. "Builders are finding ways to deliver homes despite expensive land and labor prices, a boon to buyers thirsty for more supply. "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts: regained momentum, rising 5. 7% in April</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales: fall again despite lower mortgage rates</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U. S. home construction picked up momentum in April. Housing starts rose 5. 7% last month to a seasonally-adjusted rate of 1. 2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We could see further improvement in new construction over the next year as home building still remains behind population and job growth in most areas. ” Said Danielle Hale, chief economist for realtor. com. “Strength in orders has already boosted builder confidence, as well as new construction. ”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amazon delivered a different kind of Christmas present to homeowners in Arlington, Virginia: an early spring home-buying season that’s setting housing prices ablaze.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company’s November announcement that it picked the Crystal City area of Arlington for its second headquarters, or HQ2, has driven area home prices substantially higher in just a few months, according to Redfin and Realtor. com. The market is likely to heat up further as the spring sales season draws near.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Amazon’s recent bombshell that it’s scuttling plans to locate half of HQ2 in Queens, New York, because of local political opposition has only intensified buyer interest in Arlington, says Redfin broker Brian McMahon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hot market is a boon for home sellers but is hurting buyers, especially those seeking low-priced starter homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price surge is defying a national housing market that cooled in the second half of 2018 amid rising mortgage rates and tight inventory. Home sales across the country are expected to be down slightly this spring shopping season from a year ago. But the market should pick up steam later in 2019 as a result of moderating rates, more plentiful supplies and rising wages, says Lawrence Yun, chief economist of the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sandwich by your finances?Middle-aged Americans fall short on savings</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher mortgage rates and limited inventory made for listless home sales in Arlington in the months leading up to the Amazon news, McMahon says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It started to slide into a funk in late summer, early fall,” he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amazon’s announcement that it’s bringing 25,000 to 38,000 jobs to the Crystal City area over the next dozen years – with an initial 400 coming later this year – was an adrenaline shot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jessica and Joel Sackett had ditched plans to put their two-bedroom condo on the market last summer after McMahon told them it wouldn’t fetch more than $575,000, marginally above what they paid for it 2 ½ years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after the Amazon news, “We said let’s try it,” Joel, 35, says. “We’re only two metro stops away from Crystal City. “</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within 24 hours of listing their Old Town, Alexandria, condo at $600,000 in early December, they had an offer for $606,000. “I was ecstatic,” Joel says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although that deal fell through in early January, the couple immediately relisted the unit and got a $600,000 offer, again within 24 hours. The closing was Monday, with the Sacketts moving to a larger townhouse in Alexandria.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sellers across Arlington are reaping even bigger gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From October to January, the median home sale price in the county rose 11 percent from $545,000 to $605,000, according to Redfin’s analysis of Multiple Listing Service data. Both Redfin and Realtor. com officials largely attribute the price jump to Amazon. Homes in the larger Washington D. C. metro area dipped 3. 8 percent during that period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the number of homes sold in Arlington was up 24. 8 percent in December from a year earlier and 18. 2 percent in January. That reverses the historical trend: Typically, sales and prices tumble through the winter months. In the October-December period a year ago, county home prices fell 13. 7 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crystal City and surrounding areas are also benefiting. From October to December, median home sale prices in those communities increased 8. 1 percent, compared to a 0. 8 percent dip a year earlier, according to Realtor. com. Some buyers looking to move to the area are trying to snag a home before prices skyrocket, says Realtor. com Chief Economist Danielle Hale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many investors, meanwhile, aim to turn a quick profit or rent out units at high rates, McMahon says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers “are calling and saying, ‘We saw what happened in the Seattle area and we think the same thing will take place in the Crystal City area,’” says Virginia Smith, president of Arlington Realty in Crystal City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seattle area home prices have climbed 60. 7 percent the past five years, partly because of growth at Amazon’s current headquarters and other tech companies, says Zillow senior economist Aaron Terrazas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Crystal City, office rents are also feeling the Amazon effect. Asking rates rose 69 cents in the fourth quarter to $37. 33 per square foot annually, largely because of Amazon, according to CBRE.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amazon would not comment on the rising real estate prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many homeowners, meanwhile, are biding their time and hoping for a bigger payday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They’re holding off from listing and waiting to see what’s going to happen” when Amazon employees begin moving into the area later this year, McMahon says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That, he says, helps explain why Arlington’s housing inventory was down 30 percent to 40 percent from a year earlier from November through January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If a flood of eager house hunters collides with wary homeowners, it could make for a less active spring selling season that drives prices even higher, McMahon says. Yet Hale and McMahon are betting more homeowners will list their houses this spring as demand and prices rise, providing some relief to buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As costs increase, though, shoppers seeking entry-level homes “will likely find themselves suddenly priced out of the area,” Hale says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. companies in April added the most jobs in nine months, a sign that hiring remains strong amid solid economic growth. Payroll processor ADP said Wednesday that businesses hired 275,000 people last month, up from just 151,000 in March.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction spending dropped in March or the first time in four months, and spending on home construction fell to the lowest level in more than two years. The Commerce Department says construction spending – including housing, nonresidential and government building projects – fell 0.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.28trillion after rising 0.7% in both January and February. Residential construction spending skidded 1.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $500.9billion, lowest since December 2016. Public construction dropped 1.3% to $320.7billion.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new U. S. single-family homes climbed 4. 5% in March, reaching a 16-month high, as falling mortgage rates and prices and stronger wage gains bolstered demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home were sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 692,000 last month, up from 662,000 in February and 3% above the total a year ago, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price of a new home was $302,700, down 9. 7 percent from a year ago and the lowest level since February 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This trend supports the fact that lower mortgage rates have started to entice buyers this spring and foreshadows a potential strengthening of pending and existing homes sales in the months to come. ” says Danielle Hale, chief economist of realtor. com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 30-year fixed mortgage rate was at 4. 17% last week, down from 4. 94% in November. And average annual wage gains have topped 3% in recent months, according to the Labor Department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Sales undershot last fall, partly due to severe weather, but after three straight increases they are now back in line," Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a research note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were 344,000 new homes on the market last month. At March's sales pace it would take 6. 0 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, down from 6. 1 months in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales climbed 17. 6% in the Midwest, 3. 6% South and 6. 7% in the West but tumbled 22. 2% in the Northeast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report is a bright spot for a housing market that has generally struggled this year. Data earlier this week showed existing home sales fell nearly 5% in March.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the median asking price for a U. S. home hit a record $300,000 in March, not all housing markets are seeing the same boost, according to data from Realtor. com</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asking prices are falling in many metro areas where housing values were once running away. For example, the median list price in San Jose, California, was $1,100,050 in March. That’s the highest asking price of 500 U. S. metro areas, but it’s 11. 6% lower than last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median list prices in Denver and Boulder, Colorado – once-hot markets – also showed similar drops. The worst decline was in Lynchburg, Virginia, where the median ask price plummeted 37% year-over-year to $145,000.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June, Natalee King and her husband, Jonathan, realized a decade-long dream of buying a home in Orange County, California, one of the more expensive housing markets in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple drained their savings for a down payment to win the fixer-upper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But concerned about the cost of future repairs and compelled to rebuild their savings, they decided to rent out the master bedroom with its own bathroom for $1,250. From September through January, two college students on internships leased the space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That rent money gave the Kings a bit of relief, and they're looking for more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They just signed another renter who is expected to move in at the end of the month. They plan to rent for at least a year to steady their finances as Jonathan goes back to school for a career change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Unless you were gifted money, the only way to own a home if you’re middle income is you have to rent," Natalee, 35, said. "We see it all the time. Some people may think it’s weird, but I feel like, in Orange County, it’s the norm now to have that American Dream. ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More money: Where's my paycheck? <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> customers say direct deposits not showing up after outage</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is this normal?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kings are part of a small, but now seemingly permanent, trend of married couples taking in roommates to defray high housing costs, according to a new study from <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> given exclusively to USA TODAY.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More married couples turned to this arrangement as home prices peaked right before the housing crash. They largely stuck with it through the Great Recession and even as the economy bounced back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scam alert: Latest Social Security scam call makes you out to be the criminal. How to avoid falling for it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The thing is home prices keep going up and up, while wages remained flat. So, it makes sense that people are having a tough time with housing costs, even as the economy has gotten better,” said Cheryl Young, a senior economist at <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The percentage of renting and home-owning married couples with roommates is now 28 percent higher than its historical average between 1995 and 2018, <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> found. The increase is led by more married homeowners taking on roommates, which is 38 percent higher than its historical average, <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The share of married renters with roommates is up just 11 percent over the historical average, but these couples are almost three times more likely to have a roommate.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Trulia</span> found that West Coast markets have a higher share of this unique housing arrangement, likely because they have had some of the fastest home price growth over the last decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There is clear correlation between high home prices and rates of married couples with roommates,” Young said. For every $100,000 increase in median metro home prices, there is a 0. 25 percentage point increase in the rate of married couples living with roommates, <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Owning in Oakland</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Oakland, California, Katy Liang, her husband and their two children have been living with a family friend for the past three-and-a-half years since they bought their three-bedroom house for $1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We decided to get a roommate because the mortgage is a lot, and we're a house of two teachers,” Katy, 34, said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their roommate – a friend of her husband – pays $900 each month to rent out the master bedroom with its own bathroom. The rent makes up one-fifth of the total $4,400 monthly mortgage payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The arrangement has been smooth, Liang said. The roommate doesn’t use the kitchen much and instead relies on a hot plate, microwave and mini fridge in his room. But he joins the family sometimes for holiday celebrations and will play with the kids outside.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Liang originally thought he’d move out after they had their second child, who’s 7 months old now. “But we feel like we have enough space still for our family,” she said. “Maybe when the kids need their own room, another three years maybe. ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sharing in Seattle</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Michelle Hardies switched careers, she and her husband, Don, wanted extra income while she built up her new business as a real estate agent. Don, who had lived with the same boarder for 12 years with his ex-wife, suggested a roommate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their home – a four-bedroom house in Lake Stevens, Washington – was big enough and ideally located about a 20-minute drive from Everett, where <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> has a major facility, and 30 minutes from northern Seattle, where rents are becoming unaffordable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s not possible for people to rent on one income in Seattle,” Don, 58, said. “People are being forced to move further and further out of the city to afford to rent or buy. ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past 10 months, they’ve had success renting two rooms on a month-to-month basis, largely to shorter-term boarders. There have been some issues. Two roommates were asked to move out, and another unexpectedly passed away while on vacation. Otherwise, the Hardies – who married two years ago – have been pleased with the arrangement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You have to give up some privacy,” Michelle, 50, said. “As a couple you might not do some of the things you would normally do as a couple – as newlyweds. ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Wink, wink, nod, nod,” Don added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In this case, we don’t want anything too long-term,” Don continued. “We want to go back to no roommates, that’s preferred for us. But for now, it makes economic sense. ”</p>

</div><div class="author">Janna Herron </div><div>1114 words</div><div>17 April 2019</div><div>USA Today Online</div><div>USATONL</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2019 USA Today Online. Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All rights reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forget fevered bidding wars and snap home-buying decisions. Slower and steadier will characterize next year's housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That follows a 2018 that started off hot but softened into the fall as buyers – put off by high prices and few choices – sat out rather than paid up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Affordability issues will remain a top concern going into 2019, exacerbated by rising mortgage rates. But some of 2018's more intractable issues will begin to loosen up. The volume of for-sale homes is expected to rise and diversify, while the number of buyers is forecast to shrink.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For home sellers, they need to recognize those days of frenzied market are over. They must price competitively to sell their home," said Lawrence Yun, the chief economist at the National Association of Realtors. "For buyers, there will be challenges when it comes to rising interest rates, but they don't have to make hurried decisions anymore. "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some cash-strapped first-time buyers will simply be priced out, while a cohort of potential move-up buyers will decide to stay in their existing home, make renovations and enjoy their current low mortgage rate. Price increases will moderate, and everyone in the market will need to adjust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, more homes to choose from</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the biggest complaints among buyers in the last several years is that there weren't enough homes for sale. In fact, the supply of houses hit historic lows in the winter of 2017 and has yet to rebound substantially. That fueled bidding wars, price increases and frustration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply crunch is expected to ease some in 2019 with inventory rising 10 percent to 15 percent, according to Yun. But the increase will be skewed toward the mid-to-high end of the market – houses priced $250,000 and higher – especially when it comes to newly built houses, said Danielle Hale, chief economist of realtor. com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That’s good news for move-up buyers, but not so much for the first-time millennial buyer. “There’s still a mismatch on the entry-level side,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Houses in all shapes and sizes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're a first-time buyer, you won’t be completely out of luck if you stay open-minded. If a single-family home is out of the question, consider a mobile home or townhouse as a starter home, both of which are on the rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The volume of shipments for manufactured houses – also known as mobile homes – is expected to finish above 100,000 this year, up from 93,000 in 2017, according to Robert Dietz, chief economist of the National Association of Home Builders. The trend is expected to continue next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These homes are also significantly cheaper than other home types. Not including land costs, the cost to buy a mobile home averages $70,600, compared with $257,900 for an existing single-family home and $309,700 for a new home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You may also consider a townhouse, an attached single-family home located in a community of homes. Construction of townhomes also is experiencing year-over-year growth and is outpacing the single-family detached home market, Dietz said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The market is being supported by millennials moving from renting to their first-home purchase,” he said. “If you’re in a high-cost area with wage and job growth, townhouses are appropriate for entry-level. And they still get that suburban feel with their own front door. ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Affording a home remains hard</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing values are still expected to increase next year, but not at the gang-buster pace seen in recent years. NAR’s Yun forecasts modest price growth between 2 percent and 3 percent, down from close to 5 percent this year and over 5 percent in 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, mortgage rates are expected to hit 5. 5 percent by the end of 2019. Both factors make it more expensive for buyers to purchase a home. Hale estimates that the expected increase in prices and interest rates translates to an 8 percent rise in the average monthly mortgage payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest rate trap</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shrinking affordability will convince some buyers – especially first-timers – to sit out the market altogether next year because they can’t make the numbers work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners considering selling their home may also stay put because of rising mortgage rates – a so-called interest rate trap. Most outstanding mortgages have an interest rate of 4. 5 percent or less, according to a report this year from Black Knight, a data analytics firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They have a nice low mortgage rate, lower than the current rate, so there’s no reason to move,” said Mark Fleming, chief economist of First American Financial Corp. , a provider of title insurance. “It’s essentially more expensive to buy their own home back. ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tax worries linger</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first few months of 2019 will reveal exactly how the new tax changes affect homeowners. One key rule is the new cap on the mortgage interest deduction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before, homeowners could deduct interest they paid on up to $1 million in mortgage debt – including interest on home equity loans and lines of credit – reducing their taxable income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, you can only deduct interest on up to $750,000 in mortgage debt. Interest paid on home equity loans and lines of credit is deductible only if the funds were used to pay for home improvements or renovations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only taxpayers who will exceed those limits are high-end homeowners and buyers and those with multiple homes with mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bigger question mark is if and how the $10,000 limit on state and local taxes deduction – known as SALT – will affect housing markets in high-tax states such as New Jersey, New York, Connecticut and California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers may be reluctant to purchase homes in those states – or choose a smaller house – if they calculate they will pay too much in non-deductible taxes. “These states may see softer housing markets compared to the rest of the country,” said Yun, if the SALT cap hurts enough homeowners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's the bottom line</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're a seller: Price realistically and be ready to cut the listing price or offer other incentives to get a deal done. “It’s still a seller’s market, but not like it was,” Hale said. “Sellers need to be mindful of competition, especially for more expensive properties. ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're a buyer: Don't worry about going slow when making decisions. “There is less buyer competition and more inventory,” Yun said. “Buyers can take time to find the home that fits into their budget. ”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Clarifications: An earlier version of this story misspelled the first name of Jon Reidy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A couple of years ago, freshly-minted college graduates Jon and Samantha Reidy crisscrossed North Carolina in search of a place to settle and buy a house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After hitting seven cities – including bustling millennial enclaves such as Charlotte, Durham and Raleigh – they decided that nearly all of those housing markets had gotten too expensive. So they picked under-the-radar Winston-Salem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, they bought a house there for $106,000, including repairs, and plan to stay in the area for decades. Jon is even hoping to convince his parents to move down from Agawam, Mass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We have no intention of leaving,” says the 24-year-old athletic trainer. Besides its mix of urban amenities and laid-back pace, “Winston was a place we could afford. ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 50 percent runup in U. S. home prices since 2011 is reshuffling the pecking order of hot housing markets. While many midsize metro areas that had been affordable, up-and-coming alternatives – such as Kansas City, Missouri; Nashville, Tennessee; Raleigh; and Salt Lake City – are still coveted by buyers, their sales are declining or increasing more slowly amid sharply rising prices and shrinking supplies.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More: Amazon is no longer a Seattle company. Here's what that will mean for future workers and its second headquarters</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, many smaller, more affordable markets – such as Boise, Idaho; Dayton, Ohio; Greenville, South Carolina; and Winston-Salem – are benefiting from an influx of new residents and home sales that continue to climb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Even the second-tier markets are getting a little too pricey for a lot of residents,” economist Adam Kamins of Moody’s Analytics says. “Home prices are not rising as rapidly in the (third-tier) markets … and if you can get a good job there you may find a better quality of life. ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In second-tier metro areas – ranked 26th to 50th by population – single-family house prices increased 10 percent in the 12 months ending in the first quarter to a median of $343,000, according to <span class="companylink">Moody’s</span> figures. Sales were virtually flat last year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More: Home prices are high. What could cool them down?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Nashville, the median home price was up 8. 6 percent annually at $263,000. That came on the heels of four consecutive years of double-digit price increases, <span class="companylink">Moody’s</span> figures show. In the city and just beyond, the median home price tops $300,000. Nashville is a hotbed for tech, health care and aerospace companies, and its vibrant downtown is a millennial magnet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the soaring prices have taken a toll. Homeowners devote 35. 1 percent of their monthly income to housing costs, up from a 27. 8 percent average over the past 13 years, according to ATTOM Data Solutions. Metro area sales fell 4. 3 percent in 2017 year and are down 0. 5 percent so far this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Things have slowed down,” says Sher Powers, an area broker and president of Greater Nashville Realtors. “It’s not a bad thing for the market. It can’t sustain itself endlessly. There has to be some correcting. It’s still a sellers’ market. "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daniel Williams, 32, and his wife searched for an entry-level house for three months and lost out on three bids before finally purchasing a three-bedroom in the Antioch community. But they had to shell out $220,000 for it, well above the $180,000 they had budgeted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It makes me nervous,” says Williams, an auto mechanic. “I’ve never owned a home before. ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Domestic net migration – the net number of people moving into the Nashville area after accounting for those moving out – slowed to 18,700 in 2017 after topping 20,000 for two years, according to Moody’s and Census Bureau data</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Kansas City, another midsize city, home prices jumped 10. 3 percent last year while sales fell about 10 percent, according to <span class="companylink">Moody’s</span>. Some buyers have been priced out, but there also just aren’t enough homes available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We put a house on the market and the same day it’s going to be sold,” says Andrea Sheridan, a broker and president of the Kansas City Regional Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, many smaller cities have a healthier balance of supply and demand, as well as lower prices. In third-tier markets, ranked 51 to 100 by population, prices rose 6. 4 percent to $246,000 in the first quarter from a year earlier – below the U. S. median of $264,000 – and sales were up about 1 percent, in line with the national average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Winston-Salem, home prices were up about 9 percent annually, but that followed just a 3 percent uptick over the previous two years. And the median price early this year was still a manageable $166,000. The share of monthly income needed to pay housing costs is 22. 8 percent, down from a 13-year-average of 24. 6 percent, ATTOMS figures show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Slow and steady has been the Winston way,” says Blake Ginther, owner of the Ginther Group realtors. Home sales leaped 23 percent in 2016 and another 22 percent last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides its affordable housing and temperate climate, the area – home to Hanesbrands clothing, tobacco giant <span class="companylink">R. J. Reynolds</span> and <span class="companylink">BB&amp;T</span> bank – has used its revived downtown and growing health care industry to draw retirees and some millennials, Ginther says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You can be away from the city, but you can still get there in 10 minutes,” says Reidy, the trainer whose three-bedroom house occupies a half-acre lot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Domestic net migration to the area rose to 4,300 last year from 3,000 in 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, however, some third-tier metro areas are getting pricier as they draw more residents. In Boise, a tech hub that has fast become a hip, more affordable alternative to larger cities such as Seattle and Portland, Oregon, the median house price was up 18. 4 percent early this year at $255,000. In Aida County, which includes, Boise, the median was $324,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet home sales were up 23 percent in 2017 and 2 percent the first half of this year despite historically low supplies, according to Moodys and Boise Regional Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We continue to be an attractive place,” says Gary Salisbury, a local broker and president of the realtors group.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Todd and Marisa Bluth bought a $188,000 starter house in Commerce City, Colorado, in 2012, they figured it would take at least a decade to build enough equity and savings to trade up to their dream home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet just four years later, they sold the 1,600-square foot unit for $284,000, allowing them to take their nearly $100,000 profit and buy a five-bedroom nearly three times the size for what seemed like a steal – $375,000 – in a more upscale neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I never thought the house would appreciate so quickly," Todd, 34, says. "We played the market against itself."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the U.S. housing recovery began in 2012, affordable homes in modest neighborhoods have notched the sharpest price increases while luxury houses in wealthy neighborhoods have had the smallest percentage gains. In other words, on average, the lower the home-price tier, the more dramatic the price increase, with mid-range homes appreciating moderately.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More room to recover</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend is largely rooted in the fact that prices of inexpensive houses fell the steepest during the real estate crash and so had more room to recover, says economist Kwame Donaldson of Moody's Analytics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, affordable, entry-level homes have been in short supply, driving up their price tags, says Issi Romem, chief economist of Trulia, a real estate research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unusual dynamic is allowing homeowners like the Bluths to move up to their "forever homes" more rapidly. It's also helping many low- and moderate-income Americans amass wealth that can improve their lifestyles or bolster their nest eggs. But first-time buyers looking to get into the market now may be squeezed out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bluths, who had a daughter when they lived in their first house, needed to move because another child was on the way, and they've since had a third. "It would have been getting pretty crowded," Todd, an attorney, says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a combined income of about $70,000, the couple took out a government-backed mortgage for their starter house, allowing them to make a down payment of just 3.5%. The home's sharp price appreciation let them put down 20% for their current, larger home, eliminating the need to pay mortgage insurance and helping them pay off the $10,000 they owed on a car loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, they've paid the same amount each month for their new home as they did for their first house and the car. "We've been very fortunate," Todd says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 204 of the nation's most populous counties, the bottom 10% of neighborhoods with the lowest median household income posted the largest average annual home price increases from 2011 to 2018 – 7.6%, according to a <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> analysis. The top 10% of neighborhoods with the highest median income notched the lowest annual price gains at 5.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Trulia</span> found similar results in a study based on home prices rather than a neighborhood's median income. From 2012 to February 2019, the bottom third of homes with the lowest prices appreciated an average 8.03% a year, compared with 6.39% for mid-level homes and 5.01% for the most expensive units, the analysis found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Affordable homes hurt</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">in downturn</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A big reason for the disparity is that home prices in the lowest-income neighborhoods tumbled the most during the housing crash – an average 7.4% a year – while values in the wealthiest areas fell the least – 4.3%, according to <span class="companylink">Moody's</span>. That's likely because low-wage workers lost their jobs in greater numbers during the 2007-09 recession, and many couldn't make their monthly mortgage payments, Donaldson says. Many also had subprime mortgages they couldn't repay as home prices began spiraling downward. As a result, houses in those neighborhoods experienced more foreclosures and were resold by lenders at bargain prices, lowering average values in those zip codes and setting the stage for a bigger rebound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another factor is that while the number of homes on the market remains historically low, affordable, entry-level units are especially in short supply and so their prices have climbed more rapidly, <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>'s Romem says. Builders are putting up few starter houses because they can't make a profit amid high labor, material and land costs, he says. In February, there were more than twice as many top-tier homes available as bottom-tier units, <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> figures show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Chattanooga, Tennessee area, which has the strongest correlation between lower median incomes and sharp price increases among the 204 counties studied, "There's no new construction under $200,000," says Mark Hite, a broker at a Keller Williams franchise in town.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many low- to moderate-income shoppers are buying affordable homes, leveraging the rising prices to obtain home equity loans for renovations and then selling and moving to larger houses, Hite says. Others are using the increased equity in their homes as collateral to start small businesses, says Geoff Ramsey, a broker at REMAX Properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Northern homeowners</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">score profits</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In northern New Jersey, some lower-wage homeowners are banking much of their profits and buying cheaper houses in the southern part of the state or in low-cost places such as Florida and South Carolina, says Andee Post, a broker with Keller Williams in Woodcliff Lake, New Jersey. "If you're going to move south, you can get a lot of house for your money," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all lower-income house dwellers have benefited from the price run-up. Many foreclosed homes were snapped up by investors and rented out. In the nation's poorest neighborhoods, two-thirds of homes are investor-owned, Donaldson says. Still, that means a third are occupied by low- to moderate-income owners who are reaping gains. And a larger share of houses is owned by residents in still-modest neighborhoods with slightly higher median incomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The windfall for owners of less expensive homes may be petering out now that home prices in all categories are well past their pre-recession peak. Gains for affordable houses are still leading, but the gap has narrowed substantially since early 2017, according to <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>. That's largely because the price increases have made starter homes less affordable for lower-income Americans in particular, tempering demand, Romem says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the median asking price for a U. S. home hit a record $300,000 in March, not all housing markets are seeing the same boost, according to data from Realtor. com</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asking prices are falling in many metro areas where housing values were once running away. For example, the median list price in San Jose, California, was $1,100,050 in March. That’s the highest asking price of 500 U. S. metro areas, but it’s 11. 6% lower than last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median list prices in Denver and Boulder, Colorado – once-hot markets – also showed similar drops. The worst decline was in Lynchburg, Virginia, where the median ask price plummeted 37% year-over-year to $145,000.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">As pricey homes hit market, median list price for a house reaches record $300,000</span>
</div><div class="author">Janna Herron </div><div>546 words</div><div>4 April 2019</div><div>USA Today Online</div><div>USATONL</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2019 USA Today Online. Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All rights reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're selling a high-end home, you've got company. More pricey houses are up for sale this year, pushing listing prices to record highs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median asking price for a U. S. home hit $300,000 for the first time ever in March, according to housing data from Realtor. com to be released later Thursday and provided early to USA TODAY. That topped the previous peak of $299,000 reached in June and July of last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, there are signs that things are slowing for sellers. Year over year, the median list price increased 7% in March, slightly lower than the growth rate of 8% from the same month in 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In spite of the fact that some markets are slowing, we are hitting that level in March, which tends to not be the highest price during the year,” says Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor. com. “This suggests that we’ll see prices go above $300,000 this year. ”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why are sellers asking for more?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reason for the jump in list price isn’t necessarily because sellers are overly optimistic. Instead, higher-priced homes tend to come onto the market in the spring, pushing up the overall median, and this year, more of these pricier homes are hitting the sales block.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of houses priced above $750,000 jumped 11% from last year, while the supply of entry-level homes sunk by 9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’re seeing this shift toward more home available in the higher price points,” Hale says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, there were 56,000 more homes for sale in March versus last year, up 4%. The inventory growth largely occurred in the 50 largest U. S. markets mostly on the pricey West Coast West, including San Jose (up 114%), Seattle (up 77%) and San Francisco (up 44%).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hottest areas cool</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In some markets, we see list prices declining,” Hale says, “but in others, list prices are increasing faster than the national pace. ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Listing prices are declining in what were some of the hottest housing markets in the country, Hale says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, the median asking price in San Jose, California, was $1,100,050 in March – the highest of 500 metro areas, but down 11. 6% from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median asking prices in Denver and Boulder, Colorado, experienced similar declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median asking price declined the most year over year in Lynchburg, Virginia, plunging 37% to $145,000. Overall, 114 of the 500 markets Realtor. com surveyed saw a drop in the median listing price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other side, smaller markets in the middle of the county experienced the largest increases in asking prices such as Kokomo, Indiana (up 42. 9% to $122,540); and Columbus, Indiana (up 31. 6% to $309,950).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s an interesting year to be a seller. It really matters where you are this year and what price point,” Hale says. “It’s very important to do your research. That will make the difference. ”</p>

</div><div class="author">Josh Boak </div><div>392 words</div><div>22 March 2019</div><div>USA Today Online</div><div>USATONL</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2019 USA Today Online. Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All rights reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON — U. S. home sales soared 11. 8 percent in February, aided by accelerating wages and falling mortgage rates that are improving affordability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said Friday that existing homes sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5. 51 million last month, a decisively sharp rebound from a pace of 4. 94 million in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The burst in sales points to the housing market regaining the momentum that it lost in the middle of 2018, after a spike in rates for home loans caused sales to slow. The February sales figures point toward growth in sales of homes priced between $250,000 and $500,000, a range that is generally affordable to middle-class families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This was fueled principally by an improvement in affordability resulting from a combination of slower house price gains, lower mortgage rates and more rapid wage growth,” said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide Mutual Insurance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, existing-home sales are down 1. 8 percent from a year ago because of the severity of last year’s slowdown. But 30-year mortgage rates have since tumbled after peaking in early November at roughly 5 percent, helping sales to recover as that average has fallen to 4. 28 percent this week, according to mortgage buyer <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates will likely fall further. The Federal Reserve indicated this week that it foresees no further interest rate increases this year — a message that has sent the yield on the 10-year Treasury note plunging. Rates on long-term mortgages closely track the 10-year yield.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price in January was $247,500, a slight increase of 3. 6 percent from last year. Home price growth has been converging with average hourly wage gains in recent months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, February’s sales bust caused the months’ supply of homes on the market to tumble to 3. 5 months from 4. 4 months in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales climbed in the Midwest, South and West in February but were unchanged in the Northeast.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Clarifications: An earlier version of this story misspelled the first name of Jon Reidy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A couple of years ago, freshly-minted college graduates Jon and Samantha Reidy crisscrossed North Carolina in search of a place to settle and buy a house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After hitting seven cities – including bustling millennial enclaves such as Charlotte, Durham and Raleigh – they decided that nearly all of those housing markets had gotten too expensive. So they picked under-the-radar Winston-Salem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, they bought a house there for $106,000, including repairs, and plan to stay in the area for decades. Jon is even hoping to convince his parents to move down from Agawam, Mass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We have no intention of leaving,” says the 24-year-old athletic trainer. Besides its mix of urban amenities and laid-back pace, “Winston was a place we could afford. ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 50 percent runup in U. S. home prices since 2011 is reshuffling the pecking order of hot housing markets. While many midsize metro areas that had been affordable, up-and-coming alternatives – such as Kansas City, Missouri; Nashville, Tennessee; Raleigh; and Salt Lake City – are still coveted by buyers, their sales are declining or increasing more slowly amid sharply rising prices and shrinking supplies.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More: Amazon is no longer a Seattle company. Here's what that will mean for future workers and its second headquarters</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, many smaller, more affordable markets – such as Boise, Idaho; Dayton, Ohio; Greenville, South Carolina; and Winston-Salem – are benefiting from an influx of new residents and home sales that continue to climb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Even the second-tier markets are getting a little too pricey for a lot of residents,” economist Adam Kamins of Moody’s Analytics says. “Home prices are not rising as rapidly in the (third-tier) markets … and if you can get a good job there you may find a better quality of life. ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In second-tier metro areas – ranked 26th to 50th by population – single-family house prices increased 10 percent in the 12 months ending in the first quarter to a median of $343,000, according to <span class="companylink">Moody’s</span> figures. Sales were virtually flat last year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More: Home prices are high. What could cool them down?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Nashville, the median home price was up 8. 6 percent annually at $263,000. That came on the heels of four consecutive years of double-digit price increases, <span class="companylink">Moody’s</span> figures show. In the city and just beyond, the median home price tops $300,000. Nashville is a hotbed for tech, health care and aerospace companies, and its vibrant downtown is a millennial magnet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the soaring prices have taken a toll. Homeowners devote 35. 1 percent of their monthly income to housing costs, up from a 27. 8 percent average over the past 13 years, according to ATTOM Data Solutions. Metro area sales fell 4. 3 percent in 2017 year and are down 0. 5 percent so far this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Things have slowed down,” says Sher Powers, an area broker and president of Greater Nashville Realtors. “It’s not a bad thing for the market. It can’t sustain itself endlessly. There has to be some correcting. It’s still a sellers’ market. "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daniel Williams, 32, and his wife searched for an entry-level house for three months and lost out on three bids before finally purchasing a three-bedroom in the Antioch community. But they had to shell out $220,000 for it, well above the $180,000 they had budgeted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It makes me nervous,” says Williams, an auto mechanic. “I’ve never owned a home before. ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Domestic net migration – the net number of people moving into the Nashville area after accounting for those moving out – slowed to 18,700 in 2017 after topping 20,000 for two years, according to Moody’s and Census Bureau data</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Kansas City, another midsize city, home prices jumped 10. 3 percent last year while sales fell about 10 percent, according to <span class="companylink">Moody’s</span> . Some buyers have been priced out, but there also just aren’t enough homes available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We put a house on the market and the same day it’s going to be sold,” says Andrea Sheridan, a broker and president of the Kansas City Regional Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, many smaller cities have a healthier balance of supply and demand, as well as lower prices. In third-tier markets, ranked 51 to 100 by population, prices rose 6. 4 percent to $246,000 in the first quarter from a year earlier – below the U. S. median of $264,000 – and sales were up about 1 percent, in line with the national average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Winston-Salem, home prices were up about 9 percent annually, but that followed just a 3 percent uptick over the previous two years. And the median price early this year was still a manageable $166,000. The share of monthly income needed to pay housing costs is 22. 8 percent, down from a 13-year-average of 24. 6 percent, ATTOMS figures show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Slow and steady has been the Winston way,” says Blake Ginther, owner of the Ginther Group realtors. Home sales leaped 23 percent in 2016 and another 22 percent last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides its affordable housing and temperate climate, the area – home to Hanesbrands clothing, tobacco giant <span class="companylink">R. J. Reynolds</span> and <span class="companylink">BB&amp;T</span> bank – has used its revived downtown and growing health care industry to draw retirees and some millennials, Ginther says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You can be away from the city, but you can still get there in 10 minutes,” says Reidy, the trainer whose three-bedroom house occupies a half-acre lot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Domestic net migration to the area rose to 4,300 last year from 3,000 in 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, however, some third-tier metro areas are getting pricier as they draw more residents. In Boise, a tech hub that has fast become a hip, more affordable alternative to larger cities such as Seattle and Portland, Oregon, the median house price was up 18. 4 percent early this year at $255,000. In Aida County, which includes, Boise, the median was $324,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet home sales were up 23 percent in 2017 and 2 percent the first half of this year despite historically low supplies, according to Moodys and Boise Regional Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We continue to be an attractive place,” says Gary Salisbury, a local broker and president of the realtors group.</p>

</div><div class="author">Janna Herron </div><div>1114 words</div><div>21 March 2019</div><div>USA Today Online</div><div>USATONL</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2019 USA Today Online. Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All rights reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forget fevered bidding wars and snap home-buying decisions. Slower and steadier will characterize next year's housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That follows a 2018 that started off hot but softened into the fall as buyers – put off by high prices and few choices – sat out rather than paid up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Affordability issues will remain a top concern going into 2019, exacerbated by rising mortgage rates. But some of 2018's more intractable issues will begin to loosen up. The volume of for-sale homes is expected to rise and diversify, while the number of buyers is forecast to shrink.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For home sellers, they need to recognize those days of frenzied market are over. They must price competitively to sell their home," said Lawrence Yun, the chief economist at the National Association of Realtors. "For buyers, there will be challenges when it comes to rising interest rates, but they don't have to make hurried decisions anymore. "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some cash-strapped first-time buyers will simply be priced out, while a cohort of potential move-up buyers will decide to stay in their existing home, make renovations and enjoy their current low mortgage rate. Price increases will moderate, and everyone in the market will need to adjust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, more homes to choose from</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the biggest complaints among buyers in the last several years is that there weren't enough homes for sale. In fact, the supply of houses hit historic lows in the winter of 2017 and has yet to rebound substantially. That fueled bidding wars, price increases and frustration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply crunch is expected to ease some in 2019 with inventory rising 10 percent to 15 percent, according to Yun. But the increase will be skewed toward the mid-to-high end of the market – houses priced $250,000 and higher – especially when it comes to newly built houses, said Danielle Hale, chief economist of realtor. com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That’s good news for move-up buyers, but not so much for the first-time millennial buyer. “There’s still a mismatch on the entry-level side,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Houses in all shapes and sizes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're a first-time buyer, you won’t be completely out of luck if you stay open-minded. If a single-family home is out of the question, consider a mobile home or townhouse as a starter home, both of which are on the rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The volume of shipments for manufactured houses – also known as mobile homes – is expected to finish above 100,000 this year, up from 93,000 in 2017, according to Robert Dietz, chief economist of the National Association of Home Builders. The trend is expected to continue next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These homes are also significantly cheaper than other home types. Not including land costs, the cost to buy a mobile home averages $70,600, compared with $257,900 for an existing single-family home and $309,700 for a new home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You may also consider a townhouse, an attached single-family home located in a community of homes. Construction of townhomes also is experiencing year-over-year growth and is outpacing the single-family detached home market, Dietz said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The market is being supported by millennials moving from renting to their first-home purchase,” he said. “If you’re in a high-cost area with wage and job growth, townhouses are appropriate for entry-level. And they still get that suburban feel with their own front door. ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Affording a home remains hard</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing values are still expected to increase next year, but not at the gang-buster pace seen in recent years. NAR’s Yun forecasts modest price growth between 2 percent and 3 percent, down from close to 5 percent this year and over 5 percent in 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, mortgage rates are expected to hit 5. 5 percent by the end of 2019. Both factors make it more expensive for buyers to purchase a home. Hale estimates that the expected increase in prices and interest rates translates to an 8 percent rise in the average monthly mortgage payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest rate trap</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shrinking affordability will convince some buyers – especially first-timers – to sit out the market altogether next year because they can’t make the numbers work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners considering selling their home may also stay put because of rising mortgage rates – a so-called interest rate trap. Most outstanding mortgages have an interest rate of 4. 5 percent or less, according to a report this year from Black Knight, a data analytics firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They have a nice low mortgage rate, lower than the current rate, so there’s no reason to move,” said Mark Fleming, chief economist of First American Financial Corp. , a provider of title insurance. “It’s essentially more expensive to buy their own home back. ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tax worries linger</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first few months of 2019 will reveal exactly how the new tax changes affect homeowners. One key rule is the new cap on the mortgage interest deduction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before, homeowners could deduct interest they paid on up to $1 million in mortgage debt – including interest on home equity loans and lines of credit – reducing their taxable income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, you can only deduct interest on up to $750,000 in mortgage debt. Interest paid on home equity loans and lines of credit is deductible only if the funds were used to pay for home improvements or renovations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only taxpayers who will exceed those limits are high-end homeowners and buyers and those with multiple homes with mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bigger question mark is if and how the $10,000 limit on state and local taxes deduction – known as SALT – will affect housing markets in high-tax states such as New Jersey, New York, Connecticut and California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers may be reluctant to purchase homes in those states – or choose a smaller house – if they calculate they will pay too much in non-deductible taxes. “These states may see softer housing markets compared to the rest of the country,” said Yun, if the SALT cap hurts enough homeowners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's the bottom line</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're a seller: Price realistically and be ready to cut the listing price or offer other incentives to get a deal done. “It’s still a seller’s market, but not like it was,” Hale said. “Sellers need to be mindful of competition, especially for more expensive properties. ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're a buyer: Don't worry about going slow when making decisions. “There is less buyer competition and more inventory,” Yun said. “Buyers can take time to find the home that fits into their budget. ”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June, Natalee King and her husband, Jonathan, realized a decade-long dream of buying a home in Orange County, California, one of the more expensive housing markets in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple drained their savings for a down payment to win the fixer-upper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But concerned about the cost of future repairs and compelled to rebuild their savings, they decided to rent out the master bedroom with its own bathroom for $1,250. From September through January, two college students on internships leased the space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That rent money gave the Kings a bit of relief, and they're looking for more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They just signed another renter who is expected to move in at the end of the month. They plan to rent for at least a year to steady their finances as Jonathan goes back to school for a career change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Unless you were gifted money, the only way to own a home if you’re middle income is you have to rent," Natalee, 35, said. "We see it all the time. Some people may think it’s weird, but I feel like, in Orange County, it’s the norm now to have that American Dream. ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More money: Where's my paycheck? <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> customers say direct deposits not showing up after outage</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is this normal?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kings are part of a small, but now seemingly permanent, trend of married couples taking in roommates to defray high housing costs, according to a new study from <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> given exclusively to USA TODAY.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More married couples turned to this arrangement as home prices peaked right before the housing crash. They largely stuck with it through the Great Recession and even as the economy bounced back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scam alert: Latest Social Security scam call makes you out to be the criminal. How to avoid falling for it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The thing is home prices keep going up and up, while wages remained flat. So, it makes sense that people are having a tough time with housing costs, even as the economy has gotten better,” said Cheryl Young, a senior economist at <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The percentage of renting and home-owning married couples with roommates is now 28 percent higher than its historical average between 1995 and 2018, <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> found. The increase is led by more married homeowners taking on roommates, which is 38 percent higher than its historical average, <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The share of married renters with roommates is up just 11 percent over the historical average, but these couples are almost three times more likely to have a roommate.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Trulia</span> found that West Coast markets have a higher share of this unique housing arrangement, likely because they have had some of the fastest home price growth over the last decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There is clear correlation between high home prices and rates of married couples with roommates,” Young said. For every $100,000 increase in median metro home prices, there is a 0. 25 percentage point increase in the rate of married couples living with roommates, <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Owning in Oakland</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Oakland, California, Katy Liang, her husband and their two children have been living with a family friend for the past three-and-a-half years since they bought their three-bedroom house for $1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We decided to get a roommate because the mortgage is a lot, and we're a house of two teachers,” Katy, 34, said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their roommate – a friend of her husband – pays $900 each month to rent out the master bedroom with its own bathroom. The rent makes up one-fifth of the total $4,400 monthly mortgage payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The arrangement has been smooth, Liang said. The roommate doesn’t use the kitchen much and instead relies on a hot plate, microwave and mini fridge in his room. But he joins the family sometimes for holiday celebrations and will play with the kids outside.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Liang originally thought he’d move out after they had their second child, who’s 7 months old now. “But we feel like we have enough space still for our family,” she said. “Maybe when the kids need their own room, another three years maybe. ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sharing in Seattle</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Michelle Hardies switched careers, she and her husband, Don, wanted extra income while she built up her new business as a real estate agent. Don, who had lived with the same boarder for 12 years with his ex-wife, suggested a roommate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their home – a four-bedroom house in Lake Stevens, Washington – was big enough and ideally located about a 20-minute drive from Everett, where <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> has a major facility, and 30 minutes from northern Seattle, where rents are becoming unaffordable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s not possible for people to rent on one income in Seattle,” Don, 58, said. “People are being forced to move further and further out of the city to afford to rent or buy. ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past 10 months, they’ve had success renting two rooms on a month-to-month basis, largely to shorter-term boarders. There have been some issues. Two roommates were asked to move out, and another unexpectedly passed away while on vacation. Otherwise, the Hardies – who married two years ago – have been pleased with the arrangement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You have to give up some privacy,” Michelle, 50, said. “As a couple you might not do some of the things you would normally do as a couple – as newlyweds. ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Wink, wink, nod, nod,” Don added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In this case, we don’t want anything too long-term,” Don continued. “We want to go back to no roommates, that’s preferred for us. But for now, it makes economic sense. ”</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">What housing slump? Amazon HQ2 juices spring home buying season in northern Virginia</span>
</div><div class="author">Paul Davidson </div><div>923 words</div><div>21 March 2019</div><div>USA Today Online</div><div>USATONL</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2019 USA Today Online. Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All rights reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amazon delivered a different kind of Christmas present to homeowners in Arlington, Virginia: an early spring home-buying season that’s setting housing prices ablaze.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company’s November announcement that it picked the Crystal City area of Arlington for its second headquarters, or HQ2, has driven area home prices substantially higher in just a few months, according to Redfin and Realtor. com. The market is likely to heat up further as the spring sales season draws near.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Amazon’s recent bombshell that it’s scuttling plans to locate half of HQ2 in Queens, New York, because of local political opposition has only intensified buyer interest in Arlington, says Redfin broker Brian McMahon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hot market is a boon for home sellers but is hurting buyers, especially those seeking low-priced starter homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price surge is defying a national housing market that cooled in the second half of 2018 amid rising mortgage rates and tight inventory. Home sales across the country are expected to be down slightly this spring shopping season from a year ago. But the market should pick up steam later in 2019 as a result of moderating rates, more plentiful supplies and rising wages, says Lawrence Yun, chief economist of the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sandwich by your finances?Middle-aged Americans fall short on savings</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher mortgage rates and limited inventory made for listless home sales in Arlington in the months leading up to the Amazon news, McMahon says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It started to slide into a funk in late summer, early fall,” he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amazon’s announcement that it’s bringing 25,000 to 38,000 jobs to the Crystal City area over the next dozen years – with an initial 400 coming later this year – was an adrenaline shot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jessica and Joel Sackett had ditched plans to put their two-bedroom condo on the market last summer after McMahon told them it wouldn’t fetch more than $575,000, marginally above what they paid for it 2 ½ years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after the Amazon news, “We said let’s try it,” Joel, 35, says. “We’re only two metro stops away from Crystal City. “</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within 24 hours of listing their Old Town, Alexandria, condo at $600,000 in early December, they had an offer for $606,000. “I was ecstatic,” Joel says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although that deal fell through in early January, the couple immediately relisted the unit and got a $600,000 offer, again within 24 hours. The closing was Monday, with the Sacketts moving to a larger townhouse in Alexandria.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sellers across Arlington are reaping even bigger gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From October to January, the median home sale price in the county rose 11 percent from $545,000 to $605,000, according to Redfin’s analysis of Multiple Listing Service data. Both Redfin and Realtor. com officials largely attribute the price jump to Amazon. Homes in the larger Washington D. C. metro area dipped 3. 8 percent during that period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the number of homes sold in Arlington was up 24. 8 percent in December from a year earlier and 18. 2 percent in January. That reverses the historical trend: Typically, sales and prices tumble through the winter months. In the October-December period a year ago, county home prices fell 13. 7 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crystal City and surrounding areas are also benefiting. From October to December, median home sale prices in those communities increased 8. 1 percent, compared to a 0. 8 percent dip a year earlier, according to Realtor. com. Some buyers looking to move to the area are trying to snag a home before prices skyrocket, says Realtor. com Chief Economist Danielle Hale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many investors, meanwhile, aim to turn a quick profit or rent out units at high rates, McMahon says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers “are calling and saying, ‘We saw what happened in the Seattle area and we think the same thing will take place in the Crystal City area,’” says Virginia Smith, president of Arlington Realty in Crystal City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seattle area home prices have climbed 60. 7 percent the past five years, partly because of growth at Amazon’s current headquarters and other tech companies, says Zillow senior economist Aaron Terrazas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Crystal City, office rents are also feeling the Amazon effect. Asking rates rose 69 cents in the fourth quarter to $37. 33 per square foot annually, largely because of Amazon, according to CBRE.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amazon would not comment on the rising real estate prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many homeowners, meanwhile, are biding their time and hoping for a bigger payday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They’re holding off from listing and waiting to see what’s going to happen” when Amazon employees begin moving into the area later this year, McMahon says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That, he says, helps explain why Arlington’s housing inventory was down 30 percent to 40 percent from a year earlier from November through January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If a flood of eager house hunters collides with wary homeowners, it could make for a less active spring selling season that drives prices even higher, McMahon says. Yet Hale and McMahon are betting more homeowners will list their houses this spring as demand and prices rise, providing some relief to buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As costs increase, though, shoppers seeking entry-level homes “will likely find themselves suddenly priced out of the area,” Hale says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June, Natalee King and her husband, Jonathan, realized a decade-long dream of buying a home in Orange County, California, one of the more expensive housing markets in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple drained their savings for a down payment to win the fixer-upper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But concerned about the cost of future repairs and compelled to rebuild their savings, they decided to rent out the master bedroom with its own bathroom for $1,250. From September through January, two college students on internships leased the space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That rent money gave the Kings a bit of relief, and they're looking for more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They just signed another renter who is expected to move in at the end of the month. They plan to rent for at least a year to steady their finances as Jonathan goes back to school for a career change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Unless you were gifted money, the only way to own a home if you’re middle income is you have to rent," Natalee, 35, said. "We see it all the time. Some people may think it’s weird, but I feel like, in Orange County, it’s the norm now to have that American Dream. ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More money: Where's my paycheck? <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> customers say direct deposits not showing up after outage</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is this normal?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kings are part of a small, but now seemingly permanent, trend of married couples taking in roommates to defray high housing costs, according to a new study from <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> given exclusively to USA TODAY.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More married couples turned to this arrangement as home prices peaked right before the housing crash. They largely stuck with it through the Great Recession and even as the economy bounced back.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The thing is home prices keep going up and up, while wages remained flat. So, it makes sense that people are having a tough time with housing costs, even as the economy has gotten better,” said Cheryl Young, a senior economist at <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The percentage of renting and home-owning married couples with roommates is now 28 percent higher than its historical average between 1995 and 2018, <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> found. The increase is led by more married homeowners taking on roommates, which is 38 percent higher than its historical average, <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The share of married renters with roommates is up just 11 percent over the historical average, but these couples are almost three times more likely to have a roommate.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Trulia</span> found that West Coast markets have a higher share of this unique housing arrangement, likely because they have had some of the fastest home price growth over the last decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There is clear correlation between high home prices and rates of married couples with roommates,” Young said. For every $100,000 increase in median metro home prices, there is a 0. 25 percentage point increase in the rate of married couples living with roommates, <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Owning in Oakland</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Oakland, California, Katy Liang, her husband and their two children have been living with a family friend for the past three-and-a-half years since they bought their three-bedroom house for $1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We decided to get a roommate because the mortgage is a lot, and we're a house of two teachers,” Katy, 34, said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their roommate – a friend of her husband – pays $900 each month to rent out the master bedroom with its own bathroom. The rent makes up one-fifth of the total $4,400 monthly mortgage payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The arrangement has been smooth, Liang said. The roommate doesn’t use the kitchen much and instead relies on a hot plate, microwave and mini fridge in his room. But he joins the family sometimes for holiday celebrations and will play with the kids outside.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Liang originally thought he’d move out after they had their second child, who’s 7 months old now. “But we feel like we have enough space still for our family,” she said. “Maybe when the kids need their own room, another three years maybe. ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sharing in Seattle</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Michelle Hardies switched careers, she and her husband, Don, wanted extra income while she built up her new business as a real estate agent. Don, who had lived with the same boarder for 12 years with his ex-wife, suggested a roommate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their home – a four-bedroom house in Lake Stevens, Washington – was big enough and ideally located about a 20-minute drive from Everett, where <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> has a major facility, and 30 minutes from northern Seattle, where rents are becoming unaffordable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s not possible for people to rent on one income in Seattle,” Don, 58, said. “People are being forced to move further and further out of the city to afford to rent or buy. ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past 10 months, they’ve had success renting two rooms on a month-to-month basis, largely to shorter-term boarders. There have been some issues. Two roommates were asked to move out, and another unexpectedly passed away while on vacation. Otherwise, the Hardies – who married two years ago – have been pleased with the arrangement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You have to give up some privacy,” Michelle, 50, said. “As a couple you might not do some of the things you would normally do as a couple – as newlyweds. ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Wink, wink, nod, nod,” Don added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In this case, we don’t want anything too long-term,” Don continued. “We want to go back to no roommates, that’s preferred for us. But for now, it makes economic sense. ”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">home sales plunge 6.4 percent in december</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home sales cratered in December, causing price growth to slip to the lowest level in nearly six years as the housing sector ended 2018 on a decidedly weak note. The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> says that sales of existing homes plunged 6.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.99 million last month, the worst pace in almost three years. For all of 2018, sales of existing homes fell 3.1 percent from a year ago to 5.34 million units, the softest total since 2015.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Housing market will be slower, steadier in 2019</span>
</div><div class="author">Janna Herron </div><div>1081 words</div><div>2 January 2019</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>B.1</div><div>ISSN:07347456</div><div>English</div><div>© 2019 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forget fevered bidding wars and snap home-buying decisions. Slower and steadier will characterize next year's housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That follows a 2018 that started off hot but softened into the fall as buyers – put off by high prices and few choices – sat out rather than paid up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Affordability issues will remain a top concern going into 2019, exacerbated by rising mortgage rates. But some of 2018's more intractable issues will begin to loosen up. The volume of for-sale homes is expected to rise and diversify, while the number of buyers is forecast to shrink.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For home sellers, they need to recognize those days of frenzied market are over. They must price competitively to sell their home," said Lawrence Yun, the chief economist at the National Association of Realtors. "For buyers, there will be challenges when it comes to rising interest rates, but they don't have to make hurried decisions anymore."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some cash-strapped first-time buyers will simply be priced out, while a cohort of potential move-up buyers will decide to stay in their existing home, make renovations and enjoy their current low mortgage rate. Price increases will moderate, and everyone in the market will need to adjust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, more homes to choose from</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the biggest complaints among buyers in the last several years is that there weren't enough homes for sale. In fact, the supply of houses hit historic lows in the winter of 2017 and has yet to rebound substantially. That fueled bidding wars, price increases and frustration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply crunch is expected to ease some in 2019 with inventory rising 10percent to 15percent, according to Yun. But the increase will be skewed toward the mid-to-high end of the market – houses priced $250,000 and higher – especially when it comes to newly built houses, said Danielle Hale, chief economist of realtor.com. That's good news for move-up buyers, but not so much for the first-time millennial buyer. "There's still a mismatch on the entry-level side," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Houses in all shapes and sizes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're a first-time buyer, you won't be completely out of luck if you stay open-minded. If a single-family home is out of the question, consider a mobile home or townhouse as a starter home, both of which are on the rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The volume of shipments for manufactured houses – also known as mobile homes – is expected to finish above 100,000 this year, up from 93,000 in 2017, according to Robert Dietz, chief economist of the National Association of Home Builders. The trend is expected to continue next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These homes are also significantly cheaper than other home types. Not including land costs, the cost to buy a mobile home averages $70,600, compared with $257,900 for an existing single-family home and $309,700 for a new home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You may also consider a townhouse, an attached single-family home located in a community of homes. Construction of townhomes also is experiencing year-over-year growth and is outpacing the single-family detached home market, Dietz said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The market is being supported by millennials moving from renting to their first-home purchase," he said. "If you're in a high-cost area with wage and job growth, townhouses are appropriate for entry-level. And they still get that suburban feel with their own front door."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Affording a home remains hard</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing values are still expected to increase next year, but not at the gang-buster pace seen in recent years. <span class="companylink">NAR</span>'s Yun forecasts modest price growth between 2percent and 3percent, down from close to 5percent this year and over 5percent in 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, mortgage rates are expected to hit 5.5percent by the end of 2019. Both factors make it more expensive for buyers to purchase a home. Hale estimates that the expected increase in prices and interest rates translates to an 8percent rise in the average monthly mortgage payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest rate trap</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shrinking affordability will convince some buyers – especially first-timers – to sit out the market altogether next year because they can't make the numbers work. Homeowners considering selling their home may also stay put because of rising mortgage rates – a so-called interest rate trap. Most outstanding mortgages have an interest rate of 4.5percent or less, according to a report this year from Black Knight, a data analytics firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They have a nice low mortgage rate, lower than the current rate, so there's no reason to move," said Mark Fleming, chief economist of First American Financial Corp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tax worries linger</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first few months of 2019 will reveal how the new tax changes affect homeowners. One key rule is the new cap on the mortgage interest deduction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before, homeowners could deduct interest they paid on up to $1million in mortgage debt – including interest on home equity loans and lines of credit – reducing their taxable income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, you can only deduct interest on up to $750,000 in mortgage debt. Interest paid on home equity loans and lines of credit is deductible only if the funds were used to pay for home improvements or renovations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only taxpayers who will exceed those limits are high-end homeowners and buyers and those with multiple homes with mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bigger question mark is if and how the $10,000 limit on state and local taxes deduction – known as SALT – will affect housing markets in high-tax states such as New Jersey, New York, Connecticut and California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers may be reluctant to purchase homes in those states – or choose a smaller house – if they calculate they will pay too much in non-deductible taxes. "These states may see softer housing markets compared to the rest of the country," said Yun, if the SALT cap hurts enough homeowners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bottom line</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're a seller: Price realistically and be ready to cut the listing price or offer other incentives to get a deal done. "It's still a seller's market, but not like it was," Hale said. "Sellers need to be mindful of competition, especially for more expensive properties."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're a buyer: Don't worry about going slow when making decisions. "There is less buyer competition and more inventory," Yun said. "Buyers can take time to find the home that fits into their budget."</p>

</div><div class="author">Paul Davidson </div><div>928 words</div><div>5 December 2018</div><div>USA Today Online</div><div>USATONL</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2018 USA Today Online. Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All rights reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keith and Kylie Beukema were bracing for a year-long slog as they started hunting for a larger home in the Denver area, one of the hottest housing markets in the country the past few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, it recently took them just two weeks to snag their four-bedroom dream house with mountain views in Thornton, paying $490,000 – $10,000 below asking price – after visiting just three other homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I was nervous (the seller) would laugh us off,” Kylie, a 29-year-old physician, says. “We figured we’d get into bidding wars” and almost certainly have to pay above list price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Denver epitomizes the slowdown taking hold this year in the nation's housing market as mortgage rates climb, home prices rise and the new tax law limits the benefits of ownership. Those hindrances are adding to a longer-standing obstacle to sales – low home supplies – and making the housing market across most of the country more favorable for buyers – if they can afford the added costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Definitely, there is a shift in the market,” says Lawrence Yun, chief economist of the National <span class="companylink">Association of Realtors (NAR)</span>. “Buyer activity appears to be softening . . . Buyers have more chances. ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While housing is still largely a seller’s market, it’s becoming less so and the playing field should be roughly balanced between buyers and sellers by mid-next year, says Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist of research firm Veritas Urbis Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think we are entering a (return) to normalcy,” McLaughlin says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales slip</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, existing home sales were down 2. 1 percent through the first nine months of the year compared with the same period in 2017. The prior three years, annual gains for home sales totaled 6. 3 percent, 3. 8 percent and 2. 7 percent, according to NAR. The realtors group on Friday reported a 3. 4 percent sales drop in September from the previous month to the lowest level since November 2015, though Hurricane Florence in the Carolinas contributed to the weak showing.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More: New York attorney general investigating whether MoviePass may have misled investors</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices for homesare still rising in general, although more slowly. In September the median price was up 4. 2 percent from a year earlier to $258,100, but that marked a pullback from gains of 5. 1 percent and 5. 7 percent in 2016 and 2017, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next year, NAR’s Yun expects flat sales and price increases of just 2 percent to 3 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, housing’s health varies by location. Generally, expensive Western markets such as Denver, San Francisco and Seattle had been posting double-digit yearly price gains that have slowed. More affordable areas such as Indianapolis and Grand Rapids, Michigan are still seeing price increases accelerate. And reasonably priced southern markets such as Atlanta remain hot, says Daryl Fairweather chief economist of real estate brokerage Redfin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even the still-vibrant markets could cool by late next year as housing costs continue to mount, says McLaughlin of Veritas Urbis Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, economists blamed softer sales gains on skimpy inventories that limited the pickings and drove up prices, discouraging some buyers. And the nation’s 4. 4 month supply of homes in September – the time it would take to exhaust the stockpile assuming no units were added – was still below a normal six months or so. While low, that was up from 4. 2 months a year ago, marking just the second annual increase since 2015, according to NAR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That’s largely because builders have responded to the shortages and put up more houses, mostly higher-priced units that can offset sharply rising labor and material costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher rates, fewer first-time buyers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, rising mortgage rates are playing a bigger role and compounding the effect of U. S. home prices that are up more than 50 percent since their 2012 bottom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fixed 30-year mortgage rates averaged 4. 85 percent for the week ending Oct. 18, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, up from 3. 88 percent a year ago. That bumps up the monthly payment on a typical $210,000 mortgage by about $125.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The higher rates are “making many people scared,” from first-time homebuyers to trade-up buyers seeking more expensive homes, Yun says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new tax law is also chilling some sales. It caps the deduction for property and state and local income taxes at $10,000. And it limits the mortgage interest deduction at home values up to $750,000, down from $1 million. The changes are tempering sales in states with more high-end houses, such as California, Connecticut, Illinois and New York, Yun says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, pent-up demand from first-time homebuyers – who have driven the market the past couple of years – may be starting to peter out, says Aaron Terrazas, chief economist of Zillow, a real estate research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slowdown could mean housing will provide less support for the economy. Builders might put up fewer homes, fearing weaker economic growth and reduced home sales in coming years, Terrazas says. Single-family housing starts are down 1. 7 percent so far this year. But he says the downshift will be nothing like the housing crash of the late 2000’s, which toppled the economy into recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is not 2008,” he says.</p>

</div><div class="author">Paul Davidson </div><div>570 words</div><div>9 November 2018</div><div>USA Today Online</div><div>USATONL</div><div>n/a</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2018 USA Today Online. Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All rights reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The million-dollar home is no longer such a rare species.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of U. S. homes valued at $1 million or more increased by 400,702 this year, the largest annual rise since the housing price recovery began in 2012, according to a new study by real estate research firm <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>. Slightly more than 3 million homes nationally, or 3. 6% of the total, are worth at least $1 million, up from 3. 1 percent last year and 1. 5 percent in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not surprisingly, many of the freshly minted million-dollar units are in California, which already boasts the most in the country. The San Jose and San Francisco metro areas have the largest shares of $1 million homes and also notched the biggest increases over the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, 29 cities and towns joined those with a median home value of $1 million or more this year, bringing the total to 201. Nineteen municipalities joined the million-dollar club last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They include San Jose, California, whose median value rose from $930,900 to $1. 09 million; Fremont, California ($966,000 to $1. 13 million); Burbank, California ($845,700 to $1. 01 million); Newton, Massachusetts ($977,200 to $1. 07 million); and Shelter Island, N. Y. ($903,500 to $1. 15 million)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Trulia</span> Senior Economist Cheryl Young attributed the big jump to widespread home price increases in recent years, with the median national home price climbing 7. 6 percent the past year to $220,100. The median, or midpoint, of all home prices is up 45. 3 percent since 2012. Housing demand has been strong while supplies are low, driving values higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Home values have been escalating… And at about $1 million, there’s even greater appreciation,” she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the roughly 15,100 larger neighborhoods around the country analyzed by <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>, 838 have median home values of $1 million or more and about two thirds of those are in California. Nearly 30 percent of California’s neighborhoods have a median home price of at least $1 million, the most by far of any state. New York, Florida and Washington followed.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many potential homebuyers are sitting out the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The volume of mortgage applications last week fell to the lowest level since December 2014, according to a new report from the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span>, providing another sign the housing market is slowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline was led by a 5 percent drop-off in purchase applications to a nearly two-year low, followed by a 3 percent decrease in applications to refinance an existing loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers are facing a trifecta of unfriendly housing conditions: short supply of homes, increasing prices and rising mortgage rates.

</div><div class="author">Paul Davidson </div><div>656 words</div><div>30 October 2018</div><div>USA Today Online</div><div>USATONL</div><div>n/a</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2018 USA Today Online. Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All rights reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising mortgage rates? Higher prices?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Millennials are shrugging off those growing housing-market obstacles and snapping up homes in greater numbers as they land better jobs and bigger raises. They’re also getting married and starting families after putting off those life-changing events.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The homeownership rate for Americans under 35 jumped to 36. 8 percent in the third quarter, highest in five years, the Census Bureau said Tuesday. The share of millennial homeowners was up sharply, from 36. 5 percent in the second quarter and 35. 6 percent a year earlier. That’s still below the historically normal 40 percent-plus share for Americans that age.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the young adults, largely first-time homebuyers, drove the national homeownership rate to 64. 4 percent – highest since 2014 – from 64. 3 percent the prior quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Surprise</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report was somewhat surprising in light of a housing market that has sputtered this year, with home sales falling amid low supplies and rising mortgage rates and prices. Thirty-year fixed mortgage rates averaged 4. 86 percent last week, up from 3. 94 percent a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But those hurdles have been offset by an improving labor market. Millennials who struggled to find jobs after the Great Recession of 2007 to 2009 are snagging ones that better match their skills and seeing bigger pay increases, says Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist of Veritas Urbis Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They had to come up with a down payment, they had to overcome bad credit,” McLaughlin says. “They still want to own homes. ”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while national home supplies are still low, they’ve gradually increased to 1. 91 million in September from 1. 86 million year ago, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Market slowdown helps</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Skylar Olsen, director of economic research for real estate site Zillow, says the slowing housing market actually has aided millennials who are facing somewhat less competition as they hunt for their first home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They’re going boldly forward to finally win one of those bids,” she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luke Gabig of Pittsburgh thought he and his fiancée, Gabi Garver, had snared their dream house two years ago only to have another buyer wrest it away at the last minute with an all-cash offer. “That was annoying,” the 26-year-old benefits administrator says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They decided to give up their search and continued to rent. But in August, they attended an open house for a three-bedroom ranch the first day it was put on the market and immediately offered $10,000 above the $150,000 asking price. They got it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After graduating from college in 2012, Gabig worked restaurant jobs because he couldn’t land a position in his field. He finally did in 2014 and has received healthy raises since then while Garver has gotten a job as a phlebotomist, a medical professional who draws blood, after earning a certification two years ago. The extra money is helping the couple afford their 10 percent down payment and $1,200 monthly mortgage installment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We just got lucky,” Gabig says of the purchase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A mountain of student loan debt prevented Nicholas Dwayne, 33, of Chicago, from buying a home for years. But his wife, Julie, has amassed healthy savings, allowing the couple to buy a two-bedroom $285,000 condo last year, before they got married.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Rent is throwing money down the drain,” Dwayne says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surge in millennial homeownership is a sign the recent housing slowdown is likely temporary, McLaughlin says. “Because that group is so big, it can help support the U. S. housing market indefinitely,” he says.</p>

</div><div class="author">Janna Herron </div><div>723 words</div><div>29 October 2018</div><div>USA Today Online</div><div>USATONL</div><div>n/a</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2018 USA Today Online. Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All rights reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Super-low inventory and quickly rising prices largely framed this year’s housing market. But a closer look at 2018’s buyers and sellers reveals other intriguing real estate trends, captured by a new report from the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are five big takeaways:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marriage not needed:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The share of married couple buyers hit the lowest point since 2010 at 63 percent. Single females made up the second-largest buyer group at 18 percent, following by single males at 9 percent and unmarried couples at 8 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline in married couples reveals that marriage is no longer a prerequisite to buying a home. “You don’t need a ring,” says Jessica Lautz, director of demographics and behavioral insight for the NAR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tough for first-timers:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low inventory for entry-level homes and rapid price increases continue to befuddle first-time homebuyers. This year, the share of first-time buyers fell to 33 percent, down from 34 percent last year and well below the historical norm of 40 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They didn’t bounce back,” Lautz says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost a quarter of first-time homebuyers (23 percent) moved directly from their parents’ homes before purchasing a house, a new high. Lautz notes that may be how some first-timers can compete in today’s market. “They’re not stuck in a lease and its time frame,” she says. “They can save for a down payment because they’re not paying rent. ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time homebuyers contributed a median 7 percent of the sales price to their home purchase, up from 5 percent last year and the highest level since 1997. Overall, buyers put down 13 percent, up from 10 percent in 2017 and the highest since 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Older repeat buyers:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Repeat buyers are getting older. The median age was 55 years, up from 54 last year and an all-time high for the survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lautz says that these younger Boomers are healthier than their counterparts in the past, so they don’t need to move to an assisted-living facility or downsize, which has become less and less common. “Many are purchasing multi-generational homes and taking care of parents, or their children are moving back home,” Lautz says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many homeowners who bought their homes eight to 10 years ago at the peak of the previous housing bubble also stalled their home sale as they waited to regain equity. That’s another reason repeat buyers could be older.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Student loan woes:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">College debt remains a significant challenge for potential homebuyers. Almost a quarter of all buyers reported having a median of $28,000 in student loan debt, while two in five first-time buyers said they had a median of $30,000 in education debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the 13 percent of buyers who said saving for a down payment was the hardest part of buying a home, half said their student loan debt had hampered their ability to save for a home purchase or down payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Even with a thriving economy and an abundance of job opportunities in many markets, monthly student loan payments coupled with sky-high rents and rising home prices make it exceedingly difficult for potential buyers to put aside savings for a down payment,” NAR’s chief economist, Lawrence Yun, said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fewer children:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The share of homebuyers with children under 18 reached the lowest point in the survey's 37-year history at 34 percent, mirroring recent low birthrates in the country, says Lautz. “This changes the neighborhoods buyers are looking at. Schools are a reduced preference. Some buyers may be willing to move to up-and-coming neighborhoods more than before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additionally, buyers without children may be content with houses with less than three bedrooms, no recreation room or even a townhouse or condo if they don’t see children in their future. Many buyers also are interested in how their homes work for their pets. Fifteen percent of buyers this year said it was important that their home is close to green spaces or a veterinarian for their pets. This is the first time the NAR posed this survey questions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s less about the babies with two legs,” Lautz says, “and more about the fur babies with four legs. ”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pool of buyers thinning, mortgage rates rising</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keith and Kylie Beukema were bracing for a yearlong slog as they started hunting for a larger home in the Denver area, one of the hottest housing markets in the country the past few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, it recently took them just two weeks to snag their four-bedroom dream house with mountain views in Thornton, paying $490,000 - $10,000 below asking price - after visiting just three other homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I was nervous (the seller) would laugh us off," said Kylie, a 29-year-old physician. "We figured we'd get into bidding wars" and almost certainly have to pay above list price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Denver epitomizes the slowdown taking hold this year in the nation's housing market as mortgage rates climb, home prices rise and the new tax law limits the benefits of ownership. Those hindrances are adding to a longer-standing obstacle to sales - low home supplies - and making the housing market across most of the country more favorable for buyers - if they can afford the added costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Definitely, there is a shift in the market," said Lawrence Yun, chief economist of the National Association of Realtors. "Buyer activity appears to be softening ... Buyers have more chances."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While housing is still largely a seller's market, it's becoming less so, and the playing field should be roughly balanced between buyers and sellers by the middle of next year, said Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist of research firm Veritas Urbis Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think we are entering a (return) to normalcy," McLaughlin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales slip</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, existing home sales were down 2.1percent through the first nine months of the year compared with the same period in 2017. The prior three years, annual gains for home sales totaled 6.3percent, 3.8percent and 2.7percent, according to <span class="companylink">NAR</span>. The Realtors group on Friday reported a 3.4percent sales drop in September from the previous month to the lowest level since November 2015, though Hurricane Florence in the Carolinas contributed to the weak showing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices for homes are still rising in general, although more slowly. In September the median price was up 4.2percent from a year earlier to $258,100, but that marked a pullback from gains of 5.1percent and 5.7percent in 2016 and 2017, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next year, <span class="companylink">NAR</span>'s Yun expects flat sales and price increases of just 2 to 3percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, housing's health varies by location. Generally, expensive Western markets such as Denver, San Francisco and Seattle had been posting double-digit yearly price gains that have slowed. More affordable areas such as Indianapolis and Grand Rapids, Michigan, are still seeing price increases accelerate. And reasonably priced Southern markets such as Atlanta remain hot, said Daryl Fairweather, chief economist of real estate brokerage Redfin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even the still-vibrant markets could cool by late next year as housing costs continue to mount, said McLaughlin of Veritas Urbis Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, economists blamed softer sales gains on skimpy inventories that limited the pickings and drove up prices, discouraging some buyers. And the nation's 4.4-month supply of homes in September - the time it would take to exhaust the stockpile assuming no units were added - was still below a normal six months or so. While low, that was up from 4.2 months a year ago, marking just the second annual increase since 2015, according to <span class="companylink">NAR</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's largely because builders have responded to the shortages and put up more houses, mostly higher-priced units that can offset sharply rising labor and material costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes linger longer on market</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Denver, housing inventory is up 16.1percent from a year ago, according to the Denver Metro Association of Realtors. Yet just 3,983 homes were sold last month, down from 4,994 a year earlier. The median sale price is off 5.9percent from its April peak of $455,000. And single-family homes were on the market an average 27 days, up from 19 days in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lisa Huntington-Kinn, a broker with Your Castle Real Estate in Denver, said the market started to sputter in July. Before, houses often drew dozens of bids and routinely sold for above asking price. Now, she said about 30percent of sellers have had to reduce their list price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As costs ratcheted higher, "a lot of buyers dropped out," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until summer, broker Van Lewis of RE/MAX Alliance in Aurora, Colorado, was having his best year ever. Since then, he said, monthly sales have fallen 50percent. He partly blames an influx of apartment buildings that are offering significant concessions, making renting more attractive than buying for many millennials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the tech-driven Denver economy is still robust, and wages are rising, "the spread between income and (purchase) costs became too much," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The thinning pool of buyers gave more leverage to the Beukemas, who wanted to move up from their smaller townhouse because they plan to start a family soon. Besides dropping the asking price, the seller also agreed to make the deal contingent on the Beukemas selling their townhouse by December - an allowance almost never granted during the go-go days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other side of the ledger is Holly Steele, 65. She eventually sold her Aurora townhouse in late September, but it took nearly three months instead of the two weeks she expected. And she had to drop the price three times, from $295,000 to $276,500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was getting a little stressful because I wanted to make my move" to Rapid City, South Dakota, before snow season, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rates rise, first-time buyers dip</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, rising mortgage rates are playing a bigger role and compounding the effect of U.S. home prices that are up more than 50percent since their 2012 bottom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fixed 30-year mortgage rates averaged 4.85percent for the week ending Oct.18, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, up from 3.88percent a year ago. That bumps up the monthly payment on a typical $210,000 mortgage by about $125.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The higher rates are "making many people scared," from first-time homebuyers to trade-up buyers seeking more expensive homes, Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new tax law is also chilling some sales. It caps the deduction for property and state and local income taxes at $10,000. And it limits the mortgage interest deduction at home values up to $750,000, down from $1million. The changes are tempering sales in states with more high-end houses, such as California, Connecticut, Illinois and New York, Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, pent-up demand from first-time homebuyers - who have driven the market the past couple of years - may be starting to peter out, said Aaron Terrazas, chief economist of Zillow, a real estate research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slowdown could mean housing will provide less support for the economy. Builders might put up fewer homes, fearing weaker economic growth and reduced home sales in coming years, Terrazas said. Single-family housing starts are down 1.7percent so far this year. But he said the downshift will be nothing like the housing crash of the late 2000s, which toppled the economy into recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is not 2008," he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices for homesare still rising in general, although more slowly. In September the median price was up 4. 2 percent from a year earlier to $258,100, but that marked a pullback from gains of 5. 1 percent and 5. 7 percent in 2016 and 2017, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next year, NAR’s Yun expects flat sales and price increases of just 2 percent to 3 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, housing’s health varies by location. Generally, expensive Western markets such as Denver, San Francisco, and Seattle that had been posting double-digit yearly price gains have slowed. More affordable areas such as Indianapolis and Grand Rapids, Mich. are still seeing price increases accelerate. And reasonably priced southern markets such as Atlanta remain hot, says Daryl Fairweather chief economist of real estate brokerage Redfin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even the still-vibrant markets could cool by late next year as housing costs continue to mount, says McLaughlin of Veritas Urbis Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, economists blamed softer sales gains on skimpy inventories that limited the pickings and drove up prices, discouraging some buyers. And the nation’s 4. 4 month supply of homes in September-- the time it would take to exhaust the stockpile assuming no units were added -- was still below a normal six months or so. While low, that was up from 4. 2 months a year ago, marking just the second annual increase since 2015, according to NAR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That’s largely because builders have responded to the shortages and put up more houses, mostly higher-priced units that can offset sharply rising labor and material costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes linger longer on market</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Denver, housing inventory is up 16. 1 percent from a year ago, according to the Denver Metro Association of Realtors. Yet just 3,983 homes were sold last month, down from 4,994 a year earlier. The median sale price is off 5. 9 percent from its April peak of $455,000. And single-family homes were on the market an average 27 days, up from 19 days in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lisa Huntington-Kinn, a broker with Your Castle Real Estate in Denver, says the market started to sputter in July. Before, houses often drew dozens of bids and routinely sold for above asking price. Now, she says about 30 percent of sellers have had to reduce their list price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As costs ratcheted higher, “a lot of buyers dropped out,” she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until summer, broker Van Lewis of RE/MAX Alliance in Aurora, Colo. was having his best year ever. Since then, he says, monthly sales have fallen 50 percent. He partly blames an influx of apartment buildings that are offering significant concessions, making renting more attractive than buying for many millennials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the tech-driven Denver economy is still robust and wages are rising, “The spread between income and (purchase) costs became too much,” he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The thinning pool of buyers gave more leverage to the Beukemas, who wanted to move up from their smaller townhouse because they plan to start a family soon. Besides dropping the asking price, the seller also agreed to make the deal contingent on the Beukemas selling their townhouse by December – an allowance almost never granted during the go-go days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other side of the ledger is Holly Steele, 65. She eventually sold her Aurora townhouse in late September but it took nearly three months instead of the two weeks she expected. And she had to drop the price three times, from $295,000 to $276,500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It was getting a little stressful because I wanted to make my move” to Rapid City, S. D. , before” snow season, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher rates, fewer first-time buyers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, rising mortgage rates are playing a bigger role and compounding the effect of U. S. home prices that are up more than 50 percent since their 2012 bottom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fixed 30-year mortgage rates averaged 4. 85 percent for the week ending Oct. 18, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, up from 3. 88 percent a year ago. That bumps up the monthly payment on a typical $210,000 mortgage by about $125.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The higher rates are “making many people scared,” from first-time homebuyers to trade-up buyers seeking more expensive homes, Yun says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new tax law is also chilling some sales. It caps the deduction for property and state and local income taxes at $10,000. And it limits the mortgage interest deduction at home values up to $750,000, down from $1 million. The changes are tempering sales in states with more high-end houses, such as California, Connecticut, Illinois and New York, Yun says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, pent-up demand from first-time homebuyers -- who have driven the market the past couple of years -- may be starting to peter out, says Aaron Terrazas, chief economist of Zillow, a real estate research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slowdown could mean housing will provide less support for the economy. Builders might put up fewer homes, fearing weaker economic growth and reduced home sales in coming years, Terrazas says. Single-family housing starts are down 1. 7 percent so far this year. But he says the downshift will be nothing like the housing crash of the late 2000’s, which toppled the economy into recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is not 2008,” he says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections &amp; Clarifications: An earlier version of this story misspelled the first name of Jon Reidy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A couple of years ago, freshly-minted college graduates Jon and Samantha Reidy crisscrossed North Carolina in search of a place to settle and buy a house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After hitting seven cities – including bustling millennial enclaves such as Charlotte, Durham and Raleigh – they decided that nearly all of those housing markets had gotten too expensive. So they picked under-the-radar Winston-Salem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, they bought a house there for $106,000, including repairs, and plan to stay in the area for decades. Jon is even hoping to convince his parents to move down from Agawam, Mass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We have no intention of leaving,” says the 24-year-old athletic trainer. Besides its mix of urban amenities and laid-back pace, “Winston was a place we could afford. ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 50 percent runup in U. S. home prices since 2011 is reshuffling the pecking order of hot housing markets. While many midsize metro areas that had been affordable, up-and-coming alternatives – such as Kansas City, Missouri; Nashville, Tennessee; Raleigh; and Salt Lake City – are still coveted by buyers, their sales are declining or increasing more slowly amid sharply rising prices and shrinking supplies.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, many smaller, more affordable markets – such as Boise, Idaho; Dayton, Ohio; Greenville, South Carolina; and Winston-Salem – are benefiting from an influx of new residents and home sales that continue to climb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Even the second-tier markets are getting a little too pricey for a lot of residents,” economist Adam Kamins of Moody’s Analytics says. “Home prices are not rising as rapidly in the (third-tier) markets … and if you can get a good job there you may find a better quality of life. ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In second-tier metro areas – ranked 26th to 50th by population – single-family house prices increased 10 percent in the 12 months ending in the first quarter to a median of $343,000, according to <span class="companylink">Moody’s</span> figures.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Nashville, the median home price was up 8. 6 percent annually at $263,000. That came on the heels of four consecutive years of double-digit price increases, <span class="companylink">Moody’s</span> figures show. In the city and just beyond, the median home price tops $300,000. Nashville is a hotbed for tech, health care and aerospace companies, and its vibrant downtown is a millennial magnet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the soaring prices have taken a toll. Homeowners devote 35. 1 percent of their monthly income to housing costs, up from a 27. 8 percent average over the past 13 years, according to ATTOM Data Solutions. Metro area sales fell 4. 3 percent in 2017 year and are down 0. 5 percent so far this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Things have slowed down,” says Sher Powers, an area broker and president of Greater Nashville Realtors. “It’s not a bad thing for the market. It can’t sustain itself endlessly. There has to be some correcting. It’s still a sellers’ market. "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daniel Williams, 32, and his wife searched for an entry-level house for three months and lost out on three bids before finally purchasing a three-bedroom in the Antioch community. But they had to shell out $220,000 for it, well above the $180,000 they had budgeted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It makes me nervous,” says Williams, an auto mechanic. “I’ve never owned a home before. ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Domestic net migration – the net number of people moving into the Nashville area after accounting for those moving out – slowed to 18,700 in 2017 after topping 20,000 for two years, according to Moody’s and Census Bureau data</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Kansas City, another midsize city, home prices jumped 10. 3 percent last year while sales fell about 10 percent, according to <span class="companylink">Moody’s</span>. Some buyers have been priced out, but there also just aren’t enough homes available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We put a house on the market and the same day it’s going to be sold,” says Andrea Sheridan, a broker and president of the Kansas City Regional Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, many smaller cities have a healthier balance of supply and demand, as well as lower prices. In third-tier markets, ranked 51 to 100 by population, prices rose 6. 4 percent to $246,000 in the first quarter from a year earlier – below the U. S. median of $264,000 – and sales were up about 1 percent, in line with the national average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Winston-Salem, home prices were up about 9 percent annually, but that followed just a 3 percent uptick over the previous two years. And the median price early this year was still a manageable $166,000. The share of monthly income needed to pay housing costs is 22. 8 percent, down from a 13-year-average of 24. 6 percent, ATTOMS figures show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Slow and steady has been the Winston way,” says Blake Ginther, owner of the Ginther Group realtors. Home sales leaped 23 percent in 2016 and another 22 percent last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides its affordable housing and temperate climate, the area – home to Hanesbrands clothing, tobacco giant <span class="companylink">R. J. Reynolds</span> and <span class="companylink">BB&amp;T</span> bank – has used its revived downtown and growing health care industry to draw retirees and some millennials, Ginther says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You can be away from the city, but you can still get there in 10 minutes,” says Reidy, the trainer whose three-bedroom house occupies a half-acre lot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Domestic net migration to the area rose to 4,300 last year from 3,000 in 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, however, some third-tier metro areas are getting pricier as they draw more residents. In Boise, a tech hub that has fast become a hip, more affordable alternative to larger cities such as Seattle and Portland, Oregon, the median house price was up 18. 4 percent early this year at $255,000. In Aida County, which includes, Boise, the median was $324,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet home sales were up 23 percent in 2017 and 2 percent the first half of this year despite historically low supplies, according to Moodys and Boise Regional Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We continue to be an attractive place,” says Gary Salisbury, a local broker and president of the realtors group.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts project 4% growth, most since '14</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After lackluster economic growth early this year, the government is expected to report this week that the nation's gross domestic product increased at the fastest pace in three years in the second quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The news isn't expected to be nearly as upbeat for home sales, which have been hampered by low supplies and rising costs. But business investment likely surged despite jitters over widening U.S. trade battles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite steady job and income growth, existing home sales have been curtailed by rising mortgage rates and skimpy supplies that have pushed up prices. Sales dipped in both April and May. And pending sales, which track accepted offers but not signed contracts, were weak in those two months as well, suggesting sales last month may been tepid as well, Nomura economist Lewis Alexander says. Economists expect the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> to report Monday that existing home sales rose a modest 0.9 percent in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.48 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home sales have faced supply constraints as well - there aren't enough construction workers and available lots to satisfy demand. After sales climbed 6.7 percent in May, economists expect the Commerce Department on Tuesday to announce a 2.8 percent decline for June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 670,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, Commerce releases its estimate of orders for long-lasting goods such as computers and factory equipment. Most closely watched is a measure that excludes aircraft and defense-related items and serves as a proxy for business investment. After that reading dipped 0.2 percent in May, economists estimate Commerce to report a healthy 0.7 percent increase in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers hunkered down early in the year after a holiday spending binge drained their pocketbooks and 2017 tax refunds were delayed. But by the second quarter, those tax refunds had arrived and federal tax cuts for this year were leaving more money in their paychecks. As a result, consumer spending likely fueled strong economic growth in the April-June period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, business investment likely grew briskly and federal government outlays advanced on higher defense spending, Alexander says. There was also a surge in soybean exports as overseas businesses loaded up on supplies before their countries' retaliatory tariffs against the U.S. kicked in. That likely means lower sales in the months ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But all told, economists estimate Commerce will announce Friday that the economy grew at a 4 percent annual rate in the second quarter. That would be the fastest pace since the third quarter of 2014.</p>

</div><div class="author">Paul Davidson </div><div>346 words</div><div>16 July 2018</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>B.2</div><div>ISSN:07347456</div><div>English</div><div>© 2018 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has downplayed the effect of U.S. trade skirmishes on the economy, and Fed policymakers have forecast a total of four interest rate hikes this year. But that was before President Donald Trump threatened another $200 billion in tariffs against China last week, raising the prospect of a global trade war.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Powell's testimony before Congress this week could reveal whether the Fed may slow the pace of rate increases amid the growing risks. Also this week: reports on retail sales, housing starts and industrial production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists estimate the Commerce Department will report Monday that retail sales overall grew a robust 0.6 percent last month. And Nomura economist Lewis Alexander figures a core measure - that excludes volatile items such as autos and gasoline - increased a healthy 0.4 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Powell generally has shrugged off U.S. trade fights with China and other countries, he acknowledged in a radio interview that they could weaken the economy if Trump's import tariffs lead to a sustained rise in consumer prices. Powell could provide a more detailed appraisal in testimony on the economy and interest rates before the Senate Banking Committee Tuesday and the <span class="companylink">House Financial Services Committee</span> Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trade standoffs have dinged business confidence, but industrial production has been bolstered by solid demand from American consumers and companies. Auto production also likely rebounded strongly last month after a fire at a parts supply factory disrupted output in May, Alexander says. After industrial production dipped 0.1 percent in May, economists expect the Fed on Tuesday to announce a 0.6 percent increase in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, the Commerce Department releases the latest figures on housing starts. Groundbreaking for new homes has been volatile because shortages of workers and available lots have partly offset strong demand. After starts jumped 5 percent in May, economists estimate they fell 1.7 percent in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.3 million.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spending on U.S. construction projects rose 0.4 percent in May, while April's figure was revised down - signs of uneven building despite economic growth. The Commerce Department says the uptick in May brought total construction spending to a seasonally adjusted all-time high of $1.31 trillion, 4.5 percent higher than a year ago. April's figure was revised down significantly to 0.9 percent from a 1.8 percent gain, which would have been the largest increase in 24 years.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian wildfire, trade disputes among factors</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If rising mortgage rates and a limited supply of homes weren't enough, add this factor to the list of things making houses pricier for Americans to buy and own: sky-high lumber costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lumber futures hit at an all-time high of $639 per 1,000 board feet on May 17, according to the <span class="companylink">Chicago Mercantile Exchange</span>, and although they've pulled back to $547 since then, they're still well above a market that has rarely climbed above $400 the past few decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result of the higher wood costs, the price of the average new single-family home has increased by almost $9,000 since January 2017, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>, a federation of state and local associations. At the end of April, the average price was $407,300.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Builders are becoming increasingly concerned about home affordability, especially in the entry-level market," Barclays analyst Pooja Sriram says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lumber prices have increased due to a confluence of factors. A severe Canadian wildfire, an ongoing trade dispute between the United States and Canada and limited rail capacity are the main culprits. Typically, up to 97 percent of American lumber imports come from Canada, and President Donald Trump recently imposed tariffs of more than 20 percent on Canadian lumber - making the import more expensive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some cases, builders have opted to pass the rising cost of lumber onto aspiring home buyers. This gives consumers two options: pay a higher premium for a new home or refuse to buy it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many consumers have opted for the latter, said Jerry Howard, NAHB chief executive officer. The number of new home sales have come in below analysts' expectations for three of the past fourth months reported. For example, in April, new home sales fell 1.5 percent to 662,000 on an annualized basis, short of the 680,000 Wall Street had forecast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Millenials are the age group most harmed by these rising prices for new homes. Fresh out of college, millenials have to pay off student loans, take on entry-level job positions and learn how to manage their personal finances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adding to that strain are rising mortgage costs. According to the most recent <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span> report, the current mortgage rate is 4.83 percent - a 0.7 percentage point increase from last year. With the <span class="companylink">NAHB</span>'s average price for a new single-family home of $407,300, recent home buyers are paying $135 more on their mortgages per month than buyers a year ago.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Will new home sales bounce back in May after a dip in April?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New data out Monday will show whether a strong economy and plentiful jobs were enough to offset the headwinds of higher mortgage rates and spur home buyers to snap up their new dream home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing is a key driver of the U.S. economy, as a healthy number of purchases of homes shows consumers' upbeat confidence in the future and also spurs spending on home-related goods such as furniture, rugs and accessories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street is forecasting a 1 percent increase in new home sales in May compared to April. Analysts are looking for sales to tick up to 669,000 units on an annualized basis, up from 662,000 in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newly built home sales have been recovering steadily, driven by strong consumer demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But rising mortgage rates "remain a concern," Nomura economist Lewis Alexander noted in a report. The rising rate environment is both spurring sales and holding them back, Alexander said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The prospect of rising rates could compel consumers on the fence to participate in the market to avoid higher mortgage rates later, but recent rate increases have made it more difficult for first-time buyers to enter the market," Alexander said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market may be at a turning point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While demand remains strong amid sturdy job and income growth, limited supplies and rising prices and mortgage rates threaten to take an increasing toll on sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a light week of economic news, reports on builder sentiment, housing starts and existing home sales could help clarify the outlook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builder confidence has been fairly strong as a result of the healthy demand for single-family homes, but rising material costs may be dampening contractors' optimism, Nomura economist Lewis Alexander said. Climbing mortgage rates also could be playing a role.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, economists expect the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> to announce Monday that its builder sentiment index edged up in June to a solid level after dipping the previous month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts fell 3.7percent in April, but that was driven by a sharp decline in groundbreakings for volatile multifamily projects, Alexander noted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, tight housing supplies continue to fuel demand for single-family homes, though construction worker shortages and the limited availability of lots have tempered building activity. Economists estimate the Commerce Department will report Tuesday that housing starts rose 1.7percent in May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.3million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> releases its monthly report on existing home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales have been choppy, falling 2.5percent in April, because of the supply crunch and the higher prices and mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thirty-year fixed mortgage rates rose the past week after falling for two consecutive weeks. They're now at 4.62percent, up from 4.15percent early in the year, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet pending home sales increased in February and March, Alexander noted, and despite a modest decline in April, that should point to an increase in completed sales for May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists estimate the <span class="companylink">NAR</span> will announce that existing home sales rose 1.8percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.6million.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business started in contaminated parking lot</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The purchase of three properties by President Trump's son-in-law on the banks of a toxic Brooklyn canal triggered a series of unusual real estate deals and a windfall profit from transactions financed by a bank tied to the Trump family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property transactions began in late 2014 and early 2015 and included sales prices well above the assessed value of the parcels, as well as high-risk loans that experts said raise red flags. At the center of each deal is Jared Kushner and Michael Cohen, whose business dealings have attracted close scrutiny from prosecutors and regulators since Trump's election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The transactions were financed through <span class="companylink">Signature Bank</span>, one of three banks whose ties to Kushner are under review by New York banking regulators. The bank's board members have included Ivanka Trump and former Republican U.S. senator Al D'Amato, a deal maker and power broker in New York business and politics who has been a vocal supporter of President Trump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's unclear whether these deals are part of the state's review. These previously unreported details shed light on how Trump's closest associates conducted business in the high-stakes New York City real estate market and how Cohen benefited personally from his relationship to Trump and his businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">USA TODAY</span> asked six real estate, finance and tax law experts to review aspects of the real estate deals and mortgages. Each said the deals could be perfectly legal, but the timing of the transactions and the fact that so many related parties were involved make them highly unusual and raise red flags about the rapid inflation of property values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Michael Cohen did not respond to questions, nor did <span class="companylink">Kushner Companies</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signature Bank spokeswoman Susan Lewis said of the bank's relationship with Cohen that "senior management did not have any knowledge of him or who he was until he started appearing in the newspapers in the last year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brooklyn deal</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The series of deals involving Trump associates started in a contaminated parking lot on the banks of Brooklyn's Gowanus Canal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October 2014, a joint venture led by <span class="companylink">Kushner Companies</span> paid $72.5 million for three lots of land along the polluted waterway to a company owned by New York developer Herbert Chaves. Jared Kushner's company was a 5% shareholder in the venture, and commercial real estate company SL Green held the rest. Real estate and lobbying records indicate the Kushner firm was the operational leader of the venture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chaves' firms used cash from Kushner to buy apartments from Trump attorney Michael Cohen. He paid $32 million for four buildings Cohen bought one to three years before for $11.4 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The collective market value of the four properties at the time of the sale Dec. 10, 2014, was a total of $6.6 million, according to New York City property assessment records -- roughly one-fifth of the purchase price. Chaves did not take out any mortgages for his purchase of the four properties on the Lower East Side and Kip's Bay area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal was part of what is known as a "1031 exchange," which refers to a section of the Internal Revenue Code that lets a seller defer tax payments by rolling proceeds from one real estate deal into another within 45 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cohen immediately reinvested his new $32 million in a 1031 exchange of his own, part of which involved Chaves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In February 2015, Chaves and Cohen partnered on the purchase of a Manhattan apartment building at 330 East 63rd St. for $58 million. Aspects of the swaps involving Cohen and Chaves have been reported by McClatchy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The earlier deal, between Kushner and Chaves, is similar to the Chaves and Cohen deal under scrutiny.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The purchase price in the Kushner deal far exceeded the assessed market value, which was $3 million at the time of the sale, according to city records. A newly opened <span class="companylink">Whole Foods</span> in the area served as a sign of the transitional neighborhood's promise, but the ideal location was on land spoiled from decades of industrial use.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 3.2-acre canal-front property, used as a parking lot for utility service vehicles, features views of a waterway strewn with debris, including a sideways shopping cart and overturned stroller. Former tenants -- including a wagon painter, blacksmith, auto wrecking facility and gas station -- left volatile organic compounds in the soil and groundwater. The property was not zoned for residential development, limiting what could be done with the land absent an approved zoning change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts who reviewed details of the transaction said they were struck by the high purchase price, given the level of contamination on the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
David Zimmel, president of Zimmel Associates, a New Jersey commercial real estate company that does business in New York, said he was surprised the Kushner-led team would pay that much for property without guarantees that it would recover its investment. "It's crazy money," he said. "To pay that kind of money and not be sure, I'm surprised."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property's environmental issues made it a risky proposition for any bank looking to back a development venture. If the site couldn't be decontaminated, the property was never going to be much more than it was -- an eyesore where Verizon parked vehicles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The transaction in October 2014 was backed by a $40 million mortgage from <span class="companylink">Signature Bank</span>. Ivanka Trump was a member of <span class="companylink">Signature Bank</span>'s board of directors from 2011 to 2013, according to <span class="companylink">Securities and Exchange Commission</span> filings. She served on its risk committee, which reviewed high-value loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Catherine Ghiglieri, a former banking commissioner of Texas and co-author of two books on banking, said banks have policies to make loans, and if there is toxic waste on a site where no cleanup is underway, the "bank will not loan money unless there is some mitigating circumstances."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They are lending other people's money," she said. "They are not venture capitalists."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lewis said <span class="companylink">Signature Bank</span> "is fully compliant" with <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> regulations, "meaning any member of the board of directors cannot have any involvement in the approval process for any loans to which he or she is related, including those of family members."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the 31/2 years the property was owned by the Kushner joint venture, efforts to develop the land hinged on clearing environmental and rezoning hurdles to unlock its potential value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kushner's company applied in 2015 to the <span class="companylink">New York State Department of Environmental Conservation</span>'s Brownfield Cleanup Program for funding to remove contaminants from the land, and it was approved that year. The state installed monitoring wells to investigate contamination on the site, and an investigation report is being finalized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York City lobbying records show the Kushner venture poured $180,000 in 2015 and 2016 into an effort to lobby city officials to rezone the land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City Councilman Brad Lander, who was among the lobbied officials, said he began to have serious issues with the Kushner group after the election when Kushner became a White House adviser.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lander said he became concerned that the White House, which controls the Superfund cleanup programs, could retaliate against the district and not allow the cleanup to continue if the city didn't go along with the team's demands. On the other hand, if he and the city voted in favor of the Kushner team, it would look like he and his colleagues were looking to help Kushner, who held a financial stake in the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kushner joint venture sold the land in April 2018 despite the fact it remains zoned in a manufacturing district and the cleanup is in progress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kushner group's profit was substantial: The property purchased for $72.5 million in 2014 was sold to the international property firm RFR Holding for $115 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lander said he's not sure if zoning issues prompted the team to sell, "or if it has something to do with the Kushner family's well-publicized need for cash." The property remains a parking lot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'Let them look'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interactions between <span class="companylink">Signature Bank</span> and Cohen and Kushner did not end with the property sales in 2014 and 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cohen used his real estate investments to generate extra cash from <span class="companylink">Signature Bank</span> last year, according to state records. In May 2017, a financing document was filed with the New York secretary of State by the five corporations through which Cohen and Chaves own 330 East 63rd St.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The financing document, which has not previously been reported, establishes those corporations are offered as collateral for a loan against the equity in the apartment building, according to experts who reviewed the records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is unclear how much was extracted from the loan or how any funds drawn from the financing were used.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York real estate attorney Michael Zuckerman of Warshaw Burstein, who specializes in real estate finance, said it is possible the financing statement indicates a loan was taken out to aid other ventures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cohen faced complications in the early months of the Trump presidency, including questioning by congressional committees last year and the seizure of his business records by the U.S. Attorney's Office in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reached by phone, Cohen asked for written questions but did not respond.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Signature Bank</span> was among the banks that received requests this year from <span class="companylink">New York's Department of Financial Services</span> for records of its interactions with Kushner. The department did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview with the real estate publication The Real Deal this month, Kushner's father, Charles, called the request "nonsense."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Let them look. We welcome them to look," he said. "What do they want from our files? What do they want from the bank's files? All of our banks have ... called us and said, 'Give them whatever you have because it's stupid.'"</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buying a home has turned into a version of the TV game show Jeopardy! -- if you don't act with lightning speed, you lose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. homes that sold in April -- meaning final contracts were signed -- were listed an average of just 64 days, the fastest turnaround since the housing crash and recession from 2007 to 2009, according to the latest figures from real estate research firm <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>. That's down from the previous low of 71 days, set last July. Compare those numbers to April 2010, when houses languished for 137 days before sales were completed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That period includes not only time between a house being listed and an offer accepted, but the entire process -- inspection, appraisal and loan approval, which sometimes results in renegotiated offers and canceled sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it comes to just the period between when a house was listed for sale and when an offer to buy was accepted, the average in April was a scant 26 days, also a post-recession low, <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Things are moving quickly," <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> housing economist Felipe Chacon says. "You need to have your ducks in a row."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A strong job market that's fueling demand and near-record low supplies of homes for sale is forcing house hunters to make offers quickly -- sometimes sight unseen. There was a four-month supply of homes on the market in April compared to a normal six-month inventory, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing takes the spotlight in this week's economic news, with reports coming out on new and existing home sales. Also on tap: the latest business investment figures and minutes of the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>'s early May meeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's plenty of demand for newly built homes, driven by Americans' solid job and income growth and a shortage of existing houses. But construction firms are struggling to find workers and lots, making for volatile sales month to month. And in April, cold weather likely curbed purchases, Nomura economist Lewis Alexander says, following a 4% increase the prior month. Economists expect the Commerce Department on Wednesday to report that new home sales fell 2% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 680,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>'s May 1-2 meeting was fairly humdrum as the central bank didn't raise its key short-term interest rate after bumping it up a quarter percentage point in March. But as usual, the Fed's post-meeting statement featured some subtle signals that could be clarified by a summary of the gathering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With inflation rising close to its 2% annual goal, the Fed dropped its previous assertion that it's "monitoring inflation closely."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, the Fed may not need to accelerate its rate hikes simply because inflation edges above 2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales have been choppy because of limited housing supplies. After sales rose in February and March, economists are looking for a modest pullback. The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> on Thursday is expected to report existing home sales dipped 0.5% in April to an annual rate of 5.6 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, Commerce releases its April report on orders for long-lasting goods such as computers, aircraft and factory equipment.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A New York condo has gone up for sale with a marketing gimmick that few other properties can match - a trip for two to outer space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Judging from its listing, this is about more than a condo, it’s a one-price entry into the world of the super-rich.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a mere $85 million, not only can you pick up a 45th-floor condo with breathtaking New York views, but a yacht, a pair of Rolls-Royce Phantoms, a Lamborghini, dinner for two weekly at swanky Restaurant Daniel, a Hamptons summer rental, a chef and butler for a year and, yes, a trip to outer space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More Money: New construction: Housing starts fall as US home building slides 3. 7% in April</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More Money: At New York's Trump Tower, condo prices have lost their glitter</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More Money: Housing affordability: Mortgage rates are surging to the highest level in 7 years</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s unclear by what means the buyer and a friend will launch into space. The listing doesn’t say. But such trips have certainly been offered for sale in the past. A decade ago, Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic, for instance, was selling seats on his planned space plane for $200,000 and later, $250,000. It’s yet to carry paying passengers even though the program is active and testing again. Given a 2014 crash, those who plunked down the reservations may now not be a big hurry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the condo, it’s being offered by a real estate developer, Daniel Neiditch. The condo is in the exclusive Atelier building that’s reportedly home to a slew of celebrities. It has 10 bedrooms, 11 bathrooms and 15,000 square feet. It takes up the whole 45th floor and part of the 44th.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American consumers have been caught in the middle of several crosscurrents this year. Lower taxes but higher gasoline prices. Solid job growth but delayed tax refunds. Higher pay, but not by all that much. Retail sales figures in April should provide a good gauge of whether a rebound the prior month signaled a sustained upswing in consumer spending after a lackluster start to the year. The week also brings reports on housing starts and industrial production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retail sales jumped 0.6% in March after dips the previous two months. And a core reading that excludes volatile categories such as autos and gasoline climbed a healthy 0.4%. The soft numbers early in the year were blamed partly on chilly weather and delays in tax refunds that should have arrived by February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the tax cut Congress passed late last year is leaving Americans with more money in their paychecks, though that has been partly offset by higher gas prices. Still, monthly job growth has averaged a sturdy 200,000 this year. And wages are up 2.6% from a year ago, according to the monthly jobs report. That's respectable, but it marks a slowdown from prior months. Overall, consumption is likely to accelerate as pay increases pick up in a tight labor market. Economists expect the Commerce Department on Tuesday to report a solid 0.3% gain in retail sales for April. Nomura economist Lewis Alexander estimates the core reading also rose 0.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, Commerce releases housing start numbers. Groundbreaking on new homes has been volatile this year. A strong labor market and meager housing supplies have driven demand, but construction worker shortages and colder weather have tempered building activity. Housing starts increased 1.9% in March. Economists estimate housing starts were flat last month at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.3 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industrial production generally has trended higher amid a pickup in oil drilling and healthy overseas demand. Business investment also has been solid, fueled partly by the tax cut. All told, economists figure the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> will announce that industrial production rose 0.6% last month.</p>

</div><div class="author">Paul Davidson </div><div>427 words</div><div>23 April 2018</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>B.2</div><div>ISSN:07347456</div><div>English</div><div>© 2018 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spring is here, and that means it's time for another potentially disappointing report on first-quarter economic growth. The economy has routinely underperformed early in the year, though many economists attribute the poor showings to government measurement problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A busy week of economic news also brings fresh readings on consumer confidence, new and existing home sales and business investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales have been choppy, largely because of supply shortages. Cold weather in March likely curtailed purchases, Nomura economist Lewis Alexander says. Also, climbing house prices and mortgage rates are partly offsetting healthy demand fueled by solid job and income growth. After existing home sales rose 3% in February, economists expect the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> on Monday to report a modest 0.2% bump in March to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.55 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home sales face similar hurdles. Home building is picking up but has been limited by shortages of construction workers and available lots, as well as stringent regulations in many cities. Unseasonably cold temperatures last month also played a role. After new home sales fell for three months, the Commerce Department is projected Tuesday to record a 1.4% rise for March to an annual rate of 627,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer confidence has hovered close to the 18-year high reached in February on the healthy labor market, still-high stock prices and recent tax cuts, Alexander says. But growing trade standoffs between the U.S. and China likely damped Americans' outlook somewhat, he says. Economists expect the <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span> to report a modest dip in its consumer confidence index for April to a level that remains elevated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, Commerce releases a report on business purchases of computers, appliances, factory equipment and other long-lasting goods. Economists estimate core capital goods orders excluding aircraft and defense rose a sturdy 0.6% last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After growing at a better than 3% annual rate the last nine months of 2017, the economy appears due for a characteristic first-quarter slowdown. Consumer spending, which makes up 70% of economic activity, was weak early in the year, Barclays Chief Economist Michael Gapen says. Business spending and stockpiling, he says, probably posted solid growth but residential investment sagged. All told, economists expect Commerce on Friday to estimate the economy grew at a 2.1% annual rate the first three months of the year. Gapen, however, thinks the measurement problems will help trim that to 1.5%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Houston Texans</span> aren't even bothering with the pretense.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On their website is a photo gallery of the finalists from last weekend's cheerleader tryouts, and visitors are encouraged to vote for their favorites. Are these action shots of the women that highlight their athletic ability or dance skills? Do they include a list of their qualifications?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course not. They're head shots. Sorry, head and chest shots. Close-up ones, at that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The better to ogle, you know.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cheerleaders from two <span class="companylink">NFL</span> teams have filed gender discrimination complaints in the past month, detailing the demeaning ways in which they were treated. Restrictions on what they can and can't post on social media. Rules that prohibit contact with players and put the onus on the women to avoid it. Dress codes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is it any wonder? The underlying premise of <span class="companylink">NFL</span> cheerleaders is degrading, presenting women as nothing more than objects to be leered at. With skimpy, suggestive outfits as their "uniform," their only purpose is to titillate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's always been an appalling message to send and, in this #MeToo era, there's no longer any place for it. <span class="companylink">NFL</span> cheerleaders need to go. <span class="companylink">NBA</span> dance squads and <span class="companylink">NHL</span> ice girls while we're at it, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not a criticism of cheerleading overall. In some forms, it very much is an athletic endeavor, a hybrid of acrobatics and gymnastics. The <span class="companylink">International Olympic Committee</span> has even recognized cheerleading as a sport and it could some day make an appearance in the Games.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Proponents will say that most women who are <span class="companylink">NFL</span> cheerleaders are professionally trained dancers who just want the opportunity to do what they love.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That they play an important role in maintaining the team's positive image with promotional appearances and community service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of which is true.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I was always out in the community," said Kristan Ann Ware, a former Miami Dolphins cheerleader who has filed a complaint with the Florida Commission on Human Relations alleging that she was discriminated against for talking about her faith and bullied after saying she was a virgin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you take away the cheerleaders, you take away the glue. You take away the puzzle piece that brings football to life."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that isn't the real reason 26 of the 32 <span class="companylink">NFL</span> teams have cheerleaders, and everybody knows it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They're there to be eye candy, blow-up dolls come to life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why else would the <span class="companylink">Dallas Cowboys</span> mandate that women wear sports bras and hot pants for tryouts -- "No tank tops or bike shorts" -- and include "personal appearance" and "figure" as criteria on which they are judged?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ben-Gals, who once generously granted a 3-pound "leniency weight," now say that "fitness is very important. You must be in good physical condition and proportioned for your height." Whatever that means.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, of course, almost every team with cheerleaders has its own swimsuit calendar, and many news media outlets, including <span class="companylink">USA TODAY</span>, publish cheerleader photos to generate reader interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When you're on the <span class="companylink">NFL</span> team as a cheerleader, it's like they have a sense of control over you," Ware said. "It does teach women that your life doesn't matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're told from day one that all they need is a pretty girl in a uniform."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">NFL</span> has a long history of disregarding and demeaning women, only acknowledging them when it suits the league's financial interests. Few teams have female executives, even fewer have female owners. Despite efforts at the league level to address domestic violence, owners mostly ignore it, disciplining or cutting players only when there's a public outcry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The objectification of cheerleaders is yet one more example.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some owners understand that. Of the 32 teams, there are six -- the <span class="companylink">Chicago Bears</span>, <span class="companylink">Buffalo Bills</span>, <span class="companylink">Cleveland Browns</span>, <span class="companylink">New York Giants</span>, <span class="companylink">Detroit Lions</span> and <span class="companylink">Green Bay Packers</span> -- that don't have cheerleaders. The <span class="companylink">Los Angeles Rams</span> just added two men to their squad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Philosophically we have always had issues with sending scantily clad women out on the field to entertain our fans," John Mara, the Giants co-owner, told The <span class="companylink">New York Times</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Good for Mara for speaking out. Too bad he said that eight years ago, and the rest of the league has not caught on.</p>

</div><div class="author">Paul Davidson </div><div>409 words</div><div>16 April 2018</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>B.2</div><div>ISSN:07347456</div><div>English</div><div>© 2018 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retail sales have fizzled for three consecutive months, a slump economists have blamed on various factors, including delayed tax refunds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A rebound is expected when the government reports March sales this week, but another disappointing showing likely will raise doubts about this year's prospects for consumer spending, which is the chief driver of economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also on tap: reports on housing starts and industrial production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers haven't been backing up their bullish outlooks at the cash register. Consumer confidence has hovered near 18-year highs. But retail sales dipped from December through February, with economists pointing to credit-card debt, cold January weather and, most recently, delays in federal tax refunds. Those refund checks have arrived, and consumers also should be fully aware of some extra money in their paychecks as a result of the federal tax cuts Congress passed last year. In other words, there's not much excuse for another lousy report. If the divide between Americans' optimism and spending persists, it "may increase the risk that personal spending does not respond to the recent personal tax cuts as strongly as we expected," Nomura economist Lewis Alexander says. Economists expect the Commerce Department on Monday to announce a healthy 0.4% increase in retail spending for March and a 0.3% rise in a core measure that excludes volatile categories such as autos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, Commerce provides the latest reading on another key sector of the economy -- home building. Housing starts have been choppy lately and fell 7% in February, largely because of big swings in volatile apartment construction. Groundbreaking on single-family houses has advanced solidly as builders move to respond to low home supplies that have driven up prices, though they've been slowed by shortages of workers and lots. Colder weather also may have posed a hurdle, Alexander says. All told, economists expect Commerce to report a modest 2.4% rebound in housing starts to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.27 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industrial production generally has been posting sturdy gains on the back of a robust global economy and rising oil prices that have boosted drilling activity. And colder temperatures in March likely spurred more output by utilities, Alexander says. Economists expect the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> to record a solid 0.3% increase in industrial production last month after a 1% jump in February.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tight supplies, rising prices make it tough for many</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This spring home-buying season should be a coming-out party for Millennials, many of whom are finally ready to make a purchase after hunkering down for years in their parents' basements or expensive apartments.The only problem: Much of the food at the party is gone, and what's left is priced like caviar.Although solid job and income growth is emboldening many prospective home buyers, record low housing supplies are driving up prices and curbing sales, especially for Millennials looking to buy starter homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For home buyers, this is shaping up to be one of the most difficult years in recent memory," says Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist of Veritas Urbis Economics, which studies the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For sellers, it will be a standout spring that brings big profits, unless sellers themselves are looking to buy a larger home in the same metro area. Already, house hunters are waiving inspections, making offers without even seeing homes and bidding well above asking price. Yet Lawrence Yun, chief economist of the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors (NAR)</span>, predicts sales will be flat compared to spring 2017 because of skimpy supplies and reduced affordability for many buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the hottest markets in recent years -- such as Seattle, Las Vegas and San Jose -- have continued to post double-digit annual price increases. Now, they've been joined by cities such as Nashville, Salt Lake City and Kansas City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why? Too many buyers chasing too few homes. In February, there was a 3.4-month supply of existing homes nationally, lowest on record for that month and substantially below a balanced six-month inventory, <span class="companylink">NAR</span> says. The number of starter homes is down 14.2% in the first quarter from a year ago, real estate research firm <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not that there aren't buyers' markets. Sales have dipped over the past year in Hartford, Conn., Toledo, Ohio, and Baton Rouge and were flat in Philadelphia and Baltimore, according to Attom Data Solutions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet nationally, the median home price in February was up 5.9% from a year earlier to $241,700, <span class="companylink">NAR</span> says. Meanwhile, average yearly wage growth has been stuck at about 2.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Las Vegas area, the median home price has jumped about 12% over the last year and doubled the past five years, Attom figures show. Homes priced below $200,000 typically draw 15 to 20 offers, says Chris Bishop, managing broker of Coldwell Banker Premier Realty. To stand out, some bidders are writing letters to sellers, detailing what they like about the house, says Rob Pistone, a broker at Keller Willians Realty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes typically stay on the market 41 days, down from 52 days a year ago and a typical six months. Besides Millennials, demand is fueled by "boomerang buyers" who may have lost homes to foreclosure during the housing crisis and recently repaired their credit, Bishop says. Las Vegas was hit especially hard by the crash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Area sales soared 34% in 2017 but fell 5% in February in a possible sign the supply crunch is damping activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Millennials, in particular, aren't short on enthusiasm. More than a third of all home purchases were made by Millennials in the 12 months ending last July, making the group the most active generation of buyers, according to a <span class="companylink">NAR</span> survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, builders are grappling with construction worker shortages that have delayed projects and driven up prices, as well as soaring material costs, limited land availability and onerous regulations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing homeowners, particularly Generation Xers, would like to move to bigger homes but fear not finding one or having to shell out much more for it, especially with average 30-year fixed mortgage rates at 4.4%, up from less than 4% last year. Many Baby Boomers, meanwhile, are delaying retirement and staying in current homes longer as well, McLaughlin says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compounding the logjam is the tax overhaul. It caps the mortgage interest deduction at home values up to $750,000, down from $1 million, for homes bought after Dec. 15, discouraging some high-end buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home buyers are girding for a battle. About a quarter are willing to offer more than asking price and 40% plan to put down more than 20% when they make a purchase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bottom line: Many existing homeowners are staying put, further limiting the supply of starter homes and pushing up their prices.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This spring home-buying season should be a coming-out party for Millennials, many of whom are finally ready to make a purchase after hunkering down for years in their parents’ basements or expensive apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only problem: Much of the food at the party is gone, and what’s left is priced like caviar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although solid job and income growth is emboldening many prospective home buyers, record low housing supplies are driving up prices and curbing sales, especially for Millennials looking to buy starter homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“For home buyers, this is shaping up to be one of the most difficult years in recent memory,” says Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist of Veritas Urbis Economics, which studies the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For sellers, it will be a standout spring that brings big profits, unless those sellers themselves are looking to buy a larger home in the same metro area. “It’s going to have the feel of a hot market,” marked by multiple offers and bidding wars, says Lawrence Yun, chief economist of the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors (NAR)</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More: Hot housing market: home buyers are spending more than expected</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More: Exclusive: <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> to donate $50M to train construction workers, address severe shortage</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already, house hunters are waiving inspections, making offers without even seeing homes and bidding well above asking price. Yet Yun predicts sales will be flat compared to spring 2017 because of the skimpy supplies and reduced affordability for many buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This year’s (spring) buyers may be competing against some of those buyers who have been unsuccessful during the past few months,”&nbsp;Zillow Senior Economist Aaron Terrazas says. “Increasingly, the traditional seasonal boundaries around home shopping season … are becoming less pronounced” as the fierce competition forces buyers to lengthen their searches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the hottest markets in recent years - such as Seattle, Las Vegas and San Jose - have continued to post double-digit annual price increases. Now, they’ve been joined by cities such as Nashville, Salt Lake City and Kansas City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why? Too many buyers chasing too few homes. In February, there was a 3. 4-month supply of existing homes nationally, the lowest on record for that month and substantially below a balanced six-month inventory, NAR says. The number of starter homes is down 14. 2% in the first quarter from a year ago, according to real estate research firm <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not that there aren't buyers' markets. &nbsp;Sales have dipped over the past year in Hartford, Conn. , Toledo, Ohio, and Baton Rouge&nbsp;and were flat in Philadelphia and Baltimore, according to Attom Data Solutions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet nationally, the median home price in February was up 5. 9% from a year earlier to $241,700, according to NAR. &nbsp;Meanwhile, average yearly wage growth has been stuck at about 2. 5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A crapshoot in Vegas</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Las Vegas area, the median home price has jumped about 12% over the last year and doubled the past five years, Attom figures show. Homes priced below $200,000 typically draw 15 to 20 offers, says Chris Bishop, managing broker of Coldwell Banker Premier Realty. &nbsp;To stand out, some bidders are writing letters to sellers, detailing what they like about the house, says Rob Pistone, a broker at Keller Willians Realty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes&nbsp;typically stay on the market 41 days, down from 52&nbsp;days a year ago and a typical six months. Besides Millennials, demand is fueled by “boomerang buyers” who may have lost homes to foreclosure during the housing crisis and recently repaired their credit, Bishop says. Las Vegas was hit especially hard by the crash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We just don’t have enough affordable housing,” says Bishop, who is president of the Greater Las Vegas Association of Realtors. Sales in the area soared 34% in 2017 but fell 5% in February in a possible sign the supply crunch is damping activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maria Maneva, 37, a Las Vegas escrow officer, is looking to move to a larger house now that she and her boyfriend have a 3-month-old daughter. They’ve seen little of interest in their price range of $300,000 to $400,000 and anything appealing sells within a day or even hours, Maneva says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So when she saw a four-bedroom house she liked,&nbsp;she made an instant offer at the asking price of $405,900. And when the seller began leaning toward a rival all-cash offer, she upped her bid by $600 and her agent - Jason Mattson of Orange Realty -&nbsp; agreed to lend her the entire amount in cash. &nbsp;She still didn’t get the house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, she says, “I will make an offer without even looking at” a house, she says. &nbsp;“I'm even more scared. "&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Millennials are more than ready</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Millennials, in particular,&nbsp;aren’t short on enthusiasm. “The first-time home buyer is eager,” says Joe&nbsp;Melendez, CEO of ValueInsured, which insures homebuyers against house price declines. “They’ve decided they want to be homeowners. ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thirty-six percent of adults under 35 owned a home in the fourth quarter, up from 34. 1% in early 2016, according to Veritas and Census Bureau figures. That’s still below a historically normal 40%. But more than a third of all home purchases were made by Millennials in the 12 months ending last July, making the group the most active generation of buyers, according to an NAR survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many are finally getting married and starting families after putting off those life-changing events. And their household income has risen to $88,200 from $82,000 a year ago, the NAR survey shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, builders are grappling with construction worker shortages that have delayed projects and driven up prices, as well as soaring material costs, limited land availability and onerous regulations. About 900,000 single-family houses are expected to be built this year, well below demand for 1. 3 million, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The higher costs are prompting builders to put up fewer starter homes and more expensive units to maintain profit margins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home buying gridlock</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, existing homeowners, particularly&nbsp;Generation Xers, would like to move to bigger homes but fear not finding one or having to shell out much more for it,&nbsp;especially with average 30-year fixed mortgage rates at 4. 4%, up from less than 4% last year, Melendez says. &nbsp;And after the sharp price run-up since 2012, many homeowners worry any new house&nbsp;they buy could lose value. Fifty-three percent of homeowners surveyed by ValueInsured in February think they could see another housing crash, up from 37% in early 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many Baby Boomers, meanwhile, are delaying retirement and staying in their current homes longer as well, McLaughlin says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compounding the logjam is the tax overhaul. It caps the mortgage interest deduction at home values up to $750,000, down from $1 million, for homes bought after Dec. 15, discouraging some high-end buyers from moving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bottom line: Many existing homeowners are staying put, further limiting the supply of starter homes and pushing up their prices. Buyers of starter homes devoted an average 41. 2% of their income to housing costs in the first quarter, up from 37% a year ago, <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> says. That’s well above the 30% most experts recommend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home buyers are girding for a battle. About a quarter are willing to offer more than asking price and 40% plan to put down more than 20% when they make a purchase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's kind of like a race," Maneva says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sellers are eager to get the highest price they can - but they might not always know what features will attract a premium.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That’s why Zillow crunched the data on 4 million home sales during the last two years to figure out what convinces buyers to pony up. The top amenity? Steam showers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Properties with listings that mentioned these enclosed showers - which can be used as steam rooms - sold for 29% above their expected value, after considering the size and age of the home, their analysis found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other wellness-related features also scored high, with Zillow finding that homes with heated floors and free-standing tubs also sold for more money than expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The top 10 features with their premiums are:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steam shower (29%)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Professional-grade appliance (29%)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pizza oven (26 %)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pet shower (25%)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outdoor kitchen (25%)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Entertainer or prep sink (25%)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shed or garage studio (24%)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Heated floors (24%)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meditation room (24%)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wine fridge (22%)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homebuyers are responding to these features because they signal properties that are likely to be updated and livable, Zillow home design expert Kerrie Kelly said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kitchen amenities like farmhouse sinks are still draws, but homebuyers are increasingly focused on outdoor spaces and health benefits - including pet showers, Kelly said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These small tubs with handheld showerheads are now popping up in mudrooms, because homeowners want to wash off Fido before he leaves muddy footprints in the living room.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Emphasizing wellness</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wellness amenities don’t need to break the bank, Kelly said. One of the top-scoring features is a meditation room, which can be repurposed from an existing bedroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“A mediation room is a low-hanging fruit,” she said. “It’s about painting walls and moving furniture. ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outdoor entertaining</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners increasingly want to entertain outdoors, which is why outdoor kitchens and pizza ovens are gaining in popularity, Kelly said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outdoor kitchens and fireplaces speak to the “interactions we all crave,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kelly recommends adding sliding doors or French doors to help extend a home’s interior space to its backyard or patio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Simple fixes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, she added, don’t despair if you don’t have the bucks to spend on a home renovation. Putting some elbow grease into freshening up your home also pays dividends, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There are some things, like adding new hardware or repainting rooms, that also help with capturing those dollars and having a home sell faster,” Kelly said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Below are an additional 10 amenities that help home sell for more than expected, according to Zillow:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chef’s kitchen (21%)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Craftsman style (21%)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Herringbone or parquet floors (21%)</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. sales of existing homes rebounded in February after declining for the previous two months, a sign that many Americans are still looking to buy despite rising prices and a shrinking number of homes available. The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Wednesday that sales rose 3% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.54 million.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">The big question for Fed officials: Three rate hikes or four this year?</span>
</div><div class="author">Paul Davidson </div><div>433 words</div><div>19 March 2018</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>B.4</div><div>ISSN:07347456</div><div>English</div><div>© 2018 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three or four? Markets will be transfixed on that question this week as <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> policymakers either maintain their forecast for three interest rate hikes this year or bump it to four. Economists are divided on which way Fed officials will go.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed also is expected to raise its key rate by a quarter percentage point, but that's packing less suspense since it's expected. Also on tap: reports on home sales and business investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's little doubt the Fed will lift its benchmark interest rate to a range of 1.5% to 1.75% at a two-day meeting that ends Wednesday. Analysts say there's a 95% chance the Fed will act, according to <span class="companylink">CME Group</span>. It would be the central bank's sixth rate hike since late 2015. Several Fed policymakers have hinted they may boost their forecast for 2018 from three hikes to four amid a low 4.1% unemployment rate, a surging global economy and federal tax cuts and spending increases that will further juice the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nomura economist Lewis Alexander believes policymakers' median forecast will rise to four, but <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> predicts it will stay at three while the projection for 2019 shifts to four hikes from three. The meeting will also be the first for Jerome Powell as new Fed chairman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales fell in both December and January. Although solid job and income growth have fueled demand, housing supply shortages have crimped purchases. Economists expect the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> to report a modest 0.9% increase in existing home sales last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.43 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home sales are similarly caught between conflicting forces. The sturdy labor market and strong consumer confidence support demand but rising home prices and mortgage rates have discouraged buyers, Alexander says. Builders also face shortages of construction workers and lots. After two months of declines, economists expect Commerce on Friday to announce that new home sales rose 4.6% in February to an annual rate of 620,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commerce will publish its monthly tally of business orders for durable goods such as computers and factory equipment. Orders for capital goods excluding aircraft and defense -- a proxy for business investment -- edged down in December and January. But business fundamentals are healthy amid a resurgent global economy and oil industry. Economists expect a rebound in February with the key measure of capital goods orders rising a robust 0.8%.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Consumer Price Index report: Did inflation climb higher or ease in February?</span>
</div><div class="author">Paul Davidson </div><div>499 words</div><div>12 March 2018</div><div>USA Today Online</div><div>USATONL</div><div>n/a</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2018 USA Today Online. Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All rights reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report on inflation takes center stage in this week’s economics news, with investors eager to see if a sharp jump in January that stoked fears of higher interest rates continued in February. Also on tap: the latest data on retail sales, housing starts and industrial production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, the Labor Department releases its closely-watched consumer price index. Consumer prices climbed a hefty 0. 5% in January and a core measure that excludes volatile food and energy items rose 0. 3%, the most in a year. The news fanned concerns that the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates this year more than the three times it has forecast. The January jobs report already had stirred inflation worries and spooked markets by featuring the largest increase in average hourly wages since 2009. But the February employment report on Friday showed pay increases moderating and the fresh inflation data could follow suit. While rent probably increased moderately, airline fares likely dipped, says Nomura economist Lewis Alexander. Economists estimate that overall and core inflation both rose 0. 2%, nudging total annual inflation to 2. 2% from 2. 1% and keeping the core reading steady at 1. 8%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More: As steel companies celebrate, trade war talk worries makers of cars, planes and whiskey</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retail sales helped power consumer spending and the economy in 2017 but sales were flat in December and fell 0. 3% in January, the largest decline in nearly a year. Economists don’t expect the slump to persist. The recently passed tax cuts, which began showing up in workers’ paychecks last month, likely boosted spending, Alexander says. And job and income growth have remained sturdy. Auto sales slowed in February amid rising interest rates, Alexander notes, but other sectors have performed well. Economists expect the Commerce Department on Wednesday to record a solid 0. 2% rise in retail sales and a 0. 4% increase in a core measure that excludes volatile categories such as autos and gasoline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, Commerce announces last month’s housing start totals. &nbsp;Starts leaped 9. 7% in January but that followed a weather-related decline in December. Housing demand is strong and supplies are low, a combination that’s expected to lift&nbsp;home construction. But the growth in starts has been tempered by construction worker shortages, rising material costs and limited lot availability. So after January’s strong gain, economists are forecasting a 3. 1% drop in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1. 29 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industrial production has enjoyed a resurgence rooted in a strong global economy and a rebound in oil drilling activity. While the warm weather likely damped utility output last month, factory and oil production probably picked up. After production dipped 0. 1% in January, economists are looking for the Fed to report a solid 0. 3% rise in February.</p>

</div><div class="author">Ken Fisher </div><div>777 words</div><div>4 March 2018</div><div>USA Today Online</div><div>USATONL</div><div>n/a</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2018 USA Today Online. Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All rights reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home must be where the heart is, because my Feb. 19 column&nbsp;on homeownership being a lousy investment annoyed readers mightily. I may as well have spit on motherhood, apple pie and the girl next door. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But my basic point remains true. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Readers’ biggest gripe: What about rent? Overwhelmingly, folks believe owning is cheaper than renting. And they believe that buying, via mortgage payments, transfers “wasted” rent into an investment. Wrong and mostly wrong. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, almost none of your monthly mortgage payments apply to equity for many years. In my column, I used an example of owning a home in San Mateo County, Calif. , from 1995 to 2005 because it was among America’s best-performing regions. But in those 10 years, only 16% of your payments would have morphed into equity. Most of that money would have slid down a rat hole, like rent does - only different because of its slight interest deductibility under today’s tax rules. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second, while many readers don’t seem to want to believe it, renting a comparable house is almost always cheaper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">U. S. Census Bureau</span> reports national and local costs for renting and owning homes&nbsp;at www. census. gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045217. Nationwide, from 2012 to 2016, the average median monthly gross rent was $949. That’s rent plus utilities and fuels. Comparable homeownership via mortgage plus taxes and other costs&nbsp;was $1,491.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In every state, as well, owning costs more than comparable renting. With the San Mateo location, the median spread was $3,102 vs. $1,830. In Cincinnati, it was $1,239 vs. $662. In Houston, $1,492 vs. $898. &nbsp;And Atlanta: $1,744 vs. $998 - 43% cheaper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That said, I erred in my earlier column, understating the return of owning a home in San Mateo County in two ways. In haste, I pulled data from a wrong column using 15 years of mortgage payments instead of 10. This understated returns by 1. 5% a year. I also erred in calculating the interest balance and the total mortgage payment amounts becoming equity over the decade involved. This understated returns by an additional 6. 2% a year. USA TODAY has run a correction. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, perfect timing in a perfect top-of-the-nation location generated 10. 8% annual returns (pre-tax), comparable to a 401(k)’s tax-deferred return over the same period with bonds at 8. 2%, or U. S. stocks at 11%. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But most regions fared far worse than San Mateo. Booming Seattle’s median home price jumped 102% that decade, from $134,975 to $272,925. But after including all costs, owners gained only 2% annually, far worse than most “investments. ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Austin’s median annual returns that decade, calculated the same way, were -13. 1%. Cleveland’s was even worse. A Cleveland resident in&nbsp;2005 selling a home at the cycle’s peak would have lost it all - a cumulative 134% loss. A Cleveland renter who took the savings from cheaper rent and invested them in stocks through a 401(k) would have accumulated more than $45,000. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another common reader gripe: Renters won’t invest any possible savings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you’re smart you will. But if you won’t, that still doesn’t make homeownership a great investment. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others groused a decade was too short. But I picked 10 years because that’s how long the average homeowner&nbsp;holds onto his or her&nbsp;property, according to the National Association of Realtors. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Theoretically, housing shouldn’t appreciate unless household population growth exceeds housing starts, or inflation occurs. But since 1960, America’s average annual housing starts exceeded&nbsp;population-based household growth by more than 400,000 - 1. 4 million vs. 970,000. Inflation drove most home price gains.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing weakness? Pending home sales drop</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing recovery appears to be making a U-turn as mortgage rates rise amid a critically low supply of homes for sale. Pending home sales, which measure signed contracts, fell 4.7% in January compared with December, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. It is the lowest point in nearly four years. The weakness was nationwide, and December's reading was also revised lower. Pending sales, an indicator of future closings, were 3.8% lower than January 2017.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer spending and confidence surged last year, but recent stock market volatility may have taken some toll early in 2018. Reports on those key measures highlight a busy week of economic news.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home sales plunged 9.3% in December as limited inventories and sharply rising prices curbed buyer interest. Housing permit increases suggest a rebound in January is likely, says Nomura economist Lewis Alexander. But he warns that low supplies and rising interest rates may continue to crimp sales. Economists estimate the Commerce Department on Monday will report a 4% increase in new home sales to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 650,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer confidence reached a 17-year high in November and has hovered modestly below that level in recent months. Strong job and income growth underpin Americans' positive outlook. But the market sell-off early this month may have dinged confidence. Still, Alexander says he believes the recent tax cut more than offset any market jitters. Economists figure the <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span> on Tuesday will announce a modest increase in its consumer confidence index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, Commerce releases its second estimate of fourth-quarter economic growth. Its initial reading showed the economy growing at a solid 2.6% at an annual rate late last year. And Commerce on Thursday provides its first snapshot of consumer spending in 2018.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two culprits underlying recent stock market volatility have been a spike in wage growth and expectations that the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> may raise interest rates more rapidly than anticipated this year as those pay increases spur stronger inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week's release of minutes from the Fed's Jan. 30-31 meeting could shed more light on Fed policymakers' outlook. Also on tap is the latest reading of existing home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The statement Fed officials released after their late-January meeting was largely interpreted by economists as somewhat "hawkish," meaning it reflected the view that the economy has strengthened and more rate hikes may be warranted. The statement described job growth, household spending and business investment all as "solid," an upgrade from the previous appraisal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While noting that annual inflation remains below its 2% target, the Fed said inflation "is expected to move up this year." It also said it expects "further gradual increases" in its benchmark short-term interest rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed policymakers have forecast three rate increases this year, but Barclays Chief U.S. Economist Michael Gapen said the addition of the word "further opens the door to four hikes and likely closes the door on two."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Gapen's assessment was widely shared among economists, the meeting summary, out Wednesday, could clarify policymakers' thinking. The account, however, won't weigh in on the recent market turmoil, which began two days after the meeting. The gathering was the last for Fed Chair Janet Yellen. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell took the helm early this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales trended higher last year, marking their best performance since 2006, but they were volatile and fell 3.6% in December. Low housing inventories have curtailed choices and pushed up prices, making units less affordable, especially for middle-income buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cold weather in early January also likely chilled sales, Nomura economist Lewis Alexander says.</p>

Steven Cohen's new investment firm sued for sex discrimination against female employees</span>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- Billionaire investor Steven Cohen and his new financial company have been accused of creating a sexist work atmosphere that subjected female employees to humiliation and unfair pay practices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new lawsuit, filed Monday in federal court here, comes amid allegations of sexual discrimination and harassment of women by powerful men in many U. S. business and industry sectors. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lauren Bonner, an associate director at Cohen's <span class="companylink">Point72 Asset Management</span>, alleged that she and female coworkers suffered a pattern of improper conduct, including being forced to attend meetings in company President Douglas Haynes'&nbsp;office where a slang term for a vagina was allegedly written on a whiteboard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Point72's chief operating officer openly referred to women as "girls" and denied them access to events "because he says that 'no girls are allowed,'" the lawsuit alleged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Point72 denied the allegations and said it would "defend itself in a more appropriate venue than the media. "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bonner, who joined the company in August 2016, alleged&nbsp;that she was improperly denied promotions and was paid less than male coworkers with who fell short of&nbsp;her experience and qualifications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of those men was allowed to serve on the committee that decided whether Bonner would be promoted last fall, even though she had complained to the company that she had regularly endured his "insults and humiliation," the lawsuit charged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bonner's 2017 compensation target at the Connecticut-based company was base pay of $300,000, plus a $150,000 bonus, according to the lawsuit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with the court filing that names the company, Cohen,&nbsp;and Haynes, Bonner&nbsp;plans to file a discrimination charge against Point72 with the <span class="companylink">U. S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, the lawsuit said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This case is important precisely because it shows that, in 2018, wealthy, financially sophisticated, global companies such as Point72 continue to believe that they operate above the law," Bonner's lawsuit alleges. "As long as Point72 is allowed to do so, it will continue to abuse its female employees and operate in a manner allowing them to resort to dirty, illegal tactics to keep women from succeeding. "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a statement, Point72 said it has a strong record when it comes to women.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We stand by our record of hiring and developing women," the statement said. "In an industry where women are historically underrepresented, the hundreds of women at Point72 are vital members of every part of our organization. Our female investment professional workforce exceeds published industry averages -&nbsp;a direct result of our concerted and sustained focus on promoting diversity at Point72. "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long a highly successful investor, Cohen has an estimated&nbsp;net worth of $13 billion, according to Forbes magazine's ranking of the 400 richest Americans. He founded and previously managed <span class="companylink">SAC Capital</span>, an investment company he shut down as part of a record $1. 8 billion insider-trading settlement settled with federal prosecutors in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cohen was not charged personally, and he denied any wrongdoing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After being barred from managing money for outside clients until 2018, Cohen launched Point72 as a so-called home office that would manage his personal fortune and investments for the company's employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representatives for Cohen have held discussions with possible investors about potentially starting a new, multibillion-dollar hedge fund, The Wall Street Journal reported in 2016.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With fears of accelerating inflation sparking the stock market's free-fall over the past 10 days, this week's report on the consumer price index could get more attention than usual. But the reading is likely to be surprisingly tame. Economic news this week also brings the latest snapshots of retail sales, housing starts and industrial production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors panicked early this month when the January jobs report showed annual wage growth picking up to 2.9% from 2.5%. That triggered fears of stronger inflation and faster interest rate hikes by the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>. Overall monthly inflation probably did gain some steam in January as a result of rising gasoline prices, says <span class="companylink">PNC Financial Services Group</span>. But because of a relatively high reading a year ago, that likely pushed annual inflation down compared to the prior month. Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy items and which the Fed watches more closely, likely rose more modestly on a monthly basis as temporary factors such as a spike in rent faded, says Nomura economist Lewis Alexander. Economists estimate the Labor Department will announce Wednesday that the consumer price index (CPI) rose 2% annually in January, down from 2.1% the previous month while the core CPI increased 1.7%, down from 1.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retail sales have been booming in recent months as solid job and income growth lift consumer confidence. That narrative likely continued in January despite a cold weather spell early in the month. Economists predict the Commerce Department will report that retail sales rose a solid 0.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industrial production also has performed well, propelled by a resurgent global economy and U.S. oil industry. Economists expect the Fed to report Thursday that industrial production edged up 0.2% in January, down from a 0.9% increase the prior month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, Commerce reports on January housing starts. The cold weather early in the month likely curtailed new construction, PNC says. And with housing starts falling 8.2% in December -- the most in 13 months -- economists are looking for a modest rebound. They predict Commerce will announce a 2.8% increase in housing starts in January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.2million.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN FRANCISCO -&nbsp;Amazon laid off workers at its corporate campuses&nbsp;Monday, a rare event at&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the nation’s largest corporate employers, sources at the company said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The job eliminations are mostly concentrated in Amazon’s consumer retail business and involve several hundred employees in its Seattle offices along with hundreds of others elsewhere, a source&nbsp;within the company who was not authorized to speak publicly told USA TODAY.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a statement, Amazon&nbsp;said that as part of its&nbsp;annual planning process, it is making headcount adjustments across the company involving&nbsp;small reductions in a few areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That’s a tiny proportion of Amazon’s close to 300,000 U. S. -based employees&nbsp;but rare for a company&nbsp;that, unlike many, seldom undergoes large cuts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firings are part of a shifting talent allocation to businesses within arenas such as Amazon's&nbsp;Alexa service that are growing, sources said. Those laid off are encouraged to apply for other open positions at the company. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amazon is still furiously hiring on other fronts. It currently has 4,000 positions open in Seattle and 12,000 globally, all of which are corporate jobs and not in its warehouses or fulfillment centers. In the past five months, Amazon has announced the leasing of at least 1&nbsp;million more square feet of office space in Seattle, which is estimated to host another 5,000 staffers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Globally, Amazon has 566,000 employees. While&nbsp;it was unclear how many of those were in the United States,&nbsp;estimates put the number at close to 300,000, including the 90,000 <span class="companylink">Whole Foods Markets</span> employees who joined last year when Amazon purchased the company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has&nbsp;also said it would hire 50,000 more at its second headquarters, which it is currently scouting a home for.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That makes it one of the largest U. S. corporate employers. For contrast, <span class="companylink">Walmart</span> has more than 1. 5 million employees in the United States.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harvey Weinstein can't escape being a media or legal target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Sunday, New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman filed suit against <span class="companylink">The Weinstein Company</span>, Harvey Weinstein&nbsp;and Robert Weinstein for egregious violations of New York’s civil rights, human rights&nbsp;and business laws.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Filed in&nbsp;New York County Supreme Court, the suit includes new and extensive accusations about longtime company CEO Harvey Weinstein’s&nbsp;mistreatment of employees. Employee&nbsp;accounts of sexual harassment, intimidation&nbsp;and other misconduct are part of the suit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The suit delays the sale of <span class="companylink">The Weinstein Company</span>, which was expected to close Sunday, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Schneiderman's office expressed&nbsp;concerns&nbsp;that those responsible for any misconduct would receive a windfall. Any such sale "must ensure that victims will be compensated, employees will be protected going forward, and that neither perpetrators nor enablers will be unjustly enriched,” the attorney general said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lawsuit seeks restitution and damage payments for victims, as well as fines paid to the state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ben Brafman, Harvey Weinstein's attorney, responded to the suit in a statement to USA TODAY.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We believe that a fair investigation by Mr. Schneiderman will demonstrate that many of the allegations against Harvey Weinstein are without merit. While Mr. Weinstein's behavior was not without fault, there certainly was no criminality, and at the end of the inquiry it will be clear that Harvey Weinstein promoted more women to key executive positions than any other industry leader and there was zero discrimination at either Miramax or TWC," the statement reads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If the purpose of the inquiry is to encourage reform throughout the film industry, Mr. Weinstein will embrace the investigation. If the purpose however is to scapegoat Mr. Weinstein, he will vigorously defend himself. "&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among notable examples&nbsp;of harassment cited by the lawsuit:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Harvey Weinstein told several employees words to the effect of “I will kill you,” “I will kill your family,” and “You don’t know what I can do. " He also asserted that he had contacts within the Secret Service who could take care of problems for him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MORE:&nbsp;LAPD sends 3 Harvey Weinstein cases to DA for possible criminal charges</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• <span class="companylink">The Weinstein Company</span>, the suit says, "employed one group of female employees whose primary job it was to accompany (Harvey)&nbsp; to events and to facilitate (his) sexual conquests. … One of the members of this entourage was flown from London to New York to teach" his assistants "how to dress and smell more attractive" to him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Another group of employees were assigned to "further his regular sexual activity, including by contacting . . . prospective sexual partners via text message or phone at his direction and maintaining space on his calendar for sexual activity. "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• A third set of employees&nbsp;also were forced to facilitate his sexual conquests. These female employees were supposed&nbsp;to help his company produce films and television projects. But despite their skills and stated job responsibilities, he required them to meet with prospective sexual conquests for his own personal interests. "This compelled service demeaned and humiliated them, contributing to the hostile work environment. ”&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RELATED:&nbsp;&nbsp;McGowan's ex-manager dies by suicide; family blames McGowan, Harvey Weinstein, media'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• His use of vulgarity was widely noted in the suit, which described how he would call&nbsp;female employees "c---" or "p----" when he was angry with them or felt they had done a task&nbsp;poorly or incorrectly. And he also used those terms to scold or degrade male employees. &nbsp; On some&nbsp;occasions, he asked female employees if they had their period, including asking an employee if her tampon was "up too&nbsp;far," the filing says. &nbsp;In one 2012 incident, he launched into a tirade against a female employee in which he berated her in front of other employees and threatened to&nbsp;"cut (her) loins. "&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">•&nbsp;Weinstein's assistants were required to&nbsp;provide&nbsp;childcare for&nbsp;his young children and handle other domestic work for his wife, Georgina Chapman, and an adult daughter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Assistants had copies of a document called the “Bible,” which included information about his likes and dislikes, and a list of people to assist arranging "personals," or sexual activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• His drivers in both New York and Los Angeles were required to have available condoms and erectile dysfunction injections in the car at all times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• The suit says the head of human resources at Weinstein's company&nbsp;was not empowered to do anything about his ongoing sexual harassment of female employees. Victims were told by the director of HR that he "sympathized" with them, acknowledging that they had a "tough job," but that there was nothing he could do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New York attorney general says that Robert Weinstein, who was aware of his brother's sexual misconduct,&nbsp;allowed Harvey to create a hostile work environment and engage in sexual misconduct, and did nothing to prevent it.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Worried residents say housing prices, gridlock would be unbearable</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN FRANCISCO - Landing <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s $5 billion new headquarters and its 50,000 tax-paying workers would be quite the coup. And possibly quite the headache.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials and civic organizers in some of the 20 cities now vying to win <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s choice for its second headquarters are sounding alarms that accommodating this tech talent invasion could put a big strain on local residents already grappling with crawling commutes and high housing prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Nashville, some residents were blunt about how a new <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> headquarters and its well-paid workers could drive up both the prices for rental units and homes alike, exacerbating housing problems. "We have a housing crisis now, and all this would do is throw gasoline on the fire," says John Summers, a former city council member who leads the Coalition for Nashville Neighborhoods. "We cannot build affordable housing to replace what's being lost by the rapid gentrification in all of our inner-city neighborhoods."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some don't even seem to mind if <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> picks another suitor. Just days after Denver made the finals, Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper told the City Club of Denver that if billionaire CEO Jeff Bezos didn't choose the Mile High City, "I'm not going to cry," according to The Denver Post.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Hickenlooper later clarified that he was excitedly pursuing the headquarters because he felt it was the right thing for the city and state, he allowed that some citizens would feel "a sense of relief if they choose somewhere else because there are a lot of challenges and lot of hard work we will be avoiding."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In sprucing up their <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> bids for Bezos, cities ranging from Atlanta to New York will need to take an honest look at whether housing stock and public transportation -- both critical to a winning bid -- are up to the HQ2 challenge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While cities such as Boston and New York are well-known for their efficient public transit systems, both suffer from aging infrastructure and struggle to keep up with existing demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boston has been trying to find a solution for its growing traffic problems in part by efforts to link its commuter rail lines, says Barry Bluestone, professor of public policy at Northeastern University. "Our town has the talent (to win the bid) but we have to find a way to move these new workers," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's a concern shared even by fans of the Washington, D.C., area's three finalist bidders. Richard Bedrick, a graduate student studying real estate development at the <span class="companylink">University of Maryland-College Park</span>, says that while he is excited D.C., northern Virginia and Montgomery County, Md., are all in the running, the traffic implications of a win make him pause.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"D.C. has enough (traffic) as it is," Bedrick says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those sentiments are echoed among some in finalists such as Miami, Raleigh, N.C., and Los Angeles, which already is notorious for its gridlock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business owner Mina Lee grew up in Montgomery County, home of wealthy D.C. suburbs such as Bethesda, and says she is "super excited" about the "great opportunity" of hosting HQ2. But at the same time she is concerned that a flood of new young workers and their families could cause overcrowding in schools.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are similar concerns in Nashville.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You're starting to see, I think, resistance and pushback to this continual grow, grow, grow, grow at any cost," Nashville neighborhoods advocate Summers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The poorest residents of these bidder cities are likely to feel the biggest impact of HQ2, as <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> employees boasting six-figure salaries accelerate neighborhood gentrification and price out existing residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People here are enthusiastic about the benefits (of <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s HQ2), but those economic benefits often miss our most vulnerable citizens," says Daniel Brisson, executive director of the Burnes Center on Poverty and Homelessness at the <span class="companylink">University of Denver</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some cities are already behind when it comes to housing stock. Bluestone has been helping to assemble the Greater Boston Housing Report Card for 15 years. The latest score notes that even without HQ2, "Boston needs a minimum of 160,000 more housing units by 2030, and we're not producing that at the required rate."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such statistics indicate that the winning city must brace for "two tales -- one about winners and one about losers," says Javier Vivas, director of economic research for Realtor.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These things push up home values based on increased demand, which is great for some folks, but it's not great news for existing residents hoping to get into the housing market who aren't on <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> salaries," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smaller, less developed markets such as Raleigh and Columbus, Ohio, are likely to better cope with 50,000 new tech workers than larger, housing-constrained cities such as Denver, Boston and New York, Vivas adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prospect of HQ2 coming to the City of Angels led resident Lisa Connolly to write a pointed letter of warning to the <span class="companylink">Los Angeles Times</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"<span class="companylink">Amazon</span>'s cannibalization of Seattle's real estate market would exacerbate an already unsustainable situation," she wrote. "If we want Los Angeles to become the next San Francisco, this is a surefire and irreversible way to accelerate the process."</p>

Steve Wynn accused of sexual misconduct, report says</span>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of <span class="companylink">Wynn Resorts</span> plunged 10% in Friday trading after The Wall Street Journal reported allegations that billionaire CEO and chairman Steve Wynn engaged in sexual misconduct with company employees over&nbsp;decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report quoted accounts in which dozens of people who worked at Wynn&nbsp;casinos&nbsp;said&nbsp;his behavior represented a&nbsp;pattern of sexual misconduct, including allegedly pressuring some employees to perform sex acts with him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a statement sent to the Journal and issued as a news release by the casino company, Wynn wrote&nbsp;that "the idea that I ever assaulted any woman is preposterous. "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We find ourselves in a world where people can make allegations, regardless of the truth, and a person is left with the choice of weathering insulting publicity or engaging in multi-year lawsuits," Wynn continued in the written&nbsp;statement. "It is deplorable for anyone to find themselves in this situation. "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wynn, who is to&nbsp;turn 76 on Saturday, is the latest in a series of high-profile men who have been accused of improperly using their power to pressure&nbsp;female employees and other women into sex. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lengthy Journal&nbsp;report cited&nbsp;one episode shortly after the flagship <span class="companylink">Wynn Las Vegas</span> opened in 2005. A&nbsp;manicurist who worked there was purportedly pressured by Wynne to disrobe and, eventually, to have sex, according to a colleague who said the worker sobbed as she described afterward what allegedly took place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Citing unidentified people familiar with the matter, the Journal reported that Wynn paid the manicurist a $7. 5 million settlement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the report, the alleged incident was referenced, in broad terms, in a lawsuit filed by Elaine Wynn, Wynn's ex-wife, against the casino mogul and the gaming company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is clear that Mr. Wynn's ex-wife has sought to use a negative public relations campaign to achieve what she has been unable to do in the courtroom: tarnish the reputation of Mr. Wynn in an attempt to pressure a revised divorce settlement from him," <span class="companylink">Wynn Resorts</span> said in a statement issued Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is noteworthy that although Ms. Wynn says she knew about the 2005 allegations involving Mr. Wynn in 2009, she never made them known to the board of directors, of which she was then a member, and she did not raise them until after Mr. Wynn remarried and the shareholders of <span class="companylink">Wynn Resorts</span> voted not to elect her to the board," the statement said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Beyond this incident, dozens of people The Wall Street Journal interviewed who have worked at Mr. Wynn’s casinos told of behavior that cumulatively would amount to a decades-long pattern of sexual misconduct by Mr. Wynn," the newspaper report said. "Some described him pressuring employees to perform sex acts. "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among other things, the report cited accounts from former employees who said they entered fake appointments in casino salon calendars to help female employees to avoid Wynn&nbsp;requests for services in his office suite.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others recounted incidents in which female employees hid&nbsp;in the bathroom or back rooms when they learned Wynn was on the way to the salon, the Journal reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More: #MeToo isn't just a hashtag, it's destigmatizing - and 'that's 'huge'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some say one false report could cripple the #MeToo movement. Is progress that fragile?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Wynn Resorts</span> investor Richard Miller, the managing partner of Gullane Capital Partners, recommended an outside investigation of what he characterized as the "darn serious allegations," Bloomberg News reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wynn, an internationally known casino executive, is listed with a current net worth of $3. 6 billion on the Forbes 400 list of the richest Americans. Along with <span class="companylink">Wynn Las Vegas</span>, Wynn created some of the most notable gaming and hotel landmarks in Las Vegas, including <span class="companylink">The Mirage</span>, Treasure Island, and Bellagio. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The son of an East Coast bingo parlor operator, he took over the struggling business when his father died and moved into&nbsp;the Las Vegas&nbsp;casino industry&nbsp;in 1967, the Forbes report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wynn Resorts' president is Matthew Maddox, who joined the company in 2002. Maddox also serves as a non-executive director of <span class="companylink">Wynn Macau</span>, a company subsidiary that operates a luxury casino and hotel in China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Steve Wynn has supported both Republican and Democratic campaigns over the years. However, he has become more involved in Republican politics as former casino rival Donald Trump rose to national political power and won the 2016 presidential election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wynn served as the vice chair &nbsp;- alongside fellow casino mogul and GOP booster Sheldon Adelson -&nbsp;for the committee that raised more than $107 million for Trump’s inauguration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shortly afterward, Wynn was named as the <span class="companylink">Republican National Committee</span>’s finance chairman. He has&nbsp;since worked on raising campaign financing for the 2018 midterm congressional elections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Republican National Committee</span>&nbsp;did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Journal report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The published allegations sent <span class="companylink">Wynn Resorts</span> shares 10. 1% lower to a $180. 29 close. &nbsp;Even with Friday's nosedive, the stock is up roughly&nbsp;87% from this time last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The steep drop&nbsp;sliced&nbsp;$2. 09&nbsp;billion from the company's market capitalization,&nbsp;according to market data from FactSet. &nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Wynn, whom&nbsp;the data shows as owning an 11. 8% stake in&nbsp;the company via&nbsp;12. 132 million shares, lost $246. 4&nbsp;million in stock value Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">The Vanguard Group</span>, a U. S. investment advisor giant, is the casino company's top institutional investor, with a&nbsp;nearly 8% stake, the data shows.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Economy grew solid 2.6% in Q4 but less than expected</span>
</div><div class="author">Paul Davidson </div><div>585 words</div><div>26 January 2018</div><div>USA Today Online</div><div>USATONL</div><div>n/a</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2018 USA Today Online. Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning. All rights reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy grew solidly for a third straight quarter late last year on strong consumer spending and business investment, but the performance fell short of analysts’ estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nation’s gross domestic product - the value of all goods and services produced in the U. S. - increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2. 6%, following advances of 3. 1% and 3. 2% the previous two quarters, the Commerce Department said Friday. Economists had expected 3% growth. &nbsp;It would have marked&nbsp;the first time the economy has grown by 3% or more for three straight quarters since the second half of 2004 and early 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy expanded at a 2. 3% rate for all of 2017 after a disappointing 1. 5% increase the prior year. That modestly exceeds the tepid 2. 2% average during the 8 ½ year-old recovery from the Great Recession of 2007-09.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps most encouraging is that the economy is showing&nbsp;resilience. Growth topped 3% in the third quarter despite brutal hurricanes in Texas and Florida. Rebuilding efforts in those areas were expected to bolster activity late last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Trump has promised 3% annual growth under the Republican tax cuts, but that may be a tougher challenge. The tax overhaul is expected to boost growth modestly in 2018, but the economy has started off recent years meekly, a trend that many economists attribute to measurement problems. That pattern could persist in the current quarter. And some analysts expect rising interest rates to temper activity late this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The economy is doing quite well,” says Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors. “The idea that we can get significantly above (2. 6% growth) is questionable. ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any president, of course, is just one of many forces affecting the economy. Strong global growth and a rebound in energy prices were already propelling the U. S. economy when Trump took office, though his agenda of cutting corporate taxes and regulations has boosted business confidence and stocks. At the same time, his moves to restrict&nbsp;trade and immigration ultimately could hurt growth, economists have said. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the fourth quarter, consumer spending increased&nbsp;a healthy 3. 8%, up from 2. 2% in the third quarter. Consumers are benefiting from sturdy job and income growth and record stock prices, and the holiday sales season was the best in 12 years. &nbsp;The tax cuts could further stoke consumption this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business investment rose&nbsp;6. 8%, its fourth straight solid showing. Businesses have stepped up their outlays because of a revival in oil drilling and a resurgent global economy. Equipment outlays jumped 11. 4% as companies struggling to find workers amid a 4. 1% unemployment rate purchased more labor-saving technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential investment, largely housing starts, surged 11. 5% after two months of declines. Builders are putting up more single-family homes in response to a long-term housing shortage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government spending increased 3% on a robust 6% rise in defense outlays and solid increases in federal, as well as state and local spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But business stockpiling subtracted nearly seven-tenths of a percentage point from growth after adding to economic gains the previous quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while exports increased 6. 9%, imports leaped 13. 9%, partly because of the strong&nbsp;consumer purchases. That imbalance served as a drag on growth overall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This was the government's first estimate of economic growth in the fourth quarter. It will publish two more revised estimates in coming weeks.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The alienist will (finally) see you now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The long-gestating adaptation of Caleb Carr's 1994 novel The Alienist comes to life on TNT (Monday, 9 ET/PT, ( *** out of 4 stars), and it was worth the wait. Starring Daniel Brhl, Luke Evans and Dakota Fanning as a team of sleuths seeking a serial killer in 1896 New York, the series is a melancholic mystery with just enough melodrama to make it addictive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Alienist follows Dr. Laszlo Kreizler (Brhl), a quirky and curt early psychologist who forces himself into an investigation of the murder of a young male prostitute, which may be related to other killings. He dragoons his friend, illustrator John Moore (Evans, trading his Beauty and the Beast smarm for more of a sweet and bumbling ineptitude), into his hunt, and eventually Sara Howard (an all-grown-up Fanning), the police chief's secretary and the <span class="companylink">NYPD</span>'s first female employee. The team is filled out by investigative brothers Lucious and Marcus Isaacson (Matthew Shear and Douglas Smith).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a serial-killer series, Alienist doesn't bring much novelty to the genre. Laszlo, John and Sara pore over files and sketches of the graphic crimes and guess at the mind-set of the man who committed such heinous acts. The series' focus on the early adoption of practices such as fingerprinting and psychological profiling makes it vaguely reminiscent of <span class="companylink">Netflix</span>'s Mindhunter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the mystery it weaves is intriguingly lurid. The series revels in the macabre and grotesque as the camera dwells on the victims' bodies and the sordid New York underworld.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those unsavory images are what make Alienist stand out. The series can overwhelm with its intricately decorated sets and costumes. The production built its seedy, filthy version of Gilded Age New York with the care and detail a fantasy series might use for its castles and battlefields.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its success stems mostly from Brhl. The wicked energy that served him so well in films such as Captain America: Civil War bolsters his portrayal of Laszlo, a hero with darkness lurking just beneath his placid veneer. Although The Alienist's tone is somber, Brhl giddily rips into every scene.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Evans and Fanning impress in less flashy parts. Fanning's Sara takes on new relevance in today's climate as she is harassed and abused as the only female employee at the police station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's no shortage of serial-killer dramas, and if The Alienist feels familiar, it makes up for it by presenting its story in a striking package. And you won't want to look away.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy grew at better than a 3% annual pace in both the second and third quarters last year. Did it score a hat trick in the fourth quarter, taking another step toward President Trump's promise of 3% growth for a full year? Quite possibly, an economist says. The week's economic news also features reports on home sales and business investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales spiked in October and November on pent-up demand after hurricanes in Texas and Florida suppressed activity in September. But that rebound likely petered out in December, says Nomura economist Lewis Alexander. And home sales, he notes, remain constrained by supply shortages. Economists estimate the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> will report Wednesday that existing home sales fell 2.4% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.7 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a similar story for new home sales, which shot up 17.5% in November amid a rush of buyers who couldn't close deals after the hurricanes hit. Strong job and income growth should continue to propel the sale of newly- built homes. Economists expect the Commerce Department on Thursday to announce a 7.9% drop in new home sales for December to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 675,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy expanded at a 3.1% annual pace in the second quarter and 3.2% in the third quarter, mostly on robust consumer and business spending. Consumers have opened their wallets in response to solid job and income gains, record-high stock prices and cheap gasoline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the GOP tax cuts and Trump's sweeping rollback of business regulations have created expectations for stronger profits. The sturdy consumer and business spending was likely sustained in the fourth quarter while rebuilding efforts in the hurricane-stricken regions fueled a rebound in housing starts, Alexander says. All told, economists expect Commerce on Friday to announce that the economy grew at a 3% annual rate in the last three months of 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A more recent reading of business investment can be found in Commerce's report on orders and shipments of durable goods such as computers, cars and airplanes. Capital goods orders excluding aircraft and defense -- a proxy for business investment -- generally have increased solidly in recent months.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it comes to equal pay for equal work, a majority of women believe that in the age of #metoo, an appropriate <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> handle might be #notyet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new survey by Ellevest, a financial firm focused on women investors, found 83% of women believe men are often paid more than female colleagues for the same work -- and 61% of men agree.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, 48% of women think they have to work twice as hard as a man to take home half the pay, and just 42% believe their opportunities on the job are the same as male colleagues. That's compared to 58% of men who believe that the playing field is fair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, at a time when a national conversation is taking place about sexual harassment, Sallie Krawcheck, Ellevest's CEO, thinks society may be poised to focus on another disparity fracturing the workplace: unequal pay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The gender pay gap is alive and well," says Krawcheck, who co-founded Ellevest in 2014. But "I hope this is the beginning of a first step for companies to really open their eyes, women to work together and for us to work to close it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2015, women were on average paid 80 cents for every dollar earned by men, the non-profit <span class="companylink">Institute for Women's Policy Research</span> says. The numbers were worse for women of color, with black women earning 68% of what was paid to white men and Hispanic women's pay amounting to just 62% of their white male peers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But just as sexual misconduct allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein triggered an examination of such behavior and led to the downfall of prominent media figures, high-profile cases are now turning a spotlight on the gender wage gap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This month, <span class="companylink">USA TODAY</span> reported actress Michelle Williams was paid less than $1,000 of the $1.5 million paid to co-star Mark Wahlberg for reshoots of the film All the Money in the World. Following a fierce backlash, Wahlberg said on Saturday that he would be donating his fee, in Williams' name, to the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the country fitfully moves toward paying women on par with their male peers, Krawcheck says that in the meantime, women need to be investing what they can. Currently, they are leaving hundreds of thousands of dollars on the table because they aren't investing at the same rate as male counterparts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I say, if you had a hole in your pocketbook, and a hundred bucks fell out, how many days would it take you to fix your pocketbook?" Krawcheck says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And being in command of their money significantly lifts women's self esteem, with 63% saying building savings and investments that can fund their goals means more than their education or even the support of their family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the wage gap, "I am actually more hopeful than I have been in a long time about us closing it," Krawcheck says. "Money may not buy happiness, but money is power. It is key to peace of mind. It is key to levels of comfort, and in this day and age, it's key to saying, 'Quit chasing me around the desk. Take this job and shove it.'"</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A light week of economic news will provide a snapshot of two resurgent forces of the U.S. economy -- manufacturing and housing construction. Both probably ended 2017 on a solid note, supplying some momentum for this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industrial production has been propelled by a steadily improving global economy, a dollar that generally has weakened since early 2017, making American goods less expensive overseas, and a revival in oil drilling. In December, automaking probably rebounded from a drop the previous month while other sectors continue to climb, Nomura economist Lewis Alexander says. He says oil and natural gas production showed no sign of slowing, and frigid weather probably boosted utility output sharply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, economists estimate the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> will report Wednesday that industrial production rose a healthy 0.4% in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An index that gauges the outlook of home builders can often provide a preview of housing construction in the months ahead. The market improved last year as solid job and income growth drove demand while home supplies remained skimpy, pushing prices higher. The crunch spurred builders to churn out more houses. In December, an index of prospective buyer traffic jumped eight points, underscoring continued strong buyer interest despite the rising prices, Alexander says. On the downside, the cold weather may have temporarily chilled homebuying plans this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alexander estimates the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> will announce that its index of builder sentiment ticked up from 74 to 75, which would mark a 19-year high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though housing starts have been ramping higher, they've presented a tale of two markets. Single-family starts have been bolstered by the supply shortage and more recently by rebuilding efforts in parts of Texas and Florida battered by hurricanes late last summer. Multifamily building has declined after a blitz of apartment construction the past few years. Economists project the Commerce Department will announce Thursday that housing starts dipped 2.1% in December to a still-solid seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.27 million.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DETROIT -- The 2019&nbsp;Ram 1500 promises many things -&nbsp;to be lighter, quieter, more fuel-efficient and simply better than its predecessor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new flagship of <span class="companylink">Fiat Chrysler</span>'s&nbsp;Ram brand certainly makes a statement, both with what's new and with what's gone. Say hello to a new&nbsp;chiseled- and more aggressive-looking Ram logo and goodbye to grille cross hairs. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ram 1500&nbsp;is&nbsp;one of the most highly anticipated vehicle unveilings - set for Monday morning - at Detroit's North American International Auto Show. It will compete, as it always has, against Ford's F-150 and <span class="companylink">General Motors</span>' Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The truck takes a "no-compromise approach to the full-size truck segment," said Mike Manley, who heads the Ram brand for <span class="companylink">Fiat Chrysler Automobiles</span> in a statement, making it an increasingly important piece of the automaker's portfolio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Ram 1500 loses 225 pounds, can tow 12,750 pounds of towing capability and has a jumbo 12-inch touchscreen display. Buyers get a choice of two engines: a second-generation 3. 6-liter Pentastar V-6 or a 5. 7-liter Hemi V-8.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To reduce weiight and&nbsp;boost fuel efficiency, the new Ram includes strategic use of aluminum, including for the tailgate, which can be dropped using an interior switch or remotely with the key fob or passive entry. It also includes lift assist helped by a nitrogen- and oil-charged strut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several features - an active front air dam that deploys at 35 miles per hour,&nbsp;grille shutters that close when air flow isn't needed and an optional suspension system that can lower the truck&nbsp;give it a 9% aerodynamic improvement&nbsp;over the 2018 model. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new truck offers 12 color choices&nbsp;and 15 new wheels; the center stack is higher and closer to the driver; the center console has&nbsp;five USB ports; the upper glove box can act as a shelf;&nbsp;and, to ease storage, inside, there's a flat-load floor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A three-position sliding cup holder tray can be stowed under the center armrest to reveal a deep storage tub designed to hold a 15-inch laptop. Lifting the lid of the center armrest also reveals an additional lined storage compartment sized to fit a tablet and/or hang a full-size file. At the rear of the console, there are two additional cup holders, which include a tablet holder for rear passengers," according to the company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Being a modern truck, it's also packed with lots of&nbsp;standard and optional safety features, such as adaptive cruise control, adaptive front lighting, blind-spot monitoring and forward collision warning.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More: Ford, Chevy and Ram unveil new pickups: Why America loves them</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Fiat Chrysler</span> hopes the new 1500, which is being built in the Detroit area,&nbsp;will help the company continue its pickup truck&nbsp;sales momentum as it competes against the likes of the Chevrolet Silverado and Ford F-150. Including the 2500 and 3500, more than 500,000 Ram pickups were sold in 2017. Pickup truck sales have been profit drivers for the automakers as they deal with a weaker, but still strong sales market after historic highs in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michelle Krebs, senior analyst for AutoTrader. com, said truck sales are doing well because of strong economics boosted by construction activity such as housing starts. She predicted the new Ram's sales should be strong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer continue to have a positive image of the current Ram, even as it has become more dated. “That bodes well for the launch of the new model, (which)&nbsp;is being launched from a strong position. Further, it launches in a market that is hot for trucks, a trend we expect to continue this year," Krebs said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dave Sullivan, an analyst with AutoPacific, said 2018 should be a big year for the Ram brand, and the new truck has plenty to offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Ram has improved upon every aspect of their truck with a well-appointed interior, amazing rear seat comfort and an optional infotainment system unlike any other truck you can buy. I think Ram has a big hit on their hands," Sullivan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pricing and fuel economy ratings have&nbsp;not yet been released. The new Ram will be on sale in the first quarter of the year.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Trump's secretive real estate sales hit $35M</span>
</div><div class="author">Nick Penzenstadler </div><div>1011 words</div><div>11 January 2018</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>A.1</div><div>ISSN:07347456</div><div>English</div><div>© 2018 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Trump's companies sold more than $35 million in real estate in 2017, mostly to secretive shell companies that obscure buyers' identities, continuing a dramatic shift in his customers' behavior that began during the election, a <span class="companylink">USA TODAY</span> review found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Las Vegas, Trump sold 41 luxury condo units in 2017, a majority of which used limited liability companies -- corporate entities that allow people to purchase property without revealing all of the owners' names.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend toward Trump's real estate buyers obscuring their identities began around the time he won the Republican nomination, midway through 2016, according to <span class="companylink">USA TODAY</span>'s analysis of every domestic real estate sale by one of his companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the two years before the nomination, 4% of Trump buyers utilized used the tactic. In the year after, the rate skyrocketed to about 70%. <span class="companylink">USA TODAY</span>'s tracking of sales shows the trend held firm through Trump's first year in office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Profits from sales of those properties flow through a trust run by Trump's sons. The president is the sole beneficiary of the trust, and he can withdraw cash at any time. The opaque sales come as Congress and ethics watchdogs have called on Trump to be more transparent about his domestic and foreign customers and partners, including the buyers of his companies' real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least one of the sales in 2017 was to a German couple. His company determined that transaction does not qualify as a "foreign deal," which the president and his lawyers vowed to avoid while he is in office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trump appointed an independent ethics adviser, attorney Bobby Burchfield, to review new deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, when <span class="companylink">USA TODAY</span> first reported the rapid rise in the share of obscured buyers among Trump's real estate transactions, Burchfield would not reveal the details of his reviews. Now, he says a four-part test is used when evaluating a deal: Is it at fair market value or in the ordinary course of business? Is it an appropriate counterparty? Is there any indication the deal is intended to curry favor with the president? And is there any likelihood the deal could compromise or diminish the office of the president?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If someone wants to do business with the Trump entities in the form of an LLC, we look behind the LLC to see who the owner of it is and where the funding is coming from," Burchfield told <span class="companylink">USA TODAY</span>. "If we can't determine that, we won't sign off on it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those deep-dive identifications and financial disclosures are difficult and easily spoofed, said Ross Delston, a Washington attorney specializing in anti-money-laundering compliance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said Burchfield's test is largely subjective. "From what we know of the <span class="companylink">Trump Organization</span>'s past real estate deals is they never see deals they don't like," Delston said. "Having an ethics adviser shut down a deal based on a test not mandated by law strikes me as somewhere between unlikely to unthinkable."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company's internal ethics reviews are not subject to public scrutiny.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Burchfield wouldn't say whether he declined to sign off on any Trump real estate deals in 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New buyers last year ranged from real estate investment funds, wealthy individuals seeking an investment and vacation property to some that were unreachable by reporters -- largely because of the secrecy associated with their shell companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ramsis Ghaly, a neurosurgeon near Chicago purchased a condo in Trump's Vegas property in late December, using an LLC. He said he used the LLC to protect his identity and on the advice of a financial consultant. "Was I nervous my name could be associated with him? Sure, you're always concerned with the politics and media, but for me, the positives of the property outweighed the negatives," Ghaly said. "A lot of my doctor friends buy in Trump Chicago -- I was a little hesitant, but I believe in the guy, and it wasn't about politics."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A single condo in Trump's Vegas development sold in October for $1.6 million. That stretched the price per square foot to about $1,000, pushing the limits of the market, said Nicole Tomlinson, a high-rise sales specialist at <span class="companylink">Shapiro &amp; Sher Group</span> in Las Vegas. "You pay a premium for a high floor, view and penthouse, but that's high for condos and Las Vegas overall," Tomlinson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Efforts to reach Lorraine Tan, the name listed on the deed for the 63rd floor penthouse were unsuccessful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jason Feldman, a real estate investor in Florida, purchased a Trump condo in Las Vegas in December, using an LLC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Feldman said he is a member at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Fla. He said politics didn't factor in his decision to buy the Vegas condo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Trump family involvement in the Vegas project played zero role in the purchase decision at all," Feldman wrote in an email. "The deal was purely an economic decision. In my opinion I think these are underpriced given the growth of the Las Vegas market and likely will buy more units."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4114 TIH LLC purchased a condo in Las Vegas in November. The company was formed days before the purchase in Nevada by Georgia Attorney Robert Goldberg and his son Hayden of Las Vegas. Robert Goldberg said he plans to live in the unit part-time and use it for rental income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'll let the public record speak for itself on the sale, I'm not anybody. Using an LLC is standard procedure," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It wasn't standard procedure for Trump buyers before his presidential campaign, when fewer than one in 20 of Trump companies' real estate buyers were LLCs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trump and billionaire partner Phil Ruffin own about 350 units in the tower. Ruffin's staff indicated that the pair wouldn't own fewer than 300. Maintaining that many units protects their options for a casino license someday under Nevada law.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The labor market ended 2017 on a disappointing note, adding 148,000 jobs in December, well below the 190,000 expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> partly blamed the lackluster performance on&nbsp;snowy weather in the eastern U. S. , while other economists said the low unemployment rate was&nbsp;making&nbsp;it harder for employers to find workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But not every industry was&nbsp;a dud. &nbsp;Some punched above their weight. Here’s a rundown:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weak performers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Retail. Lost 20,000 jobs as shoppers continued to shift online from physical&nbsp;stores. Still, that’s more than the average 5,600 jobs a month that retail shed in 2017. The snowstorms may have hit retailers harder as many Americans who might have ventured out, opted instead to do their holiday shopping online. Many chains, including department stores, also are closing outlets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More: Employers added disappointing 148K jobs in Dec.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More: <span class="companylink">Macy's</span> announces more store closures: see the list</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More: Hot housing market could cool in 2018</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Professional and business services. This is a big category that includes lawyers, accountants, architects, engineers and many information-technology workers. Many months, the sector is the job-growth leader, but it added just 19,000 last month, less than half its monthly average of 44,000 last year. Computer design firms fared well enough, adding 3,300 jobs, but accounting and bookkeeping firms lost 15,400.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Financial and real estate firms. Added 6,000 jobs, below their monthly average of 11,000 in 2017. Insurance carriers added a solid 2,000 jobs but banks trimmed 1,100.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Solid performers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Construction. Contractors added 30,000 jobs, above their solid monthly average of 17,500 last year. The total may have been bolstered by a pickup in rebuilding projects in parts of Texas and Florida hit by hurricanes in late summer. Also, housing starts accelerated in 2017 as builders responded to skimpy home supplies that have driven up prices. Construction could get a further boost from the Republican tax cuts, which are expected to spur more business investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Manufacturing. Added 25,000 jobs, more than its healthy monthly average of 16,300 in 2017. Manufacturers are benefiting from a surging global economy and a resuscitated oil industry. Solid job growth in construction and manufacturing is welcome because each of those sectors lost about 2 million jobs in the Great Recession and they supply the kinds of middle-income positions that have dwindled in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Leisure and hospitality. Added 29,000 jobs, more than its monthly average of 25,500 despite the inclement weather. Restaurants and bars have been a jobs growth engine and didn’t disappoint last month as they added 25,000 jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• Health care. Has been a steady performer for years, partly because of the Affordable Care Act and an aging population. Health care added 31,000 jobs last month, up from 2017's&nbsp;&nbsp;monthly average of 25,000.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Will the U.S. economy bust out in 2018?</span>
</div><div class="author">Paul Davidson </div><div>984 words</div><div>3 January 2018</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>B.1</div><div>ISSN:07347456</div><div>English</div><div>© 2018 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. economy in 2018 may finally unload some of the baggage that has slowed it down since the Great Recession ended in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already, economists say, the recovery is beginning to expand to more industries and sweep up more of the Americans left on the sidelines over the past 81/2 years. Those trends will likely gather force this year, analysts say, while tepid wage gains accelerate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Republican tax-cut plan, recently signed into law by President Trump, could provide a further modest boost, economists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think growth is shifting into a higher gear," says Mark Vitner, senior economist at Wells Fargo. "It looks like we're finally putting the financial crisis behind us."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy isn't expected to register the breakout 3% growth Trump has promised, at least in the near term. But it is forecast to grow 2.6% in 2018 as consumer spending keeps chugging and business investment ratchets higher, according to the average estimate of 52 economists surveyed by Wolters Kluwer Blue Chip Economic Indicators in early December. That would soundly beat 2017's projected 2.3% pace and the modest 2.1% average during the recovery and notch the second-best annual showing in that period behind 2015's 2.9% gain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(The survey was conducted before tax-cut legislation was passed by Congress, so the median forecast could be revised higher, based on updates by Vitner and other economists.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's more, the headline growth figure doesn't tell the whole story. The nation's manufacturing recovery largely has been driven by the oil production rebound, technology advances and pent-up consumer demand for vehicles, Vitner says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, he says, the pickup began spreading to other sectors as both the U.S. and global economy gained strength, including construction equipment, factory machinery and agricultural accessories. That, he says, will help provide jobs or more hours to underemployed factory workers in the Midwest and Deep South. "My general sense is we're going to see economic growth broadening," Vitner says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industrial production is expected to increase 2.5% in 2018, up from a 1.8% rise in 2017, according to the <span class="companylink">Wolters Kluwer</span> survey. A bump in housing starts and sales will add still more kindling to the mix, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And a 4.1% unemployment rate that's projected to edge down further will make it even tougher for employers to find workers, forcing them to more seriously consider Americans marginalized by a lack of skills or opioid addiction, says Diane Swonk, head of DS Economics. That group includes prime age men hit hard when manufacturing and construction each lost about 2 million jobs in the recession. Swonk says some companies are waiving drug tests for job applicants and providing treatment programs to addicted workers to reduce employee turnover. Others are bringing on workers who lack all the skills they're seeking and training them to fill in the gaps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, employers' struggles to find workers will continue to crimp hiring, experts say. Both Vitner and Swonk expect average monthly job growth to fall to about 160,000 in 2018 from 174,000 in 2017. Yet that's well more than the 100,000 or so needed to continue lowering the unemployment rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the tightening labor market will likely force businesses to increase pay more substantially to attract and keep workers. Average annual wage growth of about 2.5% should climb past 3% by the end of the year, the economists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fatter paychecks will be needed to continue advances in consumer spending. In 2017, workers coping with modest raises dipped into their savings to fuel their purchases, but Vitner says that lasts for only so long. He expects the tax cuts to spark more purchases, offsetting a pullback in auto buying. And Swonk says the record-high stock market should continue to make Americans feel wealthier and spend more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All told, the 52 economists surveyed by <span class="companylink">Wolters Kluwer</span> expect consumer spending to increase 2.5% in 2018, roughly in line with last year, amid healthy job and income growth. Consumer spending makes up about 70% of the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economists predict business investment will grow 4.7%, a touch higher than 2017, though Vitner and Swonk say it easily could top 6%. Capital spending began to rev up in 2017 as companies frustrated by the dearth of qualified job applicants bought more labor-saving equipment. Such purchases could bolster sluggish increases in productivity, or worker output, allowing the economy to grow even faster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A further jolt to business investment could come from the newly-passed corporate tax cut, Vitner says. He expects the legislation to increase economic growth by three-tenths of a percentage point in 2018. Swonk, however, predicts a slight lift of just a tenth of a percentage point. Some leading companies have said they plan to use their tax savings to buy back stock or increase dividends rather than for investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vitner and Swonk still expect the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>'s preferred measure of inflation to end 2018 a tad below its 2% annual target. And so they expect the Fed to stick to its tentative plan of three modest interest rate hikes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government will chip in. Increased spending on defense and aid for victims of 2017's hurricanes and wildfires, among other things, should add a half-percentage point to growth in 2018, says Lewis Alexander, chief U.S. economist of Nomura.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax cuts and additional spending will likely swell the deficit and eventually push up interest rates, Swonk predicts, posing a drag on economic growth in a couple of years. "I don't buy that," Vitner says. Like Trump administration officials, Vitner believes the tax overhaul could generate enough growth and government income to pay for itself.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tax changes, rising costs could discourage buyers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For several years, home sellers have had the upper hand as they haggled with buyers over price. In 2018, it might at least be more of a fair fight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nation's hot housing market could cool off next year as rising costs and tax-law changes discourage some buyers even as more homeowners put their homes up for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shift in bargaining power won't be dramatic. Many sizzling housing markets on the West and East Coasts will continue to see solidly rising prices, economists say. Yet the pace of the run-up will likely slow as a market that has long favored sellers evens out somewhat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Existing home sales will probably not make gains in 2018 even as the economy creates more jobs," says Lawrence Yun, chief economist of the National Association of Realtors. If his forecast bears out, it would mark the first year of flat or falling home sales since the housing crash 11 years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales are projected to be unchanged at about 5.6 million after rising 6.3%, 3.8% and 2.7%, respectively, each of the past three years ending in 2017, Yun says. The median home price, he predicts, will edge up about 2% to $253,000 after averaging 6% jumps since 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DEMAND COULD COOL</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many cities, buyers haven't been in the driver's seat since the launch of the home price recovery in 2012. And there hasn't been much relief for house hunters recently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In November, existing home sales hit an 11-year high despite just a 3.4-month supply of homes on the market, the lowest since 1999. The skimpy inventory has driven up the median home value by 48% since 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Healthy job and income growth has fueled demand for houses, including from more Millennial first-time buyers. At the same time, many Baby Boomers are staying in their homes instead of selling and flocking to retirement havens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors -- who buy houses to rent out or flip for a profit rather than to occupy -- also have held onto their property, reaping lucrative rents and sharp price gains, says Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist of real estate research firm Trulia. And new home construction has been curtailed by shortages of workers and available lots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the tide may be turning. The climbing prices, combined with stagnant wages, are making purchases less feasible for many prospective buyers, Yun says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And after falling this year, 30-year mortgage rates should increase from 3.9% to near 5% by the end of 2018, Yun predicts, as the Republican tax-cut plan sparks a stronger economy and mounting concerns about the federal deficit. All that could curb home buying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the lofty prices should finally coax more prospective sellers to pull the trigger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Homeowners may be thinking prices are going to peak," McLaughlin says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, despite shortages of workers and lots, home builders are expected to ramp up construction to meet steady demand. Housing starts are projected to rise 2.2% next year to 1.3 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result? More houses could come on the market even as buyers pull back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TAX-CHANGE IMPACT</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there's the tax-cut package. The package signed into law by President Trump last week will cap the deduction for property and state and local income taxes at $10,000. That could particularly affect a state such as New Jersey, which has the USA's highest property taxes, a high state income tax and expensive homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the margins, the prospect of a bigger tax bill may discourage some buyers and prompt some homeowners to sell and move to lower-tax states, says Nick Boniakowski, managing broker for Redfin in New Jersey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That could moderate sharp price increases in hot markets with easy access to New York City and pose a further drag on values in less desirable areas of the state, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already, he says, some buyers have canceled contracts in the hope of finding a better deal later in '18.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax bill also caps the mortgage interest deduction at home values up to $750,000, down from $1 million, for homes bought after Dec. 15.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The change will likely deter some high-end home purchases, particularly in California, Yun says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NO LET-UP IN PRICE GAINS?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neal Conatser, a Redfin broker in the San Francisco area, says the mortgage interest limit will more likely lead some prospective sellers to stay in their houses to hold onto their tax savings, further crimping supplies and pushing up prices in an already tight market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, Mark Fleming, chief economist at First American Financial, thinks the inventory crunch will worsen across the U.S. next year. Many homeowners, he says, are inclined to stay in place for fear of not finding another house in a competitive market or don't want to take out a new, higher-rate mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, he forsees surging demand from Millennial first-time buyers as more enter their early 30s and realize bigger income gains. The homeownership rate for households headed by people under 35 increased to 35.3% in the second quarter from 34.1% a year earlier, according to Trulia and Census Bureau figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the conflicting views, there are some signs that the market overall may cool. A recent <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> survey shows that for the first time in four years, buyer optimism has waned: Just as many Americans think next year will be worse than the current year for buying a house as those who think it will be better. And nearly one in three said 2018 would be a better year to sell a home vs. 14% who said it would be worse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're seeing waning interest in buying a home and greater interest in selling one," McLaughlin says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices and consumer confidence have been heading in just one direction - way up - and they don’t seem to be drifting back to earth as 2017 draws to a close. A light, holiday-shortened week of economic news also includes a report on pending home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> Case-Shiller national home price index rose 6. 2% annually in September, the most since June 2014, after the measure surpassed its 2006 peak earlier this year. Strong job growth and aging Millennials are driving demand. Supplies, meanwhile, remain skimpy amid a construction worker shortage that's curtailing new building and Baby Boomers who are staying in houses instead of moving to retirement havens. “Most economic indicators suggest that home prices can see further gains,” David M. Blitzer, managing director of the index committee at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, said last month. Some economists expect the price gains to moderate, but possibly not until mid-2018. Nomura economist Lewis Alexander predicts S&amp;P on Tuesday will report another solid annual price increase in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, the Conference Board announces the December reading of its closely watched consumer confidence index. The measure hit a 17-year high in November, riding strong job and income growth, still-affordable gasoline and record stock prices. Alexander says the sturdy labor market - which features a low 4. 1% unemployment rate that has given job-seekers more leverage - will lead to just a marginal dip in the index this month. The reading can signal future consumer spending, which makes up about 70% of economic activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending home sales are a good way to get a sneak preview of existing home sales. Pending sales represent contract signings while the existing sales reports reflect closings. Pending sales jumped a robust 3. 5% in October because of pent-up demand in the South after three months of hurricane-related declines. Sure enough, a report this&nbsp;week showed existing home sales increased sharply in November. &nbsp; Alexander, however, says the South is due for a return to normal levels, and so it would not be surprising if the National Association of Realtors reports a drop in pending sales last month.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales hit their highest mark in 11 years last month, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. Sales of existing homes sold at an annual seasonally adjusted pace of 5.81 million. That rate was last surpassed in December 2006 when homes were purchased at an annual rate of 6.42 million. The current inventory of homes for sale is only enough for 3.4 months, the smallest amount since the Realtors association began monitoring the market.</p>
