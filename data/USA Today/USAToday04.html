<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the stock market's next move and the Federal Reserve's next step are both data-driven, fresh readings on fourth-quarter 2013 GDP, pending home sales last month and initial jobless claims out today are must-see data points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sure, a wintry mix of ice, snow and subzero temperatures kept economic activity quiet, but stock investors and the nation's central bank will be watching closely to see whether there was any thaw in the data in February or in more recent weeks. So what's the market looking for?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The third and final revision of economic growth, in the final three months of 2013, is expected to come in around 2.7%, <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> says, a nice jump from the disappointing second revision of 2.4%, which missed expectations and was far below the first estimate of 3.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors are also expecting a slight tick up in the number of people lining up for unemployment benefits for the first time. Wall Street is expecting 325,000 people to file for jobless claims for the week ending March 21, up 5,000 from the prior week. The good news? The key four-week moving average, which has fallen three straight weeks, is expected to decline again to 321,000, down from 327,000 last week, <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, because of lousy weather and a dip in mortgage applications, February pending home sales are expected to edge up 0.1%, in line with January, <span class="companylink">UBS</span> says. Investors will be looking for any signs of spring thaw.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home sales rose sharply in January, defying expectations for a drop-off due to harsh winter weather in much of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales reached their highest level in more than five years, and were up 9.6% from December, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 468,000, the Commerce Department said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">December sales were revised upward to an annual rate of 427,000 from 414,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The figures were the best news in months for the housing market. Its recovery from the recession-era bust has lost some momentum due to sharp gains in home prices early in 2013, increased mortgage rates last year and a rough winter blamed for affecting both home buyers and builders in parts of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest reports on existing home sales, pending home sales, housing starts and home builder confidence were weaker, which is why various economists' forecasts for new home sales anticipated a drop in the January rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But economists reacted cautiously to Wednesday's report because new home sales figures can be volatile. January's numbers could be revised downward in coming months, as October's and November's previously reported figures were this month, said Richard Moody, chief economist of <span class="companylink">Regions Financial Corp</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Diane Swonk, chief economist of Mesirow Financial, observed that new home sales are a small portion of the overall housing market, and they remain very weak for a late-stage economic recovery. "We will need to see a lot more volume in construction to have a meaningful impact on employment, especially for low-skilled workers who had seen their wages boosted a bit from the rise in construction employment during the housing market boom," she said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two-thirds of Americans rate themselves as above-average drivers, according to a survey by Allstate, which accounts for the frequency of cars fished out of culverts, fish ponds and living rooms across the nation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A similar percentage probably consider themselves above-average investors, which accounts for the number of sectors that experience short-term 10% to 20% declines, even during a rip-roaring bull market. Everyone thinks he can get out of the way of the next wreck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For those who hold themselves to be opportunistic investors, those declines can be fine buying opportunities -- which brings us to real estate funds, a sector that investors drove into the bushes last year. Although the funds have recovered, they still represent decent value, and a good place to add money this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the more remarkable facets of last year's 29.6% gain in the <span class="companylink">Standard and Poor's</span> 500-stock index is how many fund categories took at least a 5% haircut over any given three-month period in 2013. Funds that invest in gold-mining stocks, for example, slammed into a 34% drop the three months ended June 2013. Commodity funds careened into a 11% decline during the same three months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate funds slid 8.5% the three months ended August 2013, and international real estate funds skidded 10%. All told, the MSCI U.S. Real Estate Investment Trust index fell 18.7% from May through August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What caused the real estate wreck? Real estate funds invest primarily in real estate investment trusts, or REITs -- which, in turn, invest in commercial real estate, such as apartment buildings, office buildings, shopping malls and even storage units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By law, REITs must pay out at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders in dividends. As a result, REIT yields tend to be higher than most ordinary stock dividends and higher than most 10- year Treasury yields.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, the average equity REIT yielded 3.65%, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts</span>. The 10- year T-note closed January at 2.67%, making REIT yields look like Ferraris in contrast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what caused REITs to back up so much in 2013? Had you asked the average investor where interest rates were going in early 2013, most would have said, "Up." And rising rates can be tough for REITs. When rates rise, mortgage costs go up, making it more difficult to purchase new buildings, and more expensive to hold them. Furthermore, rising rates make REIT dividends look less attractive than other investments -- such as 10-year Treasury notes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The conviction that rates had nowhere to go but up was what caused the REIT wreck, says Robert Gadsden, manager of Alpine Realty Income &amp; Growth, an institutional fund that has beaten 95% of its peers the past five years, according to Morningstar. It was terrified investors selling REITs, not fundamentals, that caused the downturn, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REITs have soared about 7% so far this year, vs. a loss of 0.5% for the S&amp;P 500. The reason? People have realized that interest rates have one other direction to go, which is down. The 10-year T- note yield has fallen from 3.03% Dec. 31 to 2.75% now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REITs are also tied to the economy, and especially employment. As employment rises, demand for office space and other commercial real estate rises. "In the absence of new supply, that benefits existing real estate," Gadsden says. "There are a lot of local markets and types of real estate where landlords can push higher on rental rates."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently, REITs are neither cheap nor dear. REIT yields are normally about 1.1 percentage points above the 10-year Treasury yield. As of Thursday, they were about 1.2 percentage points higher than the 10-year T-note, Gadsden says. "Valuations aren't rich on that level," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REITs are reasonable on another measure, says Jim O'Donnell, chief investment officer of the Forward funds. Analysts typically look at REIT prices vs. their funds from operations, or FFO. About 18 times FFO is cheap, and 22 times FFO is getting expensive. "We're in the middle of that range," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hotel REITs are on the cheaper end of the spectrum, Gadsden says. And so are many office buildings. Not surprisingly, the best earnings are from areas that are seeing job growth: San Francisco, Seattle, New York City. "Where there's job growth, there's pressure on supply, and people want to be there," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another round of rate anxiety could hit REITs. But O'Donnell says rate shock is usually "abrupt and front-loaded," meaning that REITs behave reasonably well in a rising rate environment -- after the initial smack, that is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if rates rise gradually as the economy improves, REITs could see total returns above 10% this year, says Gadsden. "To me, that's a good thing to have in a portfolio as a diversifier," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many investors, REITs provide a decent dividend cushion in the event of a downturn. And, because the real estate cycle is somewhat different from the stock cycle, they provide an extra bit of diversification. But REITs are still stocks, and when the stock market falls, you can expect your REIT to fall, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As always, you're better diversified if you buy through a low- cost fund. The less you pay to fund management, the more of your REIT return you keep. While REITs won't keep you from getting bumps in your portfolio, they can help you avoid going completely over a cliff.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tight inventory, higher prices and bad weather could add up to fewer-than-expected sales of existing homes in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> is slated to release sales figures for January today, and Wall Street is expecting sales to dip to an annualized rate of 4.75 million, down from 4.87 million in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has been on a steady path to recovery since its peak and eventual crash precipitated by the 2008 financial crisis. When the December sales figures were reported, the NAR noted that sales were crimped by a lack of inventory and resulting rising prices. In the final month of 2013, the number of homes for sale dipped to 1.86 million, down 9.3% from November. Similarly, in December 2013, the median price of an existing home soared to $198,000, a 10% jump from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year there were 5.09 million sales of existing homes, the best sales pace since 2006, according to the NAR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's a betting chance that sales will come in on the light side again in January, as the supply-demand and price dynamic likely remains intact. Add in the fact that most of the U.S. has been mired in one of the worst winters on record, and an upside surprise is unlikely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It may take until the spring to get an accurate assessment of the state of the housing market, given the severe weather conditions across many regions of the country," <span class="companylink">UBS</span> economist Maury Harris told clients.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales dropped 7% in December, setting off arguments about how much the cold weather held down sales and whether the report clouds the outlook for a recovery in home building this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders sold new single-family homes at seasonally adjusted annual rate of 414,000, down from 445,000 in November, the Census Bureau said Monday. The government also revised downward the annual sales rates for October and November by a combined 30,000 sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the full year, builders sold 428,000 homes, up 16% from last year but still the sixth-weakest year in records that date to 1963.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists split on how much of the drop was due to cold weather, pointing especially to the 12% drop in sales in the northeastern U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other factors that experts cited included the climb in mortgage rates, a shortage of credit for builders to construct more homes and slow household formation, which holds back new-home demand. But most forecasts continue to call for another solid gain in new-home sales in 2014, as the economy continues to work back to near-normal levels of activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm not very worried," said Patrick Newport, director of long- term forecasting at IHS Global Insight. "There's a high probability housing will be a major contributor to economic growth this year. We've been under-building for too long."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IHS predicts builders will sell 563,000 single-family homes in 2014, a 32% jump, Newport said. The firm thinks builders will start 1.16 million units overall, including for-sale condos and rental units, up from 923,400 in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weak sales data contradict other indicators that point to high confidence among home builders, especially an upward turn in building permits and housing starts, <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics economist Andres Carbacho-Burgos said. The <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> said that overall fourth-quarter sales were stronger than in the third quarter, and said pent-up demand and tight inventories should drive sales gains in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, household formation shows no sign of rebounding, and the national vacancy rate for houses is higher than normal after years of foreclosures, Trulia.com chief economist Jed Kolko said. "The funda-mentals still can't justify a return to normal construction levels."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Census Bureau said dips in northeastern states and the South outweighed increases in the Midwest and the West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales dropped at an annual rate of 12,000 homes in northeastern states and 18,000 in the South, the largest new-home market in the U.S. Sales rose by 9,000 units in the Midwest and declined by 10,000 in the western states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists had expected sales at an annual rate of 450,000, according to a survey by Econoday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales rose slightly in December, but the market lost momentum and inventories of homes for sale tightened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">December existing-home sales rose 1% from November to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.87 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Thursday. That was below expectations of 4.9 million. December sales were down 0.6% from a year ago, the NAR says. November's rate was also revised down to 4.82 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all of 2013, sales were 5.09 million, up 9% from 2012, the strongest showing since 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We lost some momentum toward the end of 2013 from disappointing job growth and limited inventory," says Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist. Still, he says the year ended at a pace close to normal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing inventories are still tight at a 4.6-month supply, the NAR said, down from a 5.1-month supply in November. Typically, Realtors consider a six-month supply to be a balanced market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventory typically falls in the winter, but December's was the lowest level in seven months, even with seasonal adjustments, says Jed Kolko, Trulia chief economist. "That's tough news for buyers hoping to have more homes to choose from this spring," Kolko says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Increasing home prices should bring out more sellers this year, but tight inventory will remain a "headwind," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales figures reflect sales of single-family homes as well as townhomes, condominiums and co-ops. Single-family home sales rose 1.9% in December from the month before but were also below last year's level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slowdown in momentum has been seen in previously hot markets, local market watchers say. Fewer investor buyers are part of the reason, says Mike Orr, Phoenix real estate expert at the W.P. Carey School of Business at <span class="companylink">Arizona State University</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given higher prices and interest rates, Orr expects a more subdued market this year, driven more by employment growth and young buyers vs. investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While currently "lackluster," U.S. home sales should improve in the coming months, says Robert Curran, managing director for <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>. Fitch expects existing home sales this year to hit 5.16 million.</p>

<div>1107 words</div><div>2 January 2014</div><div>USA Today (Newspaper)</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.5</div><div>English</div><div>© 2014 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.  </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing recovery hit high gear in 2013 with bigger than expected price gains and solid home sales. This year isn't likely to be as exciting. Rising mortgage interest rates will price out some potential buyers. Instead of double-digit price gains, look for single-digit ones, economists say, while existing home sales remain at last year's level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sound boring? "You want boring in the housing market," says Svenja Gudell, Zillow director of economic research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's what's ahead for:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices. They were the highlight of the 2013 housing market, up 12.5% in October year over year, <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> says. Prices are now 20% off their 2006 peaks after falling more than 30%, shows the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case-Shiller index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economist John Burns looks for a 6% gain in 2014. Many others see smaller increases ahead. Zillow forecasts just a 3% rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices will likely rise more slowly as more homes come on the market, fewer investors bid for homes and higher ownership costs -- including interest rates and home prices -- take a bite out of housing affordability, housing experts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, U.S. housing remains 4% undervalued when compared with other economic fundamentals, such as consumer incomes and the cost to rent, says Jed Kolko, <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> economist. At their 2006 peak, home prices were 39% overvalued based on the same metrics, Kolko says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales. They've started to slow. In November, they were down year over year for the first time in 29 months, National Association of Realtor data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dip was driven by higher interest rates and a tight supply of homes for sale. It doesn't mean the housing recovery has come off the rails, because home prices and housing starts continue to improve, says Capital Economics economist Paul Ashworth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales, which came in at a 4.9 million seasonally adjusted pace in November, are expected to be about 10% higher in 2013 than 2012 and stay about the same at 5.1 million in 2014, NAR forecasts. That's roughly back to 2007 levels but below the inflated levels preceding the crash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales. Sales of new homes, which make up a smaller part of the market, have more room to grow. They hit an annual pace of 464,000 in November, up almost 17% from a year ago but still below the 700,000-a-year pace generally considered healthy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new year will be different for home buyers, though.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Look for fewer bidding wars and a less frantic market, says Glenn Kelman, CEO of brokerage Redfin. Its data show bidding wars recently falling to one of two offers handled by Redfin agents, down from three of four at the peak in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes are taking longer to sell, and more sellers are also reducing prices to win sales, Kelman says. At the same time, the supply of existing homes for sale edged up to 5.1 months from 4.9 months in October, NAR says. That's still below the six-month supply that Realtors generally consider to be a balanced market for buyers and sellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supply should get closer to that level in 2014, Kelman says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Donaee and Jeff Reeve hope he's right. The couple sold their Seattle-area home in just 10 days amid a hot June market. They've been renting as they search for a new home with a few acres. Meanwhile, prices have risen. The lack of suitable homes for sale is "discouraging," says Donaee Reeve, 36, a dental hygienist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing construction. This part of the housing recovery has been a laggard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">November's data showed an improvement, with housing starts topping 1 million on an annual basis, the Commerce Department says. That was up almost 30% from a year earlier, but it's still far below the norm. Starts averaged 1.5 million a year before the mid-2000s housing boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction won't return to normal this year, but it will strengthen enough to be the main driver of the housing recovery as home price gains shrink, says investment manager Goldman Sachs Asset Management.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It sees housing starts increasing 20% a year for the next several years as household formation picks up with the strengthening economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More home construction means more jobs for construction workers, plumbers, civil engineers and others in the building trades, as well as related industries such as furniture manufacturing, it says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction alone will add 300,000 to 500,000 jobs a year to the nation's job base for the next three years, GSAM predicts. That's up from about 100,000 in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The construction revival is primarily a matter of when, not if," says Tom Teles, GSAM head of securitized and government investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates. Sarah and Andrew Katz know home prices are going up, and mortgage interest rates, too. But they're still convinced it's a good time to buy a first home. They've set their sights on spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're banking on interest rates staying under 5%, but they are what they are," says Sarah, 29, who works in public relations in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple better not wait too long, economists warn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average rates for a fixed 30-year mortgage will rise to 5.5% by the end of 2014, says Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist. Rates have already risen about 1 percentage point in the past year as the economy has strengthened. They'll be pushed up further as the Federal Reserve winds down its $85 billion monthly bond-buying program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each percentage point increase in mortgage rates makes homes about 10% more expensive in terms of higher housing payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another factor could weigh on borrowers. Starting in January, lenders must make home loans that meet new federal qualified mortgage standards or face greater liability from borrower lawsuits, should the loans go sour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least 5% of mortgages extended in 2013 wouldn't meet the new standard, Yun says. More than that will likely face additional scrutiny from lenders as they implement all parts of the new rule, says Brian Koss, executive vice president of lender Mortgage Network.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He says the higher rates and tighter rules will likely drive some home buyers out of the market or into lower-priced homes than they could have afforded last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People have gotten spoiled," Koss says. Higher rates and home prices will test the strength of the housing recovery in 2014, he says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Cooper Tire &amp; Rubber</span> is calling off its proposed $2.2billion sale to India's <span class="companylink">Apollo Tyres</span>, which would have created the world's seventh largest tire firm. The U.S.-based company said Monday that financing is no longer available, and it continues to claim, as it has for months, that Apollo breached the terms of the agreement. After Apollo sought a better price because of issues dealing with the union representing Cooper employees, Cooper accused the company of stalling labor negotiations. Cooper took its claim to a Delaware court, but the court ruled last month that Apollo did not breach its obligation to quickly reach a pact with the <span class="companylink">United Steelworkers</span> union.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signed contracts to buy homes stopped declining</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of Americans who signed contracts to buy existing homes in November was essentially unchanged from October, suggesting sales are stabilizing after several months of declines. The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Monday that its seasonally adjusted pending home sales index ticked up to 101.7 from 101.5 in October. The October figure was revised lower from an initial reading of 102.1. Higher mortgage rates and strong price gains the past two years have slowed sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> in $591 million deal with <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> says it has made a $591 million deal with <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> to settle obligations related to loans that went bad after the housing bubble burst.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Has the spike in long-term interest rates put new home buyers back on the sidelines?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A massive 25.4% jump in new home sales in October sent a message that the headwind caused by rising mortgage rates was transitory, following a few months of slower sales related to more costly borrowing terms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question now is if the 444,000 annualized sales rate in October was a sign that the housing market can power through higher rates, or if the jump to 4.51% from 4.32% for a conforming fixed- rate 30 year mortgage caused buyers to pause.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"November's new home sales figures will be a barometer of how well the housing recovery is doing in the face of higher mortgage rates," says the economics team at Capital Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median Wall Street estimate (half are higher and half are lower) for November new homes sales is 448,000, a 4,000 increase from the prior month. But Capital Economics expects sales to dip 0.9% to 440,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Capital Economics says it will be closely watching to see whether there were any "revisions" to October's massive percentage gain in sales, as large monthly changes are often revised lower in subsequent data releases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The crucial point," Capital Economics says, "will be whether any downward revision this time around will be large enough to change the impression that sales have come through the rise in mortgage rates relatively unscathed."</p>

<div>426 words</div><div>20 December 2013</div><div>USA Today (Newspaper)</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.1</div><div>English</div><div>© 2013 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales lost steam in November as buyers faced higher interest rates and a tight supply of homes for sale, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales dropped for the third straight month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.9 million, down 4.3% from October and down 1.2% from a year earlier -- marking the first year-over-year drop in 29 months. Home sales are being hurt by higher mortgage interest rates, limited inventory and tight credit, says Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slip in sales volume doesn't mean the housing recovery is "coming off the rails," however, says Paul Ashworth, chief economist for Capital Economics. That's because home prices are still rising at a rapid clip annually and new home construction is strengthening, with starts up 23% in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices are a more reliable gauge of market strength than home sales, says Patrick Newport, IHS Global Insight economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October, home prices were up 12.5% year over year but just 0.2% from September, <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> data show. Virtually no month-to- month growth is expected for November, <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">November's sales results are more evidence of a housing market returning more to normal after a historic housing bust and then rapid price bounce off the bottom, says Budge Huskey, Coldwell Banker CEO. He, too, expects moderating price gains going forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop in existing sales in November was most pronounced in the West, which also has seen the most robust price increases amid tight inventories. Sales there were down 8.5% from October and 10% from last year, NAR says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes are still selling quickly, however. For the U.S. overall, the median time on the market for a home sold last month was 56 days, down from 70 days a year earlier. Expanding inventory may lengthen that. Since a bottom in January, the supply of homes for sale is up 8.4%, on a seasonally adjusted basis, says Jed Kolko, <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR's report follows the Federal Reserve's announcement that it will trim its bond buying starting next month. The Fed's tapering, which was expected, probably will drive mortgage interest rates higher. That'll be "a tough reality check for many home buyers," says Ellen Haberle, economist for real estate brokerage Redfin. Many buyers have come to expect rates under 5%, she says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts rose almost 23% last month, touching their highest level in more than five years and further demonstrating the housing market's growing strength.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts hit a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.09 million -- topping October's revised estimate of 889,000 -- and rising about 30% from the year before, the Commerce Department reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">November's rate was the highest since February 2008 and marked only the second month in the past four years that the annual rate cracked the 1 million mark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family home starts reached their highest level since March 2008 at 727,000 -- still far below normal -- but up almost 21% above the revised October figure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits, which indicate future construction, were again above a million units in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big jump in starts was only for November, while September and October starts remained around lower summertime levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the November jump doesn't look like a one-month blip because both October and November permits, which lead starts by one or two months, were strong as well. That points to continued construction growth in December, says Jed Kolko, <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing construction numbers follow Tuesday's report of a strong bounce in U.S. home builder confidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo</span> builder sentiment index climbed to 58 in December. That matched an eight- year high reached in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts should pick up further next year as the industry gradually recovers, says the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It expects 825,000 starts next year for single family homes and 322,000 for multifamily homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's still far below what the NAHB considers a normal rate of about 1.3 million for single family and 324,000 for multifamily, says David Crowe, NAHB chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, higher mortgage rates are hitting the market. The average interest rate for a 30-year-fixed rate mortgage increased to 4.62% last week, the highest level since September, the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span> says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage applications for home purchases were down 6% from the week before and 12% from a year ago, MBA says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Mortgage applications fell further last week, with the market index falling to its lowest level in more than a dozen years," said Mike Fratantoni, MBA's Vice President of Research and Economics. "Both purchase and refinance applications fell as interest rates increased going into today's Federal Open Market Committee meeting."</p>

<div>478 words</div><div>10 December 2013</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.1</div><div>English</div><div>© 2013 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, opened up the possibility of a small reduction in the Fed's bond-buying program, another sign the central bank may soon shrink its 15-month-old monetary stimulus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking at the CFA Society of St. Louis on Monday, Bullard said an improving job market could let the Fed slow down its program of buying $85billion in long-term bonds every month. Employers have added more jobs than economists expected since the program was announced in September 2012, and the unemployment rate, now 7%, has fallen twice as fast as was then forecast, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The program stimulates the economy by keeping long-term interest rates low -- letting homeowners and businesses refinance debt and fund new purchases more cheaply. When Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke first said in May that the central bank might slow bond buying, mortgage rates rose more than a percentage point, curtailing momentum in home sales. The Fed decided in September not to "taper" immediately, a position that has softened after strong jobs reports for October and November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Based on labor market data alone, the probability of a reduction in the pace of asset purchases has increased," Bullard said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bullard's hints are consistent with other signs that the Fed is preparing to slow its purchases -- if not at its Dec. 17-18 meeting, then early in 2014. Several top officials have made similar speeches, and Monday's remarks are likely to be the last before the central bank's pre-meeting news blackout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Richmond Federal Reserve Bank</span> President Jeffrey Lacker and Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher also said they think the central bank will soon consider a taper. Unlike Bullard, neither has a vote this year on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When the FOMC meets next week, I expect discussion about the possibility of reducing the pace of asset purchases," Lacker said in a speech to the Charlotte Chamber of Commerce. "The key issue, in my view, is the extent to which the benefits of further monetary stimulus are likely to outweigh the costs." Lacker, along with congressional critics, has argued in the past that the Fed's purchases raised risks of inflation, although the consumer price index has gained just 1% the past 12 months, half the central bank's target 2% inflation rate. One reason the taper has continued has been Fed leaders' fear of inflation running too low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is no widely accepted reason why inflation is running as low as it is in the face of extraordinarily accommodative policy from the Fed," Bullard said. "Should inflation not (rise) toward target, the committee could pause tapering at subsequent meetings."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Businesses added 215,000 jobs in November, payroll processor ADP said Wednesday, fueling hopes that the government's closely watched employment report this week will continue a recent string of solid gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ADP survey, along with decent-to-strong reports on the broader economy and home sales, painted a portrait of an economy that's largely shrugging off the effects of the government shutdown and ongoing budget battles in Congress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase in private payrolls was the most in a year and soundly beat economists' consensus forecast that 165,000 jobs were added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists anticipate that the Labor Department on Friday will report about 180,000 employment gains in its survey, which tallies net additions among businesses as well as federal, state and local governments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two jobs reports broadly track similar trends, but ADP has had mixed success in forecasting the Labor tally. ADP, for instance, said businesses added 130,000 jobs in October, while Labor reported 212,000 and 204,000 gains overall, including government positions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In November, small businesses added 102,000 jobs; large companies, 65,000; and midsize ones, 48,000, ADP reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trade, transportation and utilities led job gains with 45,000. Professional and business services added 38,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction and manufacturing companies, two critical sources of middle-wage jobs, each added 18,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Employers across all industries and company sizes looked through the political battle in Washington. If anything, job growth appears to be picking up," said Mark Zandi, chief economist of <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics, which helps ADP compile the survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monthly job growth averaged a better-than-expected 202,000 from August through October, according to Labor's figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The labor market and the economy have proved resilient despite the 16-day government shutdown in October and the prospect of another budget standoff in Congress in the next six weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report on economic activity from early October to mid-November, the Federal Reserve said the shutdown dampened manufacturing and tourism in some areas, and many retailers had a tepid outlook for the holiday sales season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy expanded at a modest to moderate pace as housing and the auto and technology industries continued to support a pickup in activity, the Fed said in its "beige book."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Named for the color of its cover, the report, released every six weeks, provides an anecdotal snapshot of the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest edition could be pivotal because it will help the Fed decide whether to dial down its financial stimulus at its Dec. 17- 18 meeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economic activity expanded moderately in the New York, Atlanta, Cleveland, Richmond, St. Louis, Minneapolis and <span class="companylink">Dallas Fed</span> bank districts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Modest growth was reported in Philadelphia, Chicago, Kansas City and San Francisco, the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing recovery remains a bright spot. New home sales rose 25% in October, suggesting that the critical sector of the economy continues to strengthen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders sold homes at a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 444,000 in October after a revised estimate of 354,000 for September, the Census Bureau said Wednesday. That beat economists' projections of 425,000 for October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales are a crucial part of the recovery, because new home construction is still at less than half of its pre-recession peak, and each new home built supports between three and 4.5 new jobs, according to different estimates by economic consulting firms.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices rose by only 0.2% in October from September and virtually no growth is expected in November, market researcher <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, prices were up 12.5% in October vs. a year ago, marking the 20th consecutive monthly year-over-year increase nationally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"House price appreciation has slowed as expected for the winter," says Mark Fleming, <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Normal seasonal patterns and higher mortgage rates since spring explain why prices are no longer rising as rapidly as they did in the spring and summer, <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slowing pace also reflects a market showing "some level of normality," Fleming says, as investors, who have been buying up distressed homes for months, make up less of the overall activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Year over year, the five states with the highest home price appreciation were: Nevada, up 25.9%; California, up 22.4%; Georgia, 14.2%; Michigan, up 14.1%; and Arizona, up 14%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> report follows last week's release of the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case-Shiller 20-city index for September.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While 13 of 20 cities showed higher year-over-year growth rates than in August, 19 cities had lower monthly increases in September than August, Case-Shiller said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists expect home price appreciation to slow next year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices continued rising in September, but many cities posted smaller monthly gains, according to a closely watched barometer of the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 20-city <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller Index increased 0.7% in September from August and was 13.3% ahead of a year ago, <span class="companylink">S&amp;P</span> said Tuesday. Nineteen cities had lower monthly increases in September than August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report shows a housing market seemingly strong enough to tolerate small increases in mortgage rates, despite declining numbers of home sales in recent months, <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> economist Michael Gapen said. The outlook for prices is still solid heading into next year, as unemployment will dip below 7% of the workforce on its way to 6.5%, predicts Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a good sign for future sales and for new construction," said Naroff, arguing that higher prices will enable people whose mortgage balances have been higher than their homes' value until recently to sell their homes and trade up. "It will bring many more houses onto the market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Year-over-year comparisons show Las Vegas' prices were up 29.1% in September, the highest percentage. Other cities with gains above 20% included: San Francisco, 25.7%; Los Angeles, 21.8%; and San Diego, 20.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The double-digit price gains of the last year will moderate, just as month-to-month gains in median prices have slowed in data reported by the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>, Naroff said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another factor is that prices have been pushed higher by a shortage of homes on the market, and those gains will moderate as higher prices, still well below 2006 peaks, attract more sellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Vegas isn't going to go up 29% next year," Naroff said. "But I'm rooting for more price increases, because the natural churn and turnover doesn't happen until people have the confidence to list their homes."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That deceleration has begun to show up in some cities in Case- Shiller's data, as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September, Las Vegas home prices climbed 1.3% from August, less than half the 2.9% gain from July to August. In Tampa, a 1.1% gain in September followed a 2.7% month-to-month jump in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Overall, a price slowdown is healthy, and we're seeing evidence of a slowdown in the most overheated markets but no signs of an overall price crash," Trulia.com chief economist Jed Kolko said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another report released Tuesday said U.S. developers received approval last month to build apartments at the fastest pace in five years, a trend that could boost economic growth in the final three months of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Permits to build houses and apartments were approved at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.034 million, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. That's 6.2% higher than the September rate of 974,000 and the fastest since June 2008, just before the peak of the financial crisis. The gains were driven by a spike in apartment permits.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flattening sales will mark a sharp reversal from the past two years in which existing home sales increased from the year before. But the lack of income growth, higher home prices and rising interest rates will weigh on sales, says Lawrence Yun, the trade group's chief economist, speaking at the NAR annual conference here Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median home prices, currently about $200,000 for the U.S., will rise 6% next year after an 11% gain this year, Yun says. The existing home inventory is now near a 13-year low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The inventory shortage will not go away," Yun says, noting that new home construction is still far from historic levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While rising home prices will entice more people to sell homes, many of those people will also buy homes, Yun says. New home construction is what's needed to expand inventories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Markets with stronger job growth will do better next year than those without. Some of the best-performing housing markets next year will likely include Salt Lake City, Houston, Denver, Seattle, Tampa and Atlanta, Yun says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coastal California markets are likely to continue to experience inventory shortages given good job growth in many of those markets and little new home building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales could get a boost next year if lenders loosen lending standards. That would expand the pool of potential buyers. Lenders may do that given a drop-off in refinance demand. Refinance volume will fall next year to a 15-year low, Yun says. That's largely because interest rates have been below 6% for five years and there are not many people with mortgages left to refinance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the end of 2014, NAR forecasts the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate will hit 5.4%. Rates will rise as the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> pulls back on the stimulus measures it has used since 2008 to keep rates low and stimulate the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zillow's panel of 108 economists and real estate experts also predicts slowing home price appreciation ahead. They predict that home values will end 2013 up 6.7% over last year and rise 4.3% next year, eventually falling to 3.4% by 2018. At that pace, home values could exceed their May 2007 peak by the first quarter of 2018, Zillow's data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As home prices rise, more home sellers typically appear. In this market, there's been a "big disconnect" from that trend, says John Krainer, economic researcher at the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco</span>.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home prices were up 1.3% in August from July, but the peak rate of gain in home prices occurred in April, a widely watched index shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data through August show that prices were up 12.8% year over year, according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case-Shiller 20-city index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both the 10- and 20-city indices showed their highest annual increases since February 2006, and all 20 cities reported positive year-over-year returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while home prices continue to rise, it's at a slower pace each month since April. In August, 16 cities reported smaller gains compared with July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Las Vegas led the cities with a monthly increase of 2.9%, its highest since August 2004. It has seen ramped-up buying activity from investors now that more distressed inventory has become available to the market. Detroit and Los Angeles followed with monthly gains of 2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All 20 cities posted gains in August, but most showed deceleration compared with July. Seattle prices were up 0.5% in August. San Francisco has been losing momentum since April, when prices were up 4.9%, vs. 0.9% in August, Case-Shiller says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Las Vegas also led in the category of one-year gains, at 29.2%, followed by San Francisco at 25.4%. On the other end of the range was New York, with a one-year gain of just 3.6% followed by Cleveland at 3.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tight inventory conditions likely drove the strong year-over- year home price growth in many of the cities, says economist Ellen Haberle of brokerage Redfin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though more homes are for sale, the inventory hasn't expanded enough to bring home-price gains back down to near-normal levels, says <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> economist Jed Kolko. The for-sale inventory still looks about 15% below normal levels when adjusted for seasonal factors, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another reason home prices are still rising, although more slowly, is that buying is still 35% cheaper than renting in all of the 100 largest metropolitan regions, Kolko says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, sales are likely to drop off in September and October because of seasonal declines and "buyer anxiety" from the government shutdown, Haberle says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other home-price tracking services have shown slowing rates of appreciation amid higher interest rates, more homes for sale and slowing investor purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home values were up 1.2% in the third quarter from the second, Zillow data show. That's down from a 2.5% jump in the second quarter from the first.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Home value appreciation is better when it's boring," says Stan Humphries, Zillow economist. "It's good to see the pace of home value appreciation moderate, allowing the market to get back into a more sustainable balance and not topple over."</p>

</div><div class="author">Julie Schmit   </div><div>Julie Schmit, @JulieSchmit, USA TODAY</div>
<div>419 words</div><div>29 October 2013</div><div>USA Today (Newspaper)</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.1</div><div>English</div><div>© 2013 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big investors continue to expand into more cities for single- family homes as they pull back in others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, institutional investors, who largely buy single- family homes to turn into rentals, accounted for about one in four home sales in Atlanta, Las Vegas, St. Louis and Jacksonville, data from RealtyTrac show. They also accounted for a big chunk of sales in Charlotte and Memphis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price gains will likely follow the investor buyers, says John Burns, CEO of John Burns Real Estate Consulting, as they did in earlier hot investor markets such as Phoenix and Sacramento.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He speculates that investor buyers -- including institutional Wall Street buyers, individuals who flip homes for quick profits and mom-and-pop investors -- have driven much of this year's home price appreciation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> data show prices up 12.4% in August year over year but faster in areas favored by investors -- again, like Phoenix and Sacramento, which rose 18% and 26% respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Investors were just smart. They saw that homes were undervalued. They jumped in and pushed prices back up to normal," Burns says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big investors still account for a small part of the overall housing market. As a result, their effect on overall prices isn't that great, says Richard Smith, CEO of the real estate firm <span class="companylink">Realogy Holdings</span>, at a Zillow housing forum on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices also have risen in areas that have had little investor activity, says Mike Orr, real estate expert at the W.P. Carey School of Business at <span class="companylink">Arizona State University</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orr tracks the Phoenix market, which was one of the first targeted by investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In mid-2012, investor activity peaked in Phoenix, Orr says. Then, they accounted for almost 40% of home sales. Those investors would include small investors. For this September, Orr says, investors accounted for about 23% of sales. Historically, they would be 15% to 20% of the market, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though Phoenix home prices in August were up more than the national average, home price gains have been slowing this year, according to seasonally adjusted price data from <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case-Shiller index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A "cooling wave" in demand has now settled in after a frantic spring, Orr says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Falling investor interest is playing a role, but lack of enthusiasm from regular buyers is more important because they're more numerous, Orr says.</p>

<div>994 words</div><div>25 October 2013</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.1</div><div>English</div><div>© 2013 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the classic lines about real estate is that it will always rise in value because they aren't making any more of it. But it's not an argument that holds up for long. Real estate booms and busts have been part of the American financial landscape since the early 1800s, when a 50-acre farm was considered "cozy." They're not making asbestos insulation any more, either, and it's not getting one bit more valuable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market for residential real estate, however, has been fairly good. The S&amp;P Case/Shiller home price indices have gained about 12% in the past 12 months, buoyed by relatively low prices and mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But funds that invest in real estate stocks have been laggards, with the average fund rising just 7.5%, vs. 24.6% for the Standard and Poor's 500 with dividends reinvested. What gives? Quite a bit, starting with the fact that Wall Street expects interest rates to rise, pushing up mortgage rates and making real estate less affordable. But some real estate funds have done quite well this year, and they're worth looking into.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most real estate mutual funds don't invest in residential real estate. Instead, they invest in real estate investment trusts, or REITs, which buy and sell commercial properties -- hotels, apartments, office buildings, even storage units. By law, REITs have to pay out most of their taxable income as dividends, which means that they often have higher yields than Treasury securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How much higher? Currently, the 10-year Treasury note yields 2.52%, and the average money market mutual fund yields just 0.01%. The average equity REIT has a dividend yield of 3.68%, so it's no wonder they've been popular with income investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But REITs, like utility stocks and other income investments, tend to fall when investors think interest rates will rise. At the moment, you could unearth a hermit in the wilds of Borneo, and he would tell you, quite confidently, that interest rates are going to rise. Higher interest rates on an ultrasafe investment, such as a Treasury security, make other income investments less attractive. This belief, in turn, has hurt REIT shares. Whether it has hurt REITs enough to classify them as bargains remains to be seen. "Relative to the cost of financing, commercial real estate is still very cheap," says Scott Hastings, equity analyst for real estate securities at Delaware Investments. But, he concedes, it's not as cheap as it once was.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few real estate funds have stood out, however. One is Baron Real Estate (ticker: BREIX), which has gained 19.5% this year, according to Morningstar, which tracks the funds. When you outperform the pack by a large margin, you have to do something different, and in this case, the strategy has been simple: Avoid REITS. Manager Jeff Kolitch says the fund has just 13% of its assets in REITs, its lowest ever. "We've always pursued a broader, more diversified approach to real estate," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several of the fund's choices play on the surge in residential real estate: Lowe's, for example, should fare well as people fix up homes, either for resale or enjoyment. Another theme in the fund is the aging of the Baby Boom generation: It owns shares in Brookdale Senior Living and Capital Senior living. The fund even owns shares of <span class="companylink">SBA Communications</span>, which owns cellphone towers. "The company acts like a landlord, leasing out space to mobile carriers," Koltich says. "The whole world is going wireless, and it has more exciting growth than office space."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another standout real estate fund has been REMS Real Estate Value Opportunity (HLPPX), which is a more traditional fund that tends to hunt for undervalued stocks in the sector. "Real estate is generally fairly valued, but there are pockets of opportunity that we can take advantage of," says John Webster, president and director of research at REMS Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Webster thinks the residential real estate boom is still in the early innings, despite the potential for rising mortgage rates. And, he says, while the markets in coastal urban areas, such as New York, San Francisco, Boston and Washington, D.C., are fairly rich, institutional investors are turning toward Sunbelt markets, which offer better opportunities at lower prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate funds typically don't come cheap. REMS Real Estate Value Opportunity is a small fund with $25 million in assets, and it charges 1.75% in expenses each year. Baron Real Estate Retail, with $430 million in assets, charges 1.35% a year. For those who simply want pure exposure to real estate stocks, Vanguard REIT Index fund (VGSIX) has a 0.24% expense ratio. It's up 9.4% this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever you do, be extremely wary of non-traded REITs, which come with high upfront fees -- as much as 15% -- and have limited liquidity. "Investors think it's great, because it seems like they're getting a stable 6% return forever," says Hastings. But when they go to sell, they can find that the shares they thought were worth $10 are worth $7.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate can often be a good addition to your portfolio. It's not terribly well correlated to stocks, and can give reasonable amounts of income to cushion downturns. This is not a time, as in 2009 or 2010, when prices are in the cellar. But prices aren't goofy yet, either. If you do decide to invest in a real estate fund, do so gradually by adding a set amount each month to your fund. Set a limit on how much of your portfolio you want in real estate. You don't want to have all your money in REITs when the neighborhood goes to the dogs.</p>

</div><div class="author">Julie Schmit  </div><div>Julie Schmit, USA TODAY,</div>
<div>477 words</div><div>22 October 2013</div><div>USA Today (Newspaper)</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.5</div><div>English</div><div>© 2013 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales cooled in September because of higher interest rates, and the recent government shutdown may put a damper on activity for this month, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales dropped 1.9% in September to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.29 million from 5.39 million in August but were still up 10.7% from last year, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline was expected, given higher rates and rising home prices that pushed affordability to five-year lows, says Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The September figures reflect sales contracts signed in July and August when interest rates for 30-year fixed-rate loans were nearing their peak for the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rates have since fallen -- to about 4.3% as of last week for a fixed-rate 30-year mortgage, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales going forward may also face pressures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a per-capita basis, existing home sales are now back to historically normal levels, so there's not room for the increases the market saw earlier this year, says economist Paul Diggle with Capital Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher interest rates, higher home prices and relatively flat incomes will also conspire against buyers, Yun says. He expects existing home sales next year to be flat with this year after having risen for three straight years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent government shutdown also had a negative impact on consumer sentiment and added to economic uncertainty. That will cause home sales to "ebb" in the months ahead, says Stephanie Karol of IHS Global Insight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if sales flatten next year, prices will continue to rise, Yun says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One factor helping prices is fewer distressed homes on the market. Last month, distressed homes -- foreclosures and short sales -- accounted for 14% of September sales vs. 24% a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While all home sales were up 10.7% year over year, they were up 25% when distressed sales were excluded, says Jed Kolko, <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher prices should continue to bring more sellers onto the market, Kolko says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September, the supply of homes for sale stood at five months, NAR says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That means they would all sell in five months if no new supply was added. Realtors generally consider a six- to seven-month supply to be a balanced market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes still continue to sell fast, but not as fast as before. The median time on market was 50 days in September, up from 43 days in August but down from 70 days a year earlier, NAR says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national median existing-home price for all housing types was $199,200 in September, up 11.7% from a year ago. Median prices can vary depending on the type of home sold.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Middle-class home buyers are finding fewer homes on the market that they can afford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 14 of the top 100 metropolitan regions, more than half of the for-sale homes this month were out of reach for middle-class buyers, data from real estate tracker <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> show. A year ago, that was true in just eight of the leading metro areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising prices, higher interest rates, flat incomes and fewer foreclosed homes for sale are combining to limit choices for the middle class, says Jed Kolko, Trulia chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Trulia</span> considers homes affordable for middle-class buyers if their total monthly payment -- after a 20% down payment and including taxes and insurance -- is less than 31% of the median household income in their metro area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Affordability isn't as good as it was last year because home prices and interest rates are both higher. Home prices nationally were up 12.4% in August year-over-year, <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Trulia</span>'s study assumes a 4.5% fixed rate for a 30-year mortgage vs. 3.5% last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's more, there are fewer lower-priced homes for sale in many of the metros given the receding foreclosure crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August, 12% of existing home sales were distressed homes, down from 23% last year, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop-off in affordable homes for middle-class buyers is widespread, falling or flattening in 99 metros since last October. Only Rochester, N.Y., saw a slight gain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some cities are seeing faster declines than others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, only 23% of for-sale homes in Orange County, Calif. were affordable for middle-class buyers, <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>'s data show. That's down from 44% last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People have missed the boat," Orange County Realtor Cindee Cano says. She had one family recently relocate to Tennessee after they found that the three-bedroom condominiums they could afford a year ago in Orange County were no longer available in their price range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rather than shop for a two-bedroom condo, they bought a single family home in Tennessee, Cano says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>'s count, 11 of the 20 metros with the biggest drops in housing affordability for middle-class buyers have been in California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Significant changes also are occurring elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boston's middle-class buyers can afford 41% of the homes on the market in that metro area, down from 53% last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Denver, the share has fallen to 55% from 70% and in Seattle, to 55% from 66%, <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>'s data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the drops, overall housing affordability remains high by historical standards. Home prices are still 5% undervalued based on long-term price, income and rent levels, Kolko says. In 40 of the 100 metros this month, 70% or more of the homes were still within reach of middle-class buyers, <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>'s data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Middle-class buyers in higher cost areas must squeeze into smaller spaces to get affordable housing, <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>'s data confirm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median size of an affordable home for a middle-class buyer in the New York metro region was 978 square feet, <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> says. In San Francisco, it was 1,000.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home price gains are slowing after a strong bounce off the bottom, potentially marking a new phase for the housing recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home values aren't rising as fast as they were and even dipped in a few hot markets in September, according to Zillow. More homes are coming on the market, and Realtors report less competition among buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a market in flux," says Sherry Chris, CEO of Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate. "We are in year two of a long-term recovery, and there will be bumps."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home value gains are a key indicator of a market shift.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home values were up 1.2% in the third quarter from the second, Zillow data show, down from a 2.5% rise in the second quarter from the first.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September, values dipped about 1% from August in Los Angeles and San Diego, the first notable month-to-month drop in those markets since the recovery began, Zillow says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All told, half of 30 major metro areas covered by Zillow saw values fall in September from August, seasonally adjusted numbers show. Earlier this summer, all the same metros were seeing month-to- month gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More markets are likely to see declines this month, too, says Svenja Gudell, Zillow chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home values were flat or slightly up in September from August in Washington, D.C., Miami and Atlanta, Zillow's data show. But growth has slowed in the metros each month since July. In Atlanta, for instance, July values were up 3.1% from June. But September saw only a 0.7% bump from August, after being adjusted for seasonal factors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While down, it's still rapid appreciation. Historically, homes appreciated an average of 0.3% a month, says Jed Kolko, <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's not like prices are falling off a cliff. They're just slowing to a more sustainable pace," Guddell says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fewer investor buyers and more inventory are two key factors affecting prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of existing single-family homes for sale in August was up 5% from January, seasonally adjusted, Kolko says. Meanwhile, higher prices have dampened investor activity, leaving more homes for regular buyers, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While popular homes got 10 to 15 offers several months ago, two to three are more likely now, says Better Homes' Chris.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Slowing price gains should lessen fears of housing bubbles in some markets, including in California, Zillow says. Homes are also taking longer to sell in some California markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes spent a median of 28 days on the market in Oakland, in September before being sold, up from 14 days earlier this year, reports Realtor.com, which tracks 146 markets.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The North American Securities Administrators Association expanded its top 10 investor threats to 15 this year to accommodate new small- business scams.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the threats have been long-standing scams popular in the nation's five-star boiler rooms -- risky (or fake) oil and gas drilling schemes, for example, as well as fake high-yielding investments. The latter would have been familiar to Charles Ponzi, the 1920s swindler who promised huge returns over short periods of time using investments in international postal reply coupons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But state securities regulators are seeing new schemes this year. Among them:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Proxy trading accounts. Swindlers get authorization to trade on your behalf.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Digital currency. Looking for a replacement for the greenback? If you own gold, you can lose money, but at least you're left with something you can hold in your hand. "Investors should be aware that investments that incorporate abstract money systems present very real risks, including the possibility of virtual reality leaving an investor virtually broke," the NASAA says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Self-directed IRAs. You can use your IRA money for a number of non-traditional investments, such as real estate or small businesses. But because the process can be complicated, self- directed IRAs are a good way for criminals to tap into the public's distrust of Wall Street and scam your money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crowd-funding scams. The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act has made it easier for small businesses to raise capital from investors, but it has also made it easier for con artists to rise bling money from marks. Small businesses are increasingly getting ripped off by crowd-funding portals, which promise to do the hard work for you, the NASAA says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just because there are new scams out there, don't forget the old ones, which are remarkably effective in relieving investors from their cash. Typically, these scams involve whatever is popular or in the news -- oil and gas schemes, for example.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't feel safe because it's a friend who's offering a great new investment deal. Many fraudsters reach out and put the touch on friends, families and church members.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another favorite scam: real estate investment schemes, which piggyback on the rising housing market. "Even as housing prices continue to recover in many U.S. markets, investors should be aware that schemes related to new real estate development projects or buying, renovating, flipping or pooling distressed properties, are popular with con artists," the NASAA says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Always check out brokers soliciting your business. One place to start: the <span class="companylink">Securities and Exchange Commission</span>'s Investment Adviser Public Disclosure site. If your investment adviser is registered with the SEC, you can check out his record with the SEC at www.sec.gov[http://www.sec.gov]. You can check your broker's record through the <span class="companylink">Financial Industry Regulatory Authority</span>'s (FINRA) BrokerCheck website (www.finra.org[http://www.finra.org]).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the full list of 2013's scams, or to find out how to contact your state securities regulator, go to www.nasaa.org[http://www.nasaa.org].</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given how many Baby Boomers are entering retirement with little to no savings, the Golden Years have become the Frugal Years for an entire generation of retirees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With that in mind, AARP The Magazine published a list this month of the best places to retire on $30,000 a year. Surveys show Boomers have not saved enough for retirement, and many rely solely on Social Security payments. Boomers are nearly half a million dollars short when it comes to how much they've saved for retirement compared with how much they think they need, according to a <span class="companylink">TD Ameritrade</span> survey from last year. And nearly a third say they wouldn't be able to live comfortably in retirement without Social Security benefits. The average couple receives $2,048 a month in benefits, according to the <span class="companylink">Social Security Administration</span>. That's about $24,500 a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Working on the premise that on average, people spend one-third of their income on housing, AARP asked a demographer to help identify cities where that would be both possible on $30,000 a year and enjoyable, says Gabrielle Redford, editorial project manager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To compile the list, editors considered financial factors such as median home prices and property taxes, as well as lifestyle factors such as inexpensive entertainment and restaurants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daytona/Deltona/Ormond Beach. Retire on the beach on a budget. Here, the median home price is $108,900; you can grab tacos on Daytona's North Beach, and go fishing on the Atlantic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pocatello, Idaho. Outdoors enthusiasts may want to consider this Idaho town, population 88,500, for retirement. Median home price is $127,500 in an area with access to skiing, hiking, biking, horseback riding and water sports such as white-water rafting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bangor, Maine. Another draw for the outdoorsy type with access to hiking trails and water activities. The median home price in Bangor is $110,400, and it has a "lively" arts scene.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greenville, S.C. You don't have to give up the city to live cheaply. A lower cost of living attracts retirees to this Southern city, where the median home price is $127,600.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Grand Rapids, Mich. The largest city on AARP's top five list, the median home price is lower than in smaller cities like Greenville and Pocatello, at $114,200. Catch a Grand Rapids Griffins hockey game, the blues fest at Rosa Parks Circle, or browse art at the international ArtPrize competition downtown.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> has agreed to pay $395 million to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> to settle claims on home loans it sold to the government-controlled mortgage finance company. The agreement involves 3.7 million mortgages sold from 2000 to 2012. Freddie and its bigger sibling, <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, pressed <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> and other big banks to take back mortgages they sold, which soured in the housing bust. In July, <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> agreed to pay $968 million to settle similar claims from Fannie. Other banks have made similar settlements, including <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>, which paid $2.6 billion in 2011 to end claims on home loans it sold to Fannie and Freddie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DO YOU FEEL RICHER?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOUSEHOLD NET WORTH IS UP</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve says household net worth rose $1.3 trillion in the spring, thanks to home and stock value gains. Net worth rose to $74.8 trillion in the April-June quarter, up 1.8% from the first quarter. Americans' wealth fell to $57.2 trillion in 2008 in the Great Recession. Household wealth, or net worth, reflects the value of such assets as homes, stocks and bank accounts minus debts such as mortgages and credit card balances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW HOME SALES RISE, REVERSING JULY DROP</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home sales rebounded in August after a plunge in July, the Census Bureau reports. August sales rose 7.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 421,000. In July, sales dropped 14.1% to a 390,000 annual rate. New-home sales were 12.6% higher in August than a year ago, although the pace remains well below the 700,000 consistent with a healthy market.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices rose strongly in July, but the rate of increase may have topped out, a closely followed industry barometer shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices were up 12.4% for the 12 months through July, according to the 20-city <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller index released Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">July prices were also up a robust 1.8% from June. However, when adjusted for seasonal factors, July prices were up 0.6% from June. That's the smallest month-to-month increase since September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More cities are seeing slowing gains each month, suggesting the rate of increase "may have peaked," says David Blitzer, chairman of the index panel at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The price slowdown is real," says Jed Kolko, chief economist for real estate website <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>. Slimmer price increases are being driven by increasing numbers of homes for sale and declining investor purchases, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since January, the inventory of existing homes for sale has risen 5%, on a seasonally adjusted basis, Kolko says. Individual investors accounted for 17% of sales in August, down from 22% in February, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slowing is evident in numerous markets. When adjusted for seasonal factors, Miami prices were up 0.5% in July from June. They had risen 1.2% in June from May, Case-Shiller data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Portland, Ore., prices were also up 0.5% in July, vs. a 1% jump in June from May. San Diego prices were up 1.5% in July, vs. a 2.2% rise in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with slower monthly gains, prices have staged a remarkable run-up this year. The 20-city Case-Shiller index shows non- seasonally adjusted prices up 11.2% from December through July vs. 5.9% last year. That's the fastest rate of growth for that time period since 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price gains need to slow more to be sustainable, given flat incomes, says Stan Humphries, Zillow chief economist. Prices in Los Angeles, for instance, rose 1.5% in July from June, when adjusted for seasonal factors. That's still four times faster than the rate of growth for that city from 1985 to 2000, Humphries says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists expected higher interest rates, which spiked in May, to slow home sales and price gains. Last week, the Fed said it would not yet reduce its monthly purchases of government mortgage- backed securities and Treasury bonds, which has kept long-term interest rates low.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strong existing-home sales in August may result in weaker numbers in the coming months if buyers rush to close deals anticipating higher interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales increased 1.7% in August from July, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Thursday. Expect to see "payback" in September and October, says Patrick Newport, IHS Global Insight economist. Interest rates started rising in May and pushed buyers to close deals, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total existing-home sales in August rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.48 million from 5.39 million in July. They were 13.2% higher than a year ago, NAR says. That's the highest in over six years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market may be seeing a temporary peak, says Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist. Monthly sales "are likely to be uneven in the months ahead," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve's decision Wednesday not to taper its purchase of mortgage-backed securities, and to keep interest rates low, gives borrowers another "window of opportunity" to refinance mortgages or get home loans at still-low rates, says Doug Duncan, Fannie Mae chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average rate for a 30-year-fixed rate loan was 4.5% for the week ended Thursday, up from 3.49% a year ago, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> says. Rates drifted down from the week before amid signs of a weakening economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed's decision won't cause mortgage rates to plunge, says Bob Walters, Quicken Loans economist. He expects them to stay on the same trajectory of a "slow march higher."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher rates took the biggest bite out of refinancing. If rates temporarily trend lower, given the Fed's decision, the refi market could see the biggest bump, says Frank Pallotta, of finance company Loan Value Group. Some fence sitters may also be lured to buy, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The August home sales numbers reveal a far healthier market than a year ago. Foreclosed or short-sale homes accounted for 12% of sales, down from 23% a year ago, NAR says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median single-family home price hit $212,000, 14.4% higher than a year ago. Tight inventory is limiting choices and helping prices, Yun says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That may be especially true in the West, where August sales actually dropped 2.3% from July and median prices rose more than 18%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, the supply of homes for sale fell to 4.9 months in August from five months in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past, new and existing home sales have dropped three months after interest rate spikes, says <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> economist Jed Kolko. That didn't happen after May's spike, given a strengthening economy, slight expansion in for-sale inventory and some loosening in lending standards, he says.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Millennials content to rent ; Homeownership is a tough sale for a don't-tie-me-down generation</span>
</div><div class="author">Hadley Malcolm </div><div>Hadley Malcolm, @hadleypdxdc, USA TODAY</div>
<div>1040 words</div><div>17 September 2013</div><div>USA Today (Newspaper)</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.1</div><div>English</div><div>© 2013 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sam Lustgarten could be one of the growing number of "career renters" real estate companies think Millennials will become -- at least in the near term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 24-year-old Ph.D. student at the <span class="companylink">University of Iowa</span> in Iowa City lives in campus housing for about $490 a month, and plans to continue doing so until he finishes his program in counseling psychology in five years. At that point, he'll have close to $60,000 in loan debt. Right now, he says, he can envision renting for the rest of his life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't want to take on more debt," he says. "I don't want to have another credit check; I don't want to talk to another set of bankers; and I don't want to put so much liability on the line."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many Americans hard hit by the recession or dealing with large student loan debt, the idea of renting indefinitely has become appealing. No mortgage to pay off, a living space that comes with built-in amenities, and a landlord who takes care of upkeep and maintenance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This may be particularly true for the country's youngest adults, who are delaying homeownership and for whom taking on a mortgage is seen as one more debt to pay off. From 2006 through 2011, 25- to 34- year-olds experienced the largest decline in homeownership compared with any other age group, according to a USA TODAY analysis of Census Bureau data. Among households headed by 25- to 34-year-olds, renters increased by more than a million from 2006 to 2011, while the number who own fell nearly 1.4 million, the analysis shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today's young adults are not only delaying homeownership, they're delaying many of the life events that often come with it, including marriage, children and settled careers. The flexibility to be able to pick up and leave an apartment building or city for a job can be crucial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NOT ATTACHED TO OWNING</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For C.J. Wetzler, the decision to rent long term is motivated as much by finances as by lifestyle. The 30-year-old says his salary as a high school science teacher makes buying a place unrealistic. But he says flexibility is the biggest factor in choosing to continue renting after recently moving from West Palm Beach, Fla., to Coconut Creek, Fla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I feel at ease knowing if I had to relocate, the process would be less complicated," Wetzler says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But like Lustgarten, he's also averse to putting himself in a bind. "I know a house can be an investment, but I'm not looking to go $100,000 in debt with a teacher's salary."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate companies say they've noticed rental residents are now more often single, older and staying longer than in past decades. And those who do move out are more often moving to another rental over buying a home, says Mark Obrinsky, chief economist for the National Multi Housing Council, a group that represents apartment firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Obrinsky says the trend makes sense given Millennials' affinity for renting just about everything else, from cars like <span class="companylink">Zipcar</span> to clothes through sites like Rent the Runway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A lot of young people don't have the same attachment to ownership of anything," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An iffy job market has also continued to permeate other aspects of Millennials' lives, especially where and how they live.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They entered the job market when it was harder to find a job, and the effects of entering the labor market when jobs are scarce are long term," says Jed Kolko, chief economist at real estate site <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pierre Calzadilla, a spokesman for <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>'s rental division, says he notices more people looking for roommates in <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> postings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To some extent, real estate developers anticipated this trend, and started offering rental units in locations attracting young professionals to meet demand, often equipped with high-end amenities such as roof-top pools, gyms, brand-new kitchen appliances and social events for the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GOING HIGH-END</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Pangea Real Estate started in 2009, the company was created to take advantage of an opportunity to provide high-quality properties to an anticipated surge in renters during and in the wake of the recession, says Chief Acquisition Officer Pete Martay. Pangea redevelops distressed properties into multifamily apartments with hardwood floors, kitchens with new appliances, new bathrooms and sometimes balconies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In light of where we are in the economy, people are still looking for a quality place to live, but they're not interested in a long-term deployment of their capital in homeownership," Martay says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pangea operates 8,000 rental units across more than 275 properties in Chicago, Indianapolis and Baltimore. It has plans to add 1,000 more units to its portfolio in the next couple of months, Martay says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers say renting appeals to today's young adults not only because it requires less responsibility but also for its ease in urban areas. Even before the recession halted job growth and demolished the housing industry, <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span> decided to ditch the apartment complexes it operated in smaller markets such as Detroit and Minneapolis to focus on major metropolitan cities that were attracting young adults. Now the real estate company operates nearly 400 properties in cities including Boston, New York and San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think they are embracing the social lifestyle of high-density urban living," says Equity Residential CEO David Neithercut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, many housing-industry leaders insist the desire to become a homeowner has not diminished, even among Millennials. A <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> survey conducted in June found that 94% of renters ages 18-34 plan to buy a home someday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The increase in renting is about current economic realities, not a long-term shift in attitudes," Kolko says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others admit they just don't know which way the rental trend will tip as young adults age and start families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think that they believe that whatever their American dream is," Neithercut says, "it can be fulfilled without owning a home."</p>

</div><div class="author">Gregory Korte   </div><div>Gregory Korte, @gregorykorte, USA TODAY</div>
<div>704 words</div><div>16 September 2013</div><div>USA Today (Newspaper)</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>A.2</div><div>English</div><div>© 2013 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Tax expenditures" -- those deductions, credits, exclusions, loopholes and other goodies that clutter up the tax code -- now amount to nearly $1.2 trillion a year, the government says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not all corporate tax giveaways and special-interest handouts: More than 90% of federal tax breaks go to individual taxpayers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the government started accounting for tax preferences in 1974, the value of individual tax breaks has increased seven times faster than that of corporations, according to a USA TODAY analysis of tax expenditure data collected by the National Priorities Project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"One of the things that we found -- and it's perhaps the underlying reason why the tax conversation is so complicated -- is that the tax code really does cut across people of all income brackets in this country. Every income group gets some kind of tax expenditure," said Jo Comerford, the group's director.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And many of the most popular individual tax breaks are among the fastest-growing. Individual taxpayers are likely to save a total of $45.8 billion in 2014 because of a provision exempting home sales from capital gains taxes -- nearly double the amount from five years before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Non-taxable Social Security benefits will save retired and disabled people $32.9 billion, up 59% since 2009. Employees will save $212.8billion because their employer-provided health benefits aren't taxed, a 47% increase from 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those individual tax breaks could complicate what seems to be the most serious effort by Congress to overhaul the tax system in 27 years. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 tamed individual tax breaks for nearly a decade -- until Congress added in more tax breaks in a 1997 law that cut capital gains tax rates, exempted taxes on most home sales and enacted a child credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the recent growth in individual tax breaks is attributable to economic factors: a rebound in the housing market, increased health care costs and increased 401(k) contributions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congress has also played a role in expanding tax breaks. "The tax code has been used as an additional means to provide welfare spending," said William McBride, the chief economist at the business- oriented <span class="companylink">Tax Foundation</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McBride argues that some popular low-income tax benefits like the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit are, in some ways, worse than welfare spending. They're less transparent, more open to abuse, face less congressional oversight and are poorly administered by the <span class="companylink">Internal Revenue Service</span>, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other end of the spectrum are critics of the preferred treatment of capital gains and investment income. "Everybody wants to raise revenue by getting rid of tax expenditures, but I think people are focused on the wrong ones," said Steve Wamhoff, legislative director of <span class="companylink">Citizens for Tax Justice</span>. "If you have a spending program and 68% of that money goes to the richest 1%, most people would think that's pretty bad."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's what the lower rate for capital gains does, according to a <span class="companylink">Congressional Budget Office</span> report released in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two lawmakers tasked most with writing tax laws -- Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus, D-Mont., and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman David Camp, R-Mich. -- have endorsed a "blank slate" approach to tax reform, eliminating all tax breaks and forcing their colleagues to justify adding them back in. They've just returned from a bipartisan summer tour of the country to get input from taxpayers and sell the concept.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Priorities Project, a non-profit group that researches federal budget issues, collected cost estimates for 296 tax expenditures dating to 1974, when the government first started disclosing them in annual budget documents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Becky Sweger, the group's director of data and technology, said most Americans don't think of tax breaks as spending -- partly because some are breaks they never see, such as the exclusion of employer health plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I used to think, 'Who gets all these horrible tax breaks?' And when I charted those, I saw the top three are me. I get all of those," she said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adele and Josue Montoya missed the housing bubble and bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the first-time home shoppers are in a situation not unlike that faced by millions of Americans in the years preceding the start of the housing collapse in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, as now, home prices were rising rapidly in the Sacramento area where they live. Investors chasing fat profits on rising prices were a big part of the U.S. housing market, just as they are now. Buyers, such as the Montoyas, thought prices would go up further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One thing is very different: It's far harder to get a home loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To pre-qualify for a home loan, the Montoyas had to submit reams of documents to show that they could actually afford it. That often didn't happen in the loose-lending days leading up to the housing bust, which helped drive <span class="companylink">Lehman Bros</span>. into bankruptcy five years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's more, new lending rules have been put in place to guard against the worst lending abuses that fueled the housing bubble, the mortgage industry says. But critics say the rules aren't shaping up to be tough enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've created this false sense that we've made mortgages low risk," says Edward Pinto, resident fellow at the <span class="companylink">American Enterprise Institute</span>. "But as time goes on and the push for looser lending occurs the same thing could happen again."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the housing bubble from 2000 to 2006, U.S. home prices rose by an inflation-adjusted 76%, based on Case-Shiller data. The bubble was fed by low interest rates, easy credit, scant regulation, toxic mortgages and, some economists argue, a false belief that home prices couldn't fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trillions of dollars in risky mortgages became embedded in the U.S. financial system as the loans were packaged, turned into securities and sold to investors. Lehman bet on rising property prices, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The change in lending standards since the bust is hard to miss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2006, 16% of new home loans were subprime, meaning they went to borrowers with credit scores below 620. Last year, just 0.2% of new home loans were subprime, according to mortgage tracker Lender Processing Services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By 2006, loans issued with little or no documentation of borrowers' finances made up more than one in four mortgages, says the <span class="companylink">Center for Responsible Lending</span>. As the recession hit, and home prices tanked, many of those borrowers found they couldn't afford their home loans anymore. All told, an estimated 7 million homes have been lost to foreclosure or short sale in the housing bust, says market researcher RealtyTrac.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The change isn't bad, says Adele Montoya, 38. She works as an office supervisor. Her husband works as a produce supervisor in a grocery chain. The couple want to know they can afford any loan they get.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't want any surprises down the road," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signs of easing</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lending standards "remain tight" but have eased slightly in recent quarters, says Jonathan Corr, CEO of mortgage tracker Ellie Mae.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August, the average FICO score for a closed home loan was 734, down from 748 for all of last year, show data to be released next week by Ellie Mae. The top FICO score is 850. The average down payment was 18%, vs. 21% last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corr says lenders appear to be easing standards, given rising home prices and higher interest rates, which cut into refinance volumes, leaving lenders to look for more business from home purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising home prices also reduce the risk of loan defaults. After falling more than 30% from their 2006 peak, U.S. home prices were up 12.1% in June over 12 months, Case-Shiller says. They're still about 23% off their 2006 peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the bust recedes, look for further easing in mortgage lending as the housing industry tries to drum up business, says Anthony Sanders, real estate finance professor at <span class="companylink">George Mason University</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's a lot of money in weak credit standards," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reducing lending risks</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are some new safeguards, however.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are in an entirely different universe than the unregulated period" before the bubble, says David Stevens, CEO of the Mortgage Bankers Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One big change is that, starting in January, lenders must make home loans that meet new federal qualified mortgage standards or face greater liability from borrower lawsuits, should the loans go sour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the risky loans that fed the housing bubble are outside the new standards. Those include interest-only loans and loans that push borrowers' debt above 43% of their income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders could still make those loans. But borrowers could sue to recoup losses or stop foreclosures if they went into default.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The standards put a "set of documented rules" around what lenders are doing today, Corr says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If loans are resold to investors, shifting risk, other rules will come into play. Those are still being developed by six federal agencies, including the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commis-sion. The current proposal is for those loans to meet the same standards dictated by the qualified mortgage rule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2011, regulators had proposed a 20% down payment for loans sold to investors, or lenders would have to retain 5% of the risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, the 20% down payment condition was dropped amid opposition from the real estate industry and consumer groups. They argued it would hurt the housing market, including first-time buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The typical American family would have to direct every penny of savings for 16 years to a housing down payment if 20% was required, said the Coalition for Sensible Housing Policy, which includes real estate, banking and consumer groups. They also argue that low-down- payment loans work as long as lenders make sure consumers can afford loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sanders says higher down payments guard against mortgage defaults. Even before the new rule gets out the door, "it's being weakened," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Echoes of past bubbles</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Loose lending standards weren't the only factor driving the bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An even bigger factor may have been the widespread expectation that home prices would only go up, says Harvard economics professor Edward Glaeser.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The same optimism has long fueled real estate bubbles in America, including the frontier land boom of the 1790s, the Alabama land boom in 1820, the skyscraper craze of the 1920s and the Southern California housing boom in the 1990s, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's the same American instinct to gamble on land," Glaeser says, noting that even George Washington was a big land speculator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's more, the U.S. tax code still encourages home ownership through the mortgage interest deduction, Glaeser notes. The government also now backs more home loans than ever, about 85% of new loans through <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span>. While reducing the government's role in the home loan business is being discussed, reforms are likely years away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest impediment to another housing bubble might be that "a whole generation of buyers have seen that housing can go down," says Discover Home Loans economist Cameron Findlay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. homeownership rate has fallen from a record high of 69.2% in 2004 to 65% and could drop to 63.5%, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the Montoyas have decided to hold off on buying in the frenzied Sacramento market, where prices were up almost 27% in July year-over-year. They expect new home construction to add to the supply of homes for sale, increasing their chances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're just going to wait," Adele Montoya says.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nation's slow but steady recovery continued over the summer, with all regions reporting modest to moderate growth on persistent strength in the auto and housing sectors, a Federal Reserve report said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer spending and the housing market continued to pick up, while manufacturing expanded modestly from early July to late August, according to the Fed's "beige book" survey of economic conditions in the 12 Fed bank districts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Growth was moderate in eight districts, while four -- Boston, Atlanta, San Francisco and Chicago -- posted a more modest expansion. The survey, named for the color of its cover, provides an anecdotal snapshot of the economy rather than the hard data of economic reports. It could be key in determining whether the Fed reins in its bond-buying stimulus, as many economists expect, when Fed policymakers meet Sept. 18.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buoyed partly by back-to-school sales, consumer spending rose in most regions. Retail sales rose moderately in Boston, Kansas City and Dallas and more modestly in Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago and St. Louis, among other areas. Strong demand for home furnishings and home improvement drove demand in many districts. But in several areas, including Philadelphia, consumers remained cautious and price- sensitive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The auto market, however, keeps surging on a well of pent-up demand. In New York, sales of "high-end brands were especially robust," the report said. And in Richmond, Va., one dealership had its best month ever. In Minneapolis, a lack of inventory crimped sales at some dealers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Travel and tourism also showed solid gains, with the industry expanding in the Boston, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis and San Francisco areas. Camping permits and visits to state and national parks "increased substantially" in the Richmond and Philadelphia regions. Broadway ticket sales rose in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturing, meanwhile, expanded only modestly in many areas. Atlanta industry officials said new orders and production had dropped a bit. Auto production spurred increases across the country, particularly in Chicago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing-related activity also boosted factories. In Richmond, a lumber company bought new equipment to expand its output, while demand for construction equipment and materials increased in Chicago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Kansas City and San Francisco areas, however, the effects of federal budget cuts resulted in less industrial production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market continued an expansion that recently has juiced the recovery. In New York, sales of condos and co-ops were "unusually strong" over the summer. And in the Cleveland area, existing home sales "were up substantially" over a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rather than dampening sales, recently rising home prices and mortgage rates have spurred a pickup in several areas "as many fence sitters were prompted to commit to purchases," the Fed said. Commercial real estate activity also picked up, with office vacancy rates improving in New York, Richmond and St. Louis. Lending, however, pulled back in several areas -- including Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis and San Francisco -- after expanding in the spring. In Chicago, recent increases in interest rates were depressing commercial investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hiring, meanwhile, "held steady or increased somewhat" in most areas, reflecting government reports of a recent moderation in job gains. In Cleveland, retail payroll gains "were limited to new stores."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there was growing demand for information technology and health care workers. And in Boston and Richmond, a rising number of temporary workers received offers for permanent jobs.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New homes could get more expensive in the coming months as a shortage of suitable lots drives up builders' costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 27 leading markets, the average price of a finished lot ready for building was up 40% in the second quarter from a year ago, according to <span class="companylink">John Burns Real Estate</span> Consulting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even steeper increases have hit some markets that have also seen strong gains in home values and demand. Year over year, finished lot values were up 87% in San Francisco and Oakland, 75% in Atlanta and 70% in Las Vegas. The big jumps are "making up for lost ground" during the housing downturn, says David Crowe, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The higher lot prices may foreshadow higher home prices months from now. Finished lot prices represent almost 22% of a new home's price, Crowe says. Finished lot prices there were up 65% in the second quarter from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bigger homes are coming along with higher land and lot prices. The average size of a new home hit a record 2,642-square-feet in the second quarter, the Census Bureau says. Some first-time buyers have dropped out of the new-home market because of rising interest rates, Webb says. That means repeat buyers, who are financially better off, make up more of the market, and they want to move into larger homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lot prices have risen fast because of their limited supply, especially in popular neighborhoods, and strengthening demand for new homes. July new-home sales, while down 13.4% from June, were still almost 7% higher than last year, the Commerce Department says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, few lots were developed during the home-building downturn that began in 2006. When housing started to pick up, builders got caught short.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's been a big jump in demand for something in scarce supply," says Jody Kahn, vice president with <span class="companylink">John Burns Real Estate</span> Consulting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices for raw land -- which will turn into finished lots months or years from now -- have also soared in many markets. Since late 2012, raw land prices in parts of Las Vegas have more than doubled, says Dennis Smith, CEO of the Las Vegas-based Home Builders Research. Land prices have also doubled in Phoenix since that market bottomed in 2010, says land broker Nate Nathan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finished lot prices in Dallas, Houston and Austin have rebounded past their 2005-2007 peaks, Burns' data show. All three cities saw job growth of 3% or more, vs. 1.7% nationally, in the 12 months through June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crowe doesn't expect lot prices to keep growing at their current pace. As developers and builders refill the pipeline, price gains will slow. "This year is the big bump," Kahn says.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">More homeowners above water ; Rising home prices help</span>
</div><div class="author">Julie Schmit   </div><div>Julie Schmit, USA TODAY,</div>
<div>518 words</div><div>30 August 2013</div><div>USA Today (Newspaper)</div><div>USAT</div><div>First</div><div>B.2</div><div>English</div><div>© 2013 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A big jump in home values has pulled 3.2 million homeowners above water on their mortgages in the past year, but that pace will slow if home price gains taper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of June, 12.2 million homeowners with mortgages -- 23.8% -- remained underwater, owing more on their mortgages than their homes were worth, according to an analysis by Zillow. That's down from 15.3 million a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop in underwater borrowers correlated with a robust jump in home prices, which were up 12.1% for the 12 months ended in June, Case-Shiller's 20-city index shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fewer underwater homeowners is a "big plus" for the economy, says Mark Zandi, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics. "The home is still the most important asset most Americans have."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising home values make people feel wealthier so they're more likely to spend. On the flip side, if homeowners are underwater, they're more cautious with spending, Zandi says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Underwater borrowers are also more likely to default on home loans, which can weigh on surrounding home values. They also face more obstacles to refinance into lower-cost mortgages, which can also hurt their spending, says Svenja Gudell, Zillow senior economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While millions of homeowners remain underwater, another 18% of mortgaged homeowners have 20% or less equity in their homes, Zillow's data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That much equity is generally needed to sell one home and have enough funds to buy another one. The swollen ranks of underwater and low-equity homeowners have affected the existing home market, Zandi says. Many people feel they can't sell, or they don't want to sell, at today's prices, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with the rapid home price gains in the past year, 57% of underwater homeowners carry mortgage debt that's 20% or more what their homes are worth, Zillow says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will take years for them to regain equity, even as home values continue to recover. Some homeowners may never get back to a positive-equity situation, Gudell says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the top 30 markets covered by Zillow, Las Vegas has the most deeply underwater homeowners. Almost 13% of mortgaged homeowners there owe twice or more what their home is worth, Zillow says. Miami is second with 8.7% of mortgaged homeowners in that situation, followed by Detroit at 8.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, Las Vegas also has the highest percentage of mortgaged homeowners who are underwater, at 48.4%. Atlanta is next at 44% and Orlando at 39.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If home price gains slow, as many economists expect, the reduction in the number of underwater borrowers will slow, too. Over the next year, Zillow forecasts another 1.9 million homeowners will rise above water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, mortgage finance giant <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> reported Thursday that the average 30-year mortgage rate fell to 4.51% for the week ended Aug. 29, down from 4.58% a week ago. The average 15-year fixed mortgage fell to 3.54% from 3.60% a week ago.</p>

</div><div class="author">Julie Schmit   </div><div>523 words</div><div>28 August 2013</div><div>USA Today (Newspaper)</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.2</div><div>English</div><div>© 2013 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices were up strongly in June, but prices aren't rising as fast as before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">June home prices were up 12.1% from a year earlier and 0.9% from May, when adjusted for seasonal factors, the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case- Shiller 20-city index showed Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That monthly rise was roughly half that seen in March. Meanwhile, the national index posted a 2.3% seasonally adjusted jump in the second quarter from the first. That was sharply lower than the 3.8% rise in the first quarter from last year's fourth. "We're definitely seeing slowing," says Stan Humphries of real estate website Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its data also show home values rising more slowly: up 0.4% in July from June. They rose 0.8% in June from May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With 30-year mortgage rates averaging almost 4.6%, "Home buyers may be discouraged, and sharp increases may be dampened," says David Blitzer, chairman of S&amp;P's index committee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices are still rising plenty fast. The June monthly gain is equal to an annualized rate of around 11%. Gains could slow much more and still be healthy, says Jed Kolko, chief economist for real estate website <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There isn't strong evidence yet of a slowdown," says Robert Shiller, co-creator of the index. He says the housing recovery still has strong momentum. Some markets have seen a shift, however.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Detroit prices fell 1.4% in June from May, following a 2.4% gain in May from April, Case-Shiller seasonally adjusted numbers show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seattle posted a 0.9% jump in June from May, down from a 1.4% monthly gain in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Minneapolis prices fell 1.1% on a seasonally adjusted basis in June from May. They fell 0.4% in May from April. "The market is still strong, but it's slowed," says Minneapolis ReMax Realtor Jason Stockwell. More homes are taking longer to sell, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Redfin's data show price reductions in August occurring on almost 15% of active listings across 22 major markets nationwide. That's up from about 10% in February and March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, asking prices were up 3.3%, on a seasonally adjusted basis, in May, June and July from the previous three months, <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> says. That's down from the 4.2% jump in the three months ended in January vs. the three months ended in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More homes for sale is part of the reason. Nationwide, the for- sale home inventory was down 5.2% in July from a year ago. That was an improvement from January when it was down 16% year over year, Realtor.com says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home values will rise 4.8% from July of this year to next July, Zillow predicts. That's slower than in the past year but still far stronger than the historical norm of 3.5% a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any slowdown in price gains "will not be dramatic," says Ed Stansfield of Capital Economics. Smaller price gains would reduce the risk of another housing bubble, he adds.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales rose 6.5% in July, reaching their highest level in almost four years, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes sold at a 5.39 million seasonally adjusted annual rate, the group said, handily beating economists' forecasts of a 5.15 million sales pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales rate was up 17% from the same month last year, and the highest since November, 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We haven't had three straight months of 5 million or greater since the second quarter of 2007," NAR spokesman Walter Molony said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"To go back and find a month with a higher sales volume, without the benefit of federal tax credits, you have to go back to March 2007."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ongoing strength of the housing market was cited in the minutes of the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Markets Committee, which were released Wednesday, as a primary reason the Fed thinks economic growth will accelerate by later this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The key for the economy is whether the stronger market, coupled with a shortage of homes for sale, will prompt home builders to step up construction and add jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics says a jump from less than 1 million new homes a year to 1.7 million, which it considers the underlying level of demand for newly built housing, could add more than 3 million jobs by 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"More home building is the key to getting back to full employment," <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> chief economist Mark Zandi said in an e-mail. "The day we are back to 1.7 million units annualized is the day the unemployment rate will fall below 6%."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors said July's median home price, where half of all homes are more expensive and half are less expensive, was $213,500, up 14% from last July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was the biggest year-over-year gain since 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of sales in the market may be slowed soon by higher interest rates, but tight inventories of homes for sale should keep prices rising, NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Mortgage interest rates are at the highest level in two years, pushing some buyers off the sidelines," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The initial rise in interest rates provided strong incentive for closing deals. However, further rate increases will diminish the pool of eligible buyers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest rates on 30-year mortgages have risen by a full percentage point since May, driven by speculation about when the Federal Reserve will slow the pace of its bond-buying program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the buyer of a median-price house who puts 20% down, that raises the monthly payment by about $100.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The bottom line is that the housing market remains in a recovery phase, albeit one that could be tempered by higher mortgage rates and worsening affordability," <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> economist Michael Gapen said in a note to clients after the NAR released its report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The recovery in housing will prove resilient to any broader slowing in the economy and the recent rise in mortgage interest rates to date, but we will be watching for any signs of weakness or fragility as a result of the significant rise in real interest rates."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The risk is that last month's gains in demand may prove temporary, and driven by buyers who rushed to lock in a home before interest rates went up, economist Joel Naroff, of Naroff Economic Advisors, said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kerry Fisher lost at least eight homes in the past four months to faster and more cash-rich buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But recently an agent called her, asking if she was still interested in a home she thought she'd lost. She expects to close on the $195,000 condominium later this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That was different," says the 41-year-old escrow assistant, who lives in Orange County, Calif., one of the nation's hottest real estate markets the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her experience points to a slightly kinder housing market for buyers in parts of the U.S., especially the West, as more homes come on the market, asking prices show signs of slowing and higher interest rates keep more shoppers at home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The market has become significantly more balanced," says Glenn Kelman, CEO of real estate brokerage Redfin. "There just isn't the madness we saw before."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through June this year, U.S. home values gained 10%, <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> says. That's the fastest pace since 1977, but there are signs that may not last much longer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, asking prices -- a leading indicator of sale prices - - were up 3.3%, on a seasonally adjusted basis, in May, June and July from the previous three months, according to real estate website <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That increase is robust, but it's less than the 4.2% jump that occurred from the three months ended in January vs. the three months ended in April, <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some of the hottest real estate markets, including Las Vegas, San Francisco and Portland, Ore., increases in asking prices have narrowed even more in recent months, <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending home sales -- which typically result in final sales a month or two later -- also dipped in June, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> says. Rising interest rates started to weigh on buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market's pace is "a little less frenzied," says NAR economist Danielle Hale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FEWER BIDDING WARS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strong competition for homes has helped drive prices higher. But bidding wars appear to be ebbing a bit as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July, 63% of buyers' offers on Redfin faced competition in 22 markets coast to coast, its data show. That's down from 68% in June and the peak of 76% in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some markets saw even bigger monthly drops. Boston fell to 65% of offers in July from 74% in June. San Francisco eased to almost 80% of offers from 90%, Redfin says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the slowdown is likely seasonal. People go on vacation in July. More inventory also plays a role. Nationwide, the seasonally adjusted inventory of homes for sale was up 6% in June from January, NAR data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's been a surge of inventory," says Robin Kingsbury, agent with Red Oak Realty in the San Francisco Bay Area. "But that means instead of getting 15 offers, you'll get five to eight."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, the for-sale home inventory was down 5.2% in July from a year ago. That was an improvement from January when it was down 16% year over year, Realtor.com says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From June, inventory was up 1.4% in July. Some markets, especially in the West, posted bigger monthly gains. San Diego had a 13% jump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Los Angeles and Orange County, where Fisher was shopping, saw inventories rise 8%. Orlando was up 12%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Larger inventories, especially in the hotter markets that experienced rapid price increases in the spring, are expanding buyers' choices and helping to moderate price increases," says Steve Berkowitz, CEO of Move, which operates Realtor.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SLOWING HOME VALUE GROWTH</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Growth in median home values in some markets has been slowing, says Zillow economist Svenja Gudell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Miami, for instance, median home values increased 0.7% in May from April and 0.6% in June from May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the previous five months, values rose at least 1% month to month, Zillow data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Values in San Jose rose about 1% month to month in May and June. They increased at a 2%-plus clip in the three prior months, Zillow says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Slowing price gains wouldn't be a bad thing, says John Burns, CEO of John Burns Real Estate Consulting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rapid appreciation encourages flipping -- when homes are bought and resold in short intervals for fast profits -- and pushes home prices into unaffordable territory as wage gains lag.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If prices keep rising as fast as they have been, "It will create a bubble," Burns says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zillow's panel of 106 economists and real estate experts predicts home values will end this year up 6.7%. Appreciation will slow to 4.4% next year, the panel says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kelman even expects prices to flatten or decline in some markets this fall as inventories increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It isn't just going to be up, up and up," he says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retailers have been sounding worry notes recently, and this week's parade of earnings reports from struggling players such as <span class="companylink">J.C.

Reports to watch this week: Today, <span class="companylink">Urban Outfitters</span>; Tuesday, <span class="companylink">Barnes &amp; Noble</span>, <span class="companylink">Best Buy</span>, <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>, <span class="companylink">J.C.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT TO WATCH</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE ECONOMY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two key reports this week will give investors a fresh reading on the strength of home sales in July. The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> will report on existing home sales on Wednesday, and the government's figures on new home sales will arrive Friday. One forecasting firm, IHS Global Insight, predicts existing home sales will rise to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.2 million from June's 5.08 million. New-home sales are projected to fall to a seasonally adjusted pace of 480,000 from June's 497,000, it says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EARNINGS REPORT CARD: BEATING EARLY EXPECTATIONS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With more than 90% of S&amp;P 500 companies having reported quarterly earnings, the results are coming in a shade better than analysts expected at the end of June, reports FactSet. The blended earnings growth rate -- combining actual results with estimates for unreported companies in the S&amp;P 500 -- is 2.1%, compared with an estimate of 0.6% growth on June 30.</p>

</div><div class="author">Julie Schmit   </div><div>Julie Schmit, @JulieSchmit, USA TODAY</div>
<div>472 words</div><div>19 August 2013</div><div>USA Today (Newspaper)</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.1</div><div>English</div><div>© 2013 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An era of exceptionally affordable housing is fading in some parts of the U.S. as stagnant incomes collide with rising prices and interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The share of median household income devoted to home mortgage payments recently surpassed historical averages in six of 30 major housing markets, according to John Burns Real Estate Consulting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five of those markets are in California -- San Francisco, Los Angeles, Orange County, San Jose and San Diego -- and the sixth is Portland, Ore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the bottom of the housing downturn, those cities were more affordable than their historical averages dating to 1980, Burns' data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But home prices have risen rapidly in those cities as the housing recovery has taken hold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices in Los Angeles and San Francisco were 21% higher in June than a year ago, compared with the national average increase of almost 12%, according to <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Affordability remains high in most of the rest of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the second quarter, 69% of new and existing homes sold were affordable to families earning the U.S. median income of $64,400, according to the latest National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Opportunity Index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is down from almost 74% of homes sold in the first quarter and marked the lowest level for affordability in more than four years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2006, at the height of the housing bubble, just 41% of homes sold were affordable for median income earners, the index shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low interest rates have been a big driver of affordability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rates will stay near current levels -- 4.4% for a 30-year, fixed- rate loan -- for the next month, predicts Frank Nothaft, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>'s chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But they'll crack 5% in mid-2014, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If so, the cost of housing in 30 of 250 metropolitan areas will exceed historical averages for affordability, according to an analysis from market watcher Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zillow's data show a Honolulu resident earning the median income spent about 36% of it on monthly mortgage payments from 1985 to 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With 5% interest rates, rising house prices and flat incomes, they would spend 40%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those 30 markets include Portland and the California cities identified by Burns, and also Denver, Ocean City, N.J., Bellingham, Wash., and Great Falls, Mont.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zillow's calculation is based on median home values, a 30-year mortgage and a 20% down payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the affordability gap widens, more consumers are likely to leave higher-cost areas in search of more affordable housing elsewhere, says Jed Kolko, <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices may also flatten or decline in areas with low affordability, Zillow economist Svenja Gudell says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The signs are pointed to affordability becoming an issue," Gudell says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It takes a heap of housing to make an economy hum, and that's why all eyes will be on today's release of July housing starts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A house starts with the excavation of the foundation, and that's what the Census Bureau counts as a housing start. The figure covers residential construction only.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why are housing starts so important? The construction industry was devastated by the 2007-2009 financial crisis. At its peak in 2006, there were 3.4 million people in the homebuilding industry, says Robert Denk, senior economist at the National Association of Homebuilders. There are about 2 million now. About 100,000 have been added this year, Denk says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Constructing 100 homes provides about 300 full-time jobs, the NAHB says. New homes create even more jobs: When you buy a house, you're also in the market for furniture, paint and plastic flamingos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Denk estimates that July will have had about 900,000 starts, vs. 836,000 in June. Much of June's disappointing numbers, however, was because of unusually wet weather, Denk says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The logical choice for a happy home starts number would be iShares U.S. Home Construction (ITB). The fund has plunged 20.2% the past three months, says Morningstar. Another choice: SPDR S&amp;P Homebuilders ETF (XHB).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the home starts number is really, really bad? At least your bond fund will be happy. Weak home sales means a weak economy, and a weak economy means lower yields and higher bond prices.</p>

<div>599 words</div><div>13 August 2013</div><div>USA Today (Newspaper)</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.1</div><div>English</div><div>© 2013 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After years of being the USA's foreclosure laughingstocks, Arizona and California now have better credit than the rest of us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's from an analysis released last week by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, which chronicled the performance of its $2.8 trillion loan portfolio. In states hit hardest by the housing bust -- Arizona, California, Nevada and Florida -- <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> used to see loans go bad from 11/ 2 to an excruciating eight times as often as the national average. That's changing fast -- except in Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only 7% of Fannie's 2013 credit losses come from California -- home to nearly 20% of its loans and 27% of its 2011 write-offs due to defaults and foreclosures. Arizona, with 2.4% of Fannie's outstanding balances, has seen its share of credit losses plunge to 1.8% in the first half of this year, from nearly 12% in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In each state, the share of local loans that wind up as Fannie's losses is now below the mortgage finance giant's national average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Florida, by contrast, accounts for almost 29% of <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>'s losses, up from 11% in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few Midwestern states also look riskier. <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> has 10% of its loans and 22% of its losses in Ohio, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan, which accounted for 12% of losses in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shift is caused mostly by two things: much longer foreclosure processes in states where courts approve them than where they don't; and prices are now rising very quickly in so-called "sand states" of Arizona, California and Nevada. Nevada is still responsible for 4.3% of losses, down from almost 8% two years ago, and 1% of loan balances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A third, less important factor is that the sand states' economies are adding jobs faster than in the four Midwestern states that Fannie's data highlight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because Fannie takes its credit losses when it completes the foreclosure on a bad loan and takes over the house, slower "judicial foreclosure" processes in states such as Florida, Illinois, Ohio and Indiana mean losses there are just being taken now, said Svenja Gudell, senior economist at real-estate site <span class="companylink">Zillow.com</span>. Foreclosures don't require court approval in Arizona and California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For loans in Arizona and Florida that began to go bad in 2009, the 775-day difference between how long the states take to complete foreclosures on average means that in many cases, homes in Arizona completed foreclosure by 2011, and the foreclosures in Florida are being completed this year, said Daren Blomquist, vice president of RealtyTrac, a real estate information firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What we see is the pig moving though the python," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House prices also play a role in how much Fannie loses on properties -- and may influence how many new foreclosures happen, said Jed Kolko, chief economist at the real estate website <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>. Nevada, Arizona and California have the three biggest percentage increases in home prices in the last year, Fannie says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average repossessed home Fannie sells in California fetches 85% of the unpaid loan balance, up from 64% in mid-2012 and better than the 62% in Ohio and Illinois now. That cuts Fannie's losses on resale. Tight inventories of homes for sale are pushing up prices in general, and slashing discounts for foreclosed-upon homes, Gudell said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average short sale in Arizona commands 77% of the balance, eight points better than in Illinois.</p>

</div><div class="author">Julie Schmit; Aamer Madhani   </div><div>Julie Schmit and Aamer Madhani, USA TODAY,</div>
<div>746 words</div><div>7 August 2013</div><div>USA Today (Newspaper)</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>A.6</div><div>English</div><div>© 2013 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost five years after taxpayers bailed out mortgage giants <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, President Obama said on Tuesday that it's time for private investors to take a bigger role in the mortgage market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fannie and Freddie collapsed in 2008 before being bailed out with almost $200 billion in taxpayer funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with the nation's real estate market on the mend, Obama said in an address in Phoenix on home ownership that it is time to wind down the two companies and make clear that the days of a guaranteed government bailout are over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For too long, these companies were allowed to make big profits buying mortgages, knowing that if their bets went bad, taxpayers would be left holding the bag," Obama said. "It was heads we win, tails you lose."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the better part of his time in the White House, Obama has faced calls to shake up <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, but the administration has held back on taking action while the housing market was weak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Obama's call to wind down the government's role in the U.S. mortgage finance market won't have an immediate impact on the mortgage market and probably not even one for years, mortgage experts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any efforts to reform <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> and <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, which currently fund two out of three new housing mortgages in the U.S., would likely take years, even if and after there's consensus on what to do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is the beginning of a long process," says Jed Kolko, an economist with real estate website <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With his remarks, Obama for the first time endorsed bipartisan efforts in the Senate on mortgage overhaul. He also made it clear that he expects any legislation to spell out a limited government role for backing Fannie and Freddie and that it must ensure Americans' continued access to a 30-year mortgage at a fixed interest rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I believe that while our housing system must have a limited government role, private lending should be the backbone of the housing market, including community-based lenders who view their borrowers not as a number, but as a neighbor," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it will create a tricky balance for lawmakers to reduce the mortgage market's dependence on government guarantees provided to Freddie and Fannie while retaining the 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages that those government guarantees help provide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal guarantee behind home loans backed by Freddie and Fannie are part of the reason mortgage availability has spread as widely as it has. When that "umbilical cord" is cut, it will need to be carefully done so that mortgage costs don't rise too high, says Herbert Kaufman, professor emeritus at the W.P.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in May turned in their best annual gain in more than seven years and set records in Denver and Dallas as the housing recovery continues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices were up 12.2% year-over-year, according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller 20-city composite index released Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dallas and Denver are the first two cities in the index to surpass their previous peaks, but the index shows the average price remains almost 25% below its mid-2006 peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rebound in some cities underscores how far the housing recovery has come -- especially where home prices didn't fall as far as in other markets or where there are strong local economies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May, home prices in Austin and Houston also hit new highs, according to data from Lender Processing Services, which tracks prices in 1,900 counties nationwide. Other large metropolitan areas that were within 5% of their pre-housing bust peaks in May include San Jose; Honolulu; San Antonio; Nashville; and Kansas City, Mo., LPS data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Many of those cities have industries that are doing well," says Bernard Baumohl, chief economist with the Economic Outlook Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">San Jose is a technology center, as is Austin. Many of the Texas cities have strong energy industries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a year-over-year basis, San Francisco home prices were up the most, 24.5%, the Case-Shiller report shows. It was followed by Las Vegas, up 23.3%, and Phoenix, up 20.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a monthly basis, and when adjusted for seasonal factors, home prices for the 20-city index rose 1% in May from April, Case- Shiller said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's still a strong gain, but it was also the weakest monthly price gain in five months. That should reduce worries about a potential housing bubble, says Jed Kolko, economist for real estate website <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The housing market is clearly on the road to recovery, but there's still a long way to go," he says, noting that foreclosure and loan delinquency rates are still elevated, and home construction remains far from normal levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices are likely to rise more slowly in the next year than they did in the last one, Baumohl says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's because mortgage interest rates have moved higher since late spring, averaging 4.3% for a 30-year fixed mortgage loan for the week ended July 25, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rates could climb into the 5% to 6% range by next year, Baumohl says. Also, home prices are rising much faster than incomes, and that'll eventually limit the number of people who can afford to buy, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of homes for sale has also started to expand. In June, the supply of existing homes for sale edged up slightly to 5.2 months, from 5.0 months in May, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason that inventory is so tight is almost a fifth of homeowners with mortgages remain underwater. They can't easily sell their homes because they owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As prices rise, economists expect more sellers, which could also weigh on home price gains.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the stock market does take cues from incoming economic data, this week provides a window into how investors view the economy's health.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors will be inundated with fresh data this week, with 33 indicators on the docket, according to Bespoke Investment Group. Corporate earnings will keep flowing in, and the Federal Reserve also ends a two-day meeting Wednesday, which could offer clues as to the fate of its market-friendly bond-buying program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The week ahead will be a very busy one for investors, particularly as they try to reassess the direction of the U.S. economy," David Kelly, chief global strategist at <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan</span> Funds, told clients in a research note titled A New Look at U.S. Growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The week kicked off Monday with June pending home sales, which fell 0.4%, but still better than the 1% drop economists expected. The negative reading doesn't change the view that housing remains in recovery mode despite rising interest rates, says Cooper Howes of <span class="companylink">Barclays</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest potential market-moving releases come Wednesday, with the first reading on second-quarter economic growth, or GDP; Friday's jobs report will provide data on the number of jobs created in July and the unemployment rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also this week: Tuesday, readings on July consumer confidence and May home prices are released. Wednesday brings ADP's reading on private job creation in July. Thursday, investors will digest the latest readings on first-time unemployment claims and July manufacturing.</p>

</div><div class="author">Tim Mullaney   </div><div>Tim Mullaney, @TimMullaney, USA TODAY</div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home sales in June hit their highest level in more than five years, a sign of the housing market's strength in the face of recent increases in mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said sales rose 8.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 497,000, the best pace since May 2008. May's sales rate was revised lower to 459,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The jump in new home sales is great news, but whether it was due to growing demand or fears of even higher mortgage rates is not clear," said Joel Naroff, chief economist of Naroff Economic Advisors. It's too early to say that higher rates will not slow the housing market, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People who had been thinking about buying may have moved faster as rates rose in June, boosting last month's sales as they tried to beat further rate increases. Now rates appear to have stabilized, and that may keep some potential buyers from making a purchase, leading to softer demand in the future, Naroff said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of new homes remains tight. At last month's pace, inventory would sell out in 3.9 months. A six-month supply is considered normal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tight supplies are contributing to higher prices, one reason that U.S. home builders are growing increasingly confident about their business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price of new homes sold last month was $249,700, up 7.4% from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo builder sentiment index hit 57 this month from 51 in June. That was the third-consecutive monthly gain. A reading above 50 indicates more builders view sales conditions as good, rather than poor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, existing home sales fell by about 1% in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.08 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> reported on Monday. The annualized sales pace for January through June is about 5 million, the strongest first half since 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average fixed rate on a typical 30-year mortgage was 4.58% for the week ended July 19, down from 4.68% the week before, the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span> said Wednesday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two months after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke roiled the housing market in congressional testimony that included the first clues of rising interest rates, the impact seems to be real -- but still small.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales fell 1.2% in June, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Monday, in a report that mostly reflected deals that were made before rates began to rise in late May. Most other statistics indicate rising rates have had only a small effect on prospects for home buying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, from economic-forecasting firms such as <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics to big real-estate brokers such as Coldwell Banker and Century 21 parent company <span class="companylink">Realogy</span>, the housing market's condition is steady to rising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Realogy</span>, the nation's largest broker, said last week that its transaction volume rose 21% in the second quarter from 2012 levels and will be up 15% to 20% in the second half of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"My company had the best June for purchase-money mortgages that it has had in its 15 years we've been open," said David Vugheri, executive vice president of Houston-based Envoy Mortgage, which does business in 48 states. "Phoenix feels like the heyday. There is no hesitation and no shortage of buyers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, there was a 1% increase in applications for mortgages tied to home sales the week of July 12, according to the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span>. During mid-June, when rates were surging, the association's index for purchase-related applications rose 5% from week to week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But confidence is holding firm, as fixed 30-year mortgage rates have dipped to 4.37%, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, after rising more than a percentage point between mid-May and late June, said David Crowe, chief economist of the National Association of Home Builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders' confidence rose 6 points this month, to 57 on a 100- point scale, in an association survey, Crowe said. The confidence index dipped below 10 during the housing bust. July's climb reflected both higher traffic at new home developments and better expectations about future sales, he said. "The comments on the survey all say there are more buyers and the buyers who are there are more serious," Crowe said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason is that interest rates are still 2 percentage points below their post-World War II average of 6.5%, Fannie Mae chief economist Doug Duncan said. Surveys show the percentage of sellers who think it's a good time to sell is still rising, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seller shortages are bigger problems for some buyers than rates. Low inventories have slowed down Keith and Elizabeth Leavitt, who want to trade up from a 2,400-square-foot townhouse in Manchester- by-the-Sea, Mass. They have a buyer for their current home and are ready to move but can't find the house they need, Elizabeth Leavitt said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People realize the value is there," since rates are still low and prices have dropped, she said. "I thought there would be more for sale."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rock-bottom interest rates make buying a dream home more than just a dream. The reason is simple math: The lower the mortgage rate, the cheaper the monthly payment, which boosts the chances of getting approved for a home loan and being able to buy a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's why the jump in rates has housing bulls on edge. Before mortgage rates rose a full percentage point due to fears the Federal Reserve would stop buying mortgage-backed bonds and U.S. Treasuries, the housing stats screamed "Buy now!" April home prices jumped 12% vs. a year ago, the S&amp;P Case-Shiller home price index found. Signed contracts for pending sales in May rose to their highest level since late 2006. In June, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>' housing index hit a post-recession high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But recent data has been less robust. Last week, June housing starts fell 9.9%. Monday, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> reported that existing home sales fell 1.2% in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's why today's reading from the NAHB, Wednesday's June new- home sales number, and earnings reports on Thursday from home builders Pulte and <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton</span>, are so important, says Eric Wiegand, senior portfolio manager at U.S. Bank wealth management. "Investors will be anxious to see the impact of rising mortgage rates" on home buyers, says Wiegand. But he thinks rates for a 30-year fixed, which the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span> says hit 4.68% last week, are still low enough to keep the recovery going.</p>

</div><div class="author">Julie Schmit   </div><div>Julie Schmit, @JulieSchmit, USA TODAY</div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House flippers are racing against rising prices to make fast profits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first half of this year, 9% of the single-family homes that sold were resold again within six months -- meaning "flipped," according to market researcher RealtyTrac.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some markets are already seeing flippers recede following sharp gains in home prices. Flipping declined in the first half of this year vs. last in 32 of 100 markets, including in cities that have seen rapid price gains, such as Las Vegas, Phoenix, Atlanta and San Jose, RealtyTrac says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, flipping is increasing in markets with more muted home price gains, including New York, Washington, D.C., Chicago and in several Florida cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Palm Coast, Fla., led the way, where 37% of single-family home sales were flipped in the first half of this year. Omaha followed at 32%, and Daytona Beach, Fla., at 16%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The flippers try to catch the wave at the bottom," says Daren Blomquist, RealtyTrac vice president. About 8% of sold single- family homes were flipped last year, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flippers were partially blamed for inflating the housing bubble before the market crashed in 2006. That could happen again in some markets, says John Burns, CEO of John Burns Real Estate Consulting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He hopes that rising interest rates will cool price gains and flipper interest. The average 30-year fixed rate was 4.37% this week, up from 3.5% a year ago, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, flippers often pay cash for homes in such bad shape that banks won't lend on them, says Mark Goldman, real estate expert at San Diego State University. He's invested in three flips this year. Flippers don't inflate prices, he says, they "improve housing inventory."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strong price gains in San Diego, combined with tight inventories, have made flipping less profitable, Goldman says. Instead of the 20% profits seen two years ago, 10% is now more the norm, he estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More of today's flippers are also professionals who understand the cost of renovations, says Budge Huskey, CEO of <span class="companylink">Coldwell Banker Real Estate</span>. Before the housing bubble popped, many flippers were first-timers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The RealtyTrac data show flippers stepping up activity in cities that haven't seen extremely rapid price gains, such as in New York. In the first half of this year, about 5,000 single-family homes were flipped in the New York market, up 437% from last year's level, RealtyTrac data show. Jacksonville posted a 260% jump, and Orlando, a 75% bump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, flippers did 41% fewer deals in Las Vegas during that time frame year-over-year, and 35% fewer in Phoenix. Both cities have had strong home price gains in the past year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house needed work -- weatherproofing, a new back fence, a basement to transform into a bedroom -- but the couple were excited nonetheless. The house would have been their first.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, two weeks after putting in a bid, Mila Gates, 27, and her husband, Jon, 26, backed out when they realized that Mila, who works as the head of social media for a marketing agency, would have had to take a second job to cover the $1,650-a-month mortgage payment. The house was listed for $205,000, but the couple put in a bid for $212,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was at the beginning of May. They continue to rent a two- bedroom apartment in Lakewood, Colo., for $1,000 a month. They'll put off homeownership for two years, Mila says, while they put money saved for a down payment toward their combined $48,000 in student loan debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite saving enough for a down payment, the Gateses found themselves facing many of the obstacles that have plagued the growth of the housing industry in recent years, especially where young, first-time buyers are concerned: low inventory; competing bidders who can pay cash; and struggling to figure out how to cover both a mortgage and student loan payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing crisis is arguably no longer in crisis mode -- home prices and housing sales have both been on the rise in the past year, and record-low interest rates have encouraged people to return to the market. But younger buyers have been left out of the recovery more than any other age group, a USA TODAY analysis shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2006, 25- to 34-year-olds experienced the largest decline in homeownership rates in the country, according to a USA TODAY analysis of Census Bureau data. The homeownership rate declined 7 percentage points for this age group from 2006 to 2011, going from 46.7% to 39.7%. By comparison, the national homeownership rate for all ages declined 2.7 percentage points, from 67.3% owning a home to 64.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A confluence of financial burdens, combined with a bleak economic climate and plunging home prices that real estate experts say depleted confidence in investing in a house, have kept many young adults from entering the market. Meanwhile, they continue to rent or live with their parents, data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among households headed by 25- to 34-year-olds, renters increased by more than a million from 2006 to 2011, while the number who own declined by nearly 1.4 million, according to USA TODAY's analysis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate agents, young buyers, and industry researchers cite depleted confidence, high unemployment, student loan debt, poor credit, low inventory, competition with investors and stricter qualification standards as reasons for the decline in homeownership among those ages 25 to 34.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's been no situation as devastating as this, and it's probably taken a greater toll on the younger generation," says Budge Huskey, CEO of residential brokerage Coldwell Banker. "They've seen other friends or acquaintances that may have even gone through a foreclosure. There's a psychological aspect of the impact of the recession that goes beyond the mere finances."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time buyers -- the median age of which was 31 in 2012, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> -- are considered critical to the housing market, stimulating new-home construction, retail spending and the ability of older Americans to purchase their next homes. Without them, Baby Boomers may find it more difficult to cash in on their homes, and they could suffer long term when it comes to building up their own savings, says Chris Herbert, research director for the Joint Center for Housing Studies of <span class="companylink">Harvard University</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Giving people the opportunity to buy a home is a way to provide them a vehicle of accumulating wealth," he says. "Making sure this next generation has this opportunity will be important for their well-being."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices, sales on the upswing</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has experienced a boost in the past year, as home prices and new- and existing-home sales have gone up. New- home sales were up nearly 20% in 2012 from 2011; existing-home sales were up 9.4%, according to NAR data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in May, first-time buyers accounted for 28% of existing-home purchases, down from 34% a year ago and 36% two years ago, the NAR says. The annual State of the Nation's Housing report put out by Harvard's housing studies center last month shows that the inventory of homes for sale is near record lows this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lack of inventory of the more affordable houses that first- time buyers are often looking for is an even bigger problem, Huskey says. While there's an average of five months worth of inventory on the market right now, according to the NAR, that drops to two to four weeks worth of inventory for median-price homes in many markets, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Gates found themselves up against this problem when they started touring homes in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There was nothing," Mila says. "It was awful. We'd usually see one or two houses at a time, and by the time we finished touring, there'd be a contract on it from someone else."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local real estate agents say one of the biggest factors keeping young people from becoming homeowners is tighter lending standards. For a generation saddled with more debt than any before it, especially in the form of student loans, and dealing with high unemployment and underemployment in recent years, this has proved particularly crippling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soon, young people may have another reason to be wary about entering the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke made comments last month alluding to the central bank tapering its bond-buying program if the economy continues to improve, housing stocks have been in flux, and mortgage rates rose nearly a percentage point from a year ago, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bernanke's remarks Wednesday, however, left the door open to continued low rates if the economy doesn't grow at a satisfactory pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Rising rates are going to hurt affordability," says Len Kiefer, deputy chief economist for <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. He adds that it will especially affect "borrowers on the edge, and that will typically be younger households, households with less savings."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Depends on where you are</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some areas have suffered a greater decline in the homeownership rate of those ages 25 to 34 than others. The New Orleans metro-area rate declined 20.1 percentage points, according to USA TODAY's analysis, though its decline was likely harsher than most due to the effects of Hurricane Katrina, real estate agents there say. Palm Bay, Fla., and Deltona, Fla., metro areas were down 15.3 percentage points and 14.4 percentage points, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since starting to look for a house in New Orleans in February, Natalie Miller and her boyfriend, Peyton Juneau, both 29, have placed bids on three homes that each went to a bidder who paid cash. Owners of two other houses they put offers on never got back to them. They won a fourth bid last week, but only by bidding about 30% more than the home's asking price, Miller says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some major cities that have become popular destinations for recent college graduates could be experiencing a decline in homeownership because it's not a priority for the young adults that flock to them, says Elizabeth Blakeslee, a Coldwell Banker Realtor in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have a very strong urban lifestyle desire," she says of the D.C. area, where she says young people are placing more importance on a rental property's convenience and proximity to the city. The D.C. metro area homeownership rate among 25- to 34-year-olds declined 10.8 percentage points between 2006 and 2011, from 46.6% to 35.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blakeslee hopes D.C.'s predicament will change as twentysomethings get closer to their 30s. Housing experts insist the desire to become a homeowner hasn't dwindled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What we haven't seen is a fundamental shift in the long-term desire to become homeowners," Herbert says. "But we have seen both a declining ability, as well as the willingness to make that leap in the last few years."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nation's economy continued to grow at a modest to moderate pace in the past six weeks, with a strengthening real estate market offsetting tepid gains in retail and manufacturing, according to a Federal Reserve report Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed's beige book was largely similar to its previous report in early June. That report portrayed an economy that continues to expand on strong sales of houses and cars but has been slowed by federal budget cuts and tax increases for working Americans. The Fed's report Wednesday says hiring is picking up "at a measured pace," with some employers hesitant to bring on permanent or full- time workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturing expanded in most of the Fed's 12 bank districts, though storms led to a "slight contraction" in the Kansas City region. The growth was moderate in Chicago, Cleveland and St. Louis, but modest in Boston, New York, Atlanta and San Francisco, the Fed said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential construction continued to drive much of the gains as wood product makers stepped up production in the St. Louis and San Francisco areas. A cement producer in Dallas reported brisk activity, while demand for construction equipment picked up in the Chicago area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Auto manufacturing also fueled gains in Chicago, St. Louis and Minneapolis, spurring more steel and metal production across several regions. But semiconductor orders in Dallas were "mixed," sales activity dipped for electronic equipment firms in Philadelphia, and food producers faced falling demand in Philadelphia and Kansas City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer spending and tourism picked up across much of the country, though retailers in New York, Cleveland, Atlanta and St. Louis said sales were disappointing. Stores in the Boston and San Francisco areas posted strong demand for technology products. Auto sales were also a bright spot in many areas, as consumers continue to replace aging vehicles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shining star of the recovery lately remains the housing market, with most areas reporting brisker home sales and rising prices. Home inventories dwindled further in several areas, including Boston, New York, Atlanta, Richmond, Minneapolis and Dallas. The trend is accompanied by a greater willingness by lenders to provide mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those in the Cleveland, Chicago and Dallas areas said "competitive pressures" led them to lower interest rates. A "shift toward new home mortgages and away from refinancing" was reported in the Richmond, Cleveland, Atlanta and Chicago areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commercial real estate also continued to accelerate gradually in much of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite job growth of about 200,000 a month so far this year, the Fed's beige book underscores a reluctance by many employers to hire full-time workers, especially in the Philadelphia, Richmond and Chicago areas. Economists have partly blamed the new health care law, which requires firms with more than 50 employees to provide health insurance to full-time workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some sectors are booming. New York, Richmond and San Francisco reported high demand for technology workers.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Major real estate investors are continuing to expand into more cities as they look for single-family homes to buy and turn into rentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April, institutional investors bought 10% of the houses sold in the nation's 100 busiest real estate markets, up from 5% the year before, says real estate tracker Radar Logic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase underscores how important investors such as Wall Street investment funds are to the national housing recovery. Their appetite for homes has helped drive prices up faster than many real estate forecasters expected even a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Radar Logic's analysis of activity in the top 100 metros for housing defined institutional investors as corporations, investment trusts or partnerships. Its findings:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 35 metro areas, institutional investors' share of housing sales was 10% or more in April. Sales included single-family homes, condominiums and one- to four-unit apartment buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lakeland, Fla., led, with 29% of sales to such investors, followed by Las Vegas and Miami, at 22% each.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cities with more than 16% of home sales to investors included Memphis, Atlanta, Charlotte and Bakersfield, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several North Carolina cities posted hefty year-over-year increases in institutional investor purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charlotte led with a more than 800% increase, followed by Raleigh and Greensboro, at 320% and 141%, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big investors have poured more than $10 billion into the single- family home rental market in recent years, estimates <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest, the <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group</span>, has bought 29,000 homes in 13 markets -- 25,000 of them in the past year, it says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the big investors generally bought first in Phoenix and parts of California, which were hit hard by the foreclosure crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As prices have soared in many of those markets, investors have expanded into other cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">San Francisco-based Landsmith, for instance, has acquired 1,000 homes in the past six months. The latest ones include some in Houston; Charlotte and Raleigh, N.C.; Nashville; Indianapolis; and Columbus, Ohio, says CEO James Breitenstein.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those markets generally haven't seen the price gains of many California and Florida markets so the rental returns are still good, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Colony American Homes</span>, which has invested $2 billion and owns almost 14,000 homes in seven states, is about to enter the Carolinas, says CEO Justin Chang.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It bought first in California, Arizona and Nevada, then expanded into Texas, Georgia, Florida and Colorado.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This opportunity was never just about a few markets," Chang says. "There are good values and a lot of demand from families to rent."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home prices have risen for 14 straight months, but first- time buyers have been increasingly on the sidelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May, first-time buyers accounted for 28% of existing-home purchases, down from 34% a year before and 36% two years ago, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The declining share of first timers means that many have missed out on low interest rates -- which recently moved up from near- record lows -- and home prices that have risen sharply from their bottom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The people buying homes today are participating in home price growth. Younger people, they are being left out," says Lawrence Yun, chief economist of the NAR. "It remains to be seen when the first- time buyer can return."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time buyers are critical to a housing recovery because they help existing-home owners sell and move up to larger or more expensive homes. But their presence is being reduced by:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Competition. Cash buyers accounted for 33% of existing home sales in May. Investors, who are often all-cash buyers, accounted for 18% of purchases, the NAR says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cash buyers are tough competitors, especially in markets with limited inventory and for first-time buyers who often use low down- payment loans to finance purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first-time buyer "is being squeezed out of the market a lot," says Zillow economist Svenja Gudell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are also more repeat buyers in the market, given that higher home prices have enabled more people to sell homes and buy others, says Glenn Kelman, CEO of brokerage Redfin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tight credit. Home loans are harder to get than before the housing bust, and that's true for first-time buyers, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost half of first-timers get low down-payment loans through the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span>, NAR data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New FHA home loans in the last three months of 2012 went to borrowers with an average credit score of 696, vs. under 660 in 2007 and 2008, FHA data show. Credit scores, which run up to 850, for conventional loans have also risen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recession. It hit the 25- to 34-year-old group with higher unemployment than for adults overall, says Jed Kolko, <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Young people have made a strong recovery, but it takes years of steady employment to save a down payment and build strong credit, he says. High levels of student debt will also delay homeownership, Kolko says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Increases in home prices and mortgage rates since last year have made a big difference in costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May, the median value of the bottom third of homes in San Francisco was $287,500, Zillow says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With today's 4.4% interest rate and 20% down, the mortgage payment runs $1,154 -- $313 more than at last year's prices and rates, its data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You're getting a double whammy with higher prices and rates," says Ashley Krause, 31, of Boston, who's been trying to buy her first home for six months with a down payment of 5% or less.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors wondering how higher interest rates might affect the economy and stock market are using home builders' stocks as their observation deck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of home builders, one of the most powerful winners on the stock market coming into the year, have been smacked with a wrecking ball as the Federal Reserve's comments have investors fretting about higher interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The SPDR S&amp;P Homebuilders exchange traded fund, which contains shares of the largest home builders, is one of the most important industries to fall nearly 10% from its recent high on May 15, putting it dangerously close to correction territory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The market is telling us the higher interest rates matter," says Brett Kornfeld, managing director at research firm Discern.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The stock market takes into consideration longer-term issues."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fate of home-building stocks holds critical clues not just for investors in the stocks, but for investors wondering about the direction of the stock market. The housing recovery has been one of the key parts of the stock market and economy's stabilization. But home-building stocks may be one of the first areas to indicate whether the economy is strong enough to hold up on its own power, rather than relying on Fed-powered low interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors will be watching home-building stocks for key elements, including the:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Extent of stock losses for home builders. Home builders have been pulled into a sell-off that's hurting many stocks sensitive to higher rates, including real estate investment trusts and utilities, says Peter Martin of <span class="companylink">JMP Securities</span>. But so far, home-builder investors are adjusting to the reality that the Fed is no longer bound to hold interest rates low. In the past weeks, the rate on a typical 30-year fixed mortgage has moved from 3.5% to closer to 4.5%, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question is if home-builder stocks will fall further, pushing valuations to where they were when mortgage rates jumped in 1993 and 1994, Martin says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Slowdown in the price appreciation of homes. Demand is strong as home builders build homes more slowly than households are growing and low interest rates help with affordability. Home prices jumped a record 12.1% in the year ended in April, roundly beating many analysts' expectations, based on the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case-Shiller index released last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But those gains aren't sustainable, given the current state of job creation, and are likely to moderate, Martin says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Timing of a downturn in housing demand. The risk of higher mortgage rates pushes buyers who were close to making a home purchase to act now. But the jump in rates from 3.5% to 4.5% means 11% higher payments, which could hurt demand, Martin says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of these factors can be looked at in isolation, says Megan McGrath of <span class="companylink">MKM Partners</span>. If higher interest rates come with better job and income growth, the housing recovery can continue, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without those, it's more troubling, Martin says. "You need other things like that to work out, too," Martin says.</p>

</div><div class="author">Julie Schmit   </div><div>Julie Schmit, @JulieSchmit, USA TODAY</div>
<div>612 words</div><div>28 June 2013</div><div>USA Today (Newspaper)</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.1</div><div>English</div><div>© 2013 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week's sharp increase in mortgage rates -- the biggest one- week leap in 26 years -- won't likely be repeated, but a long era of historically low rates may be over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage giant <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> said Thursday that the average 30- year fixed-rate mortgage rose to 4.46%, the highest in almost two years, and up from under 4% the week before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the short run, this week's half a percentage point increase could push some home shoppers out of the market while spurring others to act before rates go higher, says John Burns, CEO of John Burns Real Estate Consulting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long term, higher rates and more homes for sale could slow price gains, whose rapid rise has spurred fears of another housing bubble. In April, home prices were up 12.1% from a year ago and more than 20% in San Francisco, Phoenix, Las Vegas and Atlanta, <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case-Shiller data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher interest rates will have a "small impact" on sales as well as prices, says Cameron Findlay, economist with Discover Home Loans. Gains of 20% year-over-year "are not sustainable or healthy," he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher rates won't stop the housing market recovery, however, says <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> economist Frank Nothaft. It has "enough momentum to continue," but sales volume and home price growth will be "less than what would've occurred," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nothaft expects rates to bounce between 4 3/8% and 4 5/8% through the end of the year. "The historic trough is history," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The impact of the increase is already being observed in some places.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New customer volume was down 11% last weekend from the average of the previous three weekends at real estate brokerage Redfin, says CEO Glenn Kelman. Meanwhile, shoppers further along in the process rushed to close deals. "We've had people calling us in tears. There were so many buyers at the outer limit of what they could afford," Kelman says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increases follow rising yields on the 10-year Treasury bond. They've climbed in the wake of Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's comments last week that the Fed could start trimming its stimulus policies later this year. Mortgage rates track the 10-year Treasury rate, which is at a two-year high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Diggle of Capital Economics expects 30-year rates of 4% at year end, 5% next year and 5% in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average rates have been below 4% since late 2011, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> data show. But they're still low, having averaged 8.6% since 1971, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> says. At today's prices and income levels, mortgage rates would have to be nearly 7% before the U.S. median-priced home would be unaffordable to a family making the median income in most parts of the country, a <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> analysis shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher rates will have the most impact on affordability in high- cost areas, such as San Francisco to San Diego and Washington, D.C., to Boston, as well as in Seattle and Miami, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">40 years of lows, highs</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average rate for a fixed, 30-year mortgage hit a two-year high this week, but it's still low relative to yearly averages from the past three decades:</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a data-dependent investment world, markets move on incoming economic numbers. The question for investors: Is good news or bad news better for stocks?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It might seem counter-intuitive to think lousy economic news could cause cheers on trading floors and stocks to rally. But that's been the winning trade for a few years. The reason: The lousier the incoming data, the longer the Federal Reserve keeps its market- friendly stimulus policies in place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Fed threw a wrench in that trade last week when Chairman Ben Bernanke said it will start dialing back its bond-buying program, dubbed QE, later this year. The catch? Bernanke said any pullback in stimulus would be dependent on the economy continuing to show life and demonstrating that it can stand on its own two feet without the Fed's help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That new information injected a new trade into the equation: Good economic news is good for stocks, as it reduces fears that the economy will relapse despite tighter Fed policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's confusing is the "good news is good news" trade worked wonders on Tuesday, when the Dow rose 101 points on better-than- expected readings on durable goods, home prices, new home sales and consumer confidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Wednesday, the "bad news is good news" trade returned when the Dow surged 150 points, although the government said first- quarter growth was at 1.8%, below an earlier estimate of 2.4%. Something's got to give. Wall Street can't have it both ways.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home sales surged in May, and home prices soared in April, but rising mortgage rates threaten future gains, economists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices rose a record 12.1% in the year ending in April, according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case-Shiller index released Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home sales, meanwhile, reached their highest level in nearly five years. Sales rose 2.1% in May from April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 476,000, the Census Bureau said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller data measure home prices from sales that happened before interest rates began to climb in early May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of mid-June, rates averaged 4.17% for a 30-year-fixed rate loan for balances less than $417,500. That was up from 3.59% in early May. New figures are expected today from the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While rates have gone up, some banks have also eased credit restrictions, which should keep housing's recovery intact, says David Blitzer, chairman of the S&amp;P index committee. Home buyers have survived rising mortgage rates in the past, he says, often by shifting from fixed-rate to adjustable-rate loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher rates could be spurring some to buy before rates go higher, says Stew Larsen, executive vice president of <span class="companylink">Bank of the West</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, if 30-year-fixed rates remain above 4.5% -- as they were Monday, based on a survey by mortgage tracker HSH.com -- some buyers will be priced out of the home market, says Keith Gumbinger, HSH.com vice president. "If rates hold at these levels, there definitely will be an impact on home sales," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home price gains will certainly be affected by higher interest rates, says Stan Humphries, chief economist of Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising rates, along with an increasing supply of homes for sale, will "help mitigate extreme price spikes caused by very strong housing demand and very low housing supply," Humphries says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Year-over-year, all 20 cities in the Case-Shiller index showed positive gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">San Francisco led the way with prices up almost 24% year-over- year. Las Vegas prices increased more than 22%. Phoenix prices rose almost 22%, and Atlanta prices were up almost 21%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York saw the smallest year-over-year gain of 3.2%, followed by Cleveland at 4.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with March, the Case-Shiller data showed April home prices up 2.5% for the 20-city composite. All cities except Detroit posted gains. Its April prices were flat with March.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Many economists back Fed ; Poll: Stimulus move is not a death blow</span>

<div>542 words</div><div>24 June 2013</div><div>USA Today (Newspaper)</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.1</div><div>English</div><div>© 2013 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most economists surveyed by USA TODAY say economic growth will not be slowed by the Federal Reserve's market-rattling announcement that it will likely rein in its extraordinary stimulus this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well over half of the economists surveyed said growth will not be reduced if the Fed begins to pare back its $85 billion in monthly government bond purchases later this year, then ends them by mid- 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's the road map outlined by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke at a news conference after a Fed meeting Wednesday, assuming the economy and labor market continue to improve and the 7.6% unemployment rate falls to 7% by the middle of next year. The survey of 41 economists was conducted June 21.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bernanke's remarks set off a 550-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average Wednesday and Thursday -- its biggest two-day decline in 19 months. Yields on 10-year Treasury bonds, which influence interest rates broadly for consumers and businesses, have risen from 2.18% to 2.54%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financial markets worried that the economy isn't strong enough to withstand the withdrawal of the Fed's stimulus, which has held down interest rates, buoying the stock market and home sales since last fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But three out of four economists surveyed said their economic outlook supports the Fed's tentative blueprint for phasing out the bond purchases. The economists expect unemployment to fall to 7.3% by December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The U.S. economy will learn how to function without (the Fed's) crutches," says Bernard Baumohl, chief economist of the Economic Outlook Group. He noted that the share of income Americans are using to pay off debt has fallen to a 30-year low, corporations are sitting on near-record cash reserves, and credit conditions have eased. The stock market's plunge last week, he says, "does not reflect economic fundamentals. We will likely see some sanity come back (to the markets) in coming days."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Baumohl says a further rate rise should be anticipated as the Fed pulls back its stimulus. He expects 10-year Treasuries to approach 3% by the end of the year. And 30-year mortgage rates could climb from 3.93% to 4.25% by December, economists' median estimate shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Baumohl says that's still cheap money by historical standards, and other forces will continue to propel the housing market. He believes, however, that Bernanke unnecessarily shook markets by disclosing too much about tentative plans too soon, noting that economic reports are not indicating strong growth. According to economists' median estimate, they expect the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 to rise 3.2% the rest of the year to 1643, but that's below Tuesday's close of 1651.81, before Bernanke's remarks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">UBS</span> economist Maury Harris disagrees, saying Bernanke needed to acclimate investors. "There was no way to candy-coat it," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors is among the 15 economists who believe Bernanke went too far, and the economy isn't yet strong enough. "I think he's blowing it," Naroff says.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big jump in home prices in the past year is finally bringing more sellers to the housing market, but inventories remain lean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of existing homes for sale ticked up to 2.2 million in May, up 3.3% from April, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When adjusted for seasonal factors, inventory has risen for four months in a row, suggesting the supply bottom came in January, says Jed Kolko, economist for real estate website <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new sellers are making moves they've put off for years as home prices tanked. They're taking jobs in other locations, enjoying fast sales of existing homes. And some are pricing properties at levels higher than Realtors think prudent -- and getting their price anyway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new sellers hardly constitute a flood, more like a trickle from a huge lake. They still are far too few for the balance of power in many markets to shift from sellers to buyers, says Budge Huskey, CEO of Coldwell Banker. But with home prices up 12% in April from a year ago, more are expected if prices continue to rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is huge pent-up seller demand," Huskey says. "Every Realtor knows a seller who'd like to move to the next chapter in their life."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Martha Gove and Josh Cohen are doing just that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They're moving just three blocks from their current home in Ann Arbor, Mich., to a bigger home they just bought.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple were "waiting and watching" for three years to find a suitable home for sale. In recent months, "things finally started to loosen up," says Gove, 40, a lawyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May, Ann Arbor posted an 11% jump in homes listed for sale from April, Realtor.com says -- almost twice as much as the national average. And its May asking prices tracked by Realtor.com were up 17% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ann Arbor's market is so strong that the couple are attempting to sell their home themselves. That's not something they would have attempted even six months ago, Gove says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first week after listing their home, they had six showings. "People are suddenly on the move," Gove says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May, existing home sales nationwide were up a robust 4.2% from April and almost 13% from a year ago, NAR says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SUPPLY IMPROVING BUT TIGHT</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shift in supply is broad-based.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this month, the number of homes listed for sale on real estate website Zillow was down 12.2% year-over-year. That's still better than in January, when listings were down almost 18% year- over-year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data from brokerage Redfin, which tracks listings in 19 major markets, including Los Angeles, Chicago and Philadelphia, shows listings down 22% in May from a year ago. That's also better than the 32% year-over-year drop in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Realtor.com, which tracks listings in 146 markets nationwide, shows listings up 5.8% in May from April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in 18 of the markets, including Los Angeles, Orlando and Seattle, inventory was up 10% or more in May from April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the California cities of Stockton and Sacramento, May listings were up more than 35% from April. Both cities posted 22% price gains in April from a year earlier, market researcher <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising home prices are likely driving the increase, Kolko says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Every day as prices rise, more people get back above water," Kolko says. That makes selling easier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, 9.7 million, or almost 20% of homeowners with a mortgage, owed more on their homes than they were worth as of March, <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> says. That's down from 12.1 million at the end of 2011, just as home price gains were kicking off in many markets after a roughly 30% national drop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Sellers have finally noticed that they have some equity," says Coldwell Banker agent Ramon Macias in San Diego. Prices there were up 17% in April year-over-year, <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gonzalo and Grace Hernandez never worried about whether they'd get back what they paid for their San Diego home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's because they bought it just 11 months ago when prices were starting to move off their bottom. They're now selling it to relocate to Nashville for a job change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They paid $355,000 for the home and now have it under contract to sell for $420,000. It took a week to sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, the median time on market for all homes that sold in May was just 41 days. That's down from 72 days a year ago, NAR says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Knowing that they'd turn a solid profit was a "big part of the decision" to accept a job transfer with his hotel chain employer, says Gonzalo Hernandez, 40.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some sellers are getting prices that surprise even their Realtors, given tight supplies for sale in some markets and frequent multiple-offer situations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Redfin agent Bree Al-Rashid recently handled the sale of a home in a popular Seattle neighborhood that sold for 10% more than she thought it was worth, based on comparable sales. The sellers were adamant that the listing price be higher than what she recommended, Al-Rashid says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I've been humbled in this market. We cannot predict what can happen," Al-Rashid says. Seattle prices were up 16% in April from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of existing homes for sale in May was at 5.1 months, down from 5.2 months in April. But the supply was just 4.3 months in January, NAR data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That means that all homes would sell in that time frame if no more supply came on the market and sales continued at May's pace. Generally, Realtors consider a six-month supply to be a balanced market between buyers and sellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction in play</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will be next year before the supply of existing homes for sale climbs to a six- or seven-month level, says Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One big factor is how fast home builders ramp up construction, which will increase the overall supply of homes for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, sellers still have big advantages in many markets, especially in the West where inventory tends to be tighter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In California, May's data show just a 2.6-month supply of single- family homes for sale -- leaving that market firmly in the sellers' camp after years of rampant foreclosures and big price drops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's amazing how quickly the dynamics have changed from a buyer's market to a seller's market," Huskey says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks repossessed 11% more homes in May than in April, potentially a sign that they, too, want to unload homes in a strong market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bank repossessions increased in 33 states, with some seeing a big jump, market researcher RealtyTrac reports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In North Carolina, repossessions were up 60% in May from April. Oregon saw a 57% jump, and Wisconsin and Illinois, a 44% increase, RealtyTrac says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Given the shortage of inventory and rising home prices, banks have little motivation to hold back on any foreclosures," says Craig King, chief operating officer of Chase International brokerage, which covers the Reno market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, foreclosure filings -- which include default notices, scheduled auctions and bank repossessions -- were up 2% in May from the 75-month low in April, RealtyTrac says. Filings were down 28% from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Repossessions, which numbered almost 39,000 in May, are the end of a foreclosure, but foreclosure starts mark the beginning of a process that can take years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May, foreclosure starts nationwide were up 4% from April but down 33% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, 14 states saw foreclosure starts increase from last year. In some of those states, courts or legislatures slowed the foreclosure process to make sure they were done correctly following revelations in 2010 that many weren't. As a result, those states tend to have more distressed homes still in the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New Jersey, foreclosure starts in May were up 82% from a year ago. Nevada starts were up 81% year-over-year. New York starts jumped 13% year-over-year, RealtyTrac says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the jump in activity in some markets, the housing recovery has strengthened most local markets enough to "quickly shake off a few more blows from these nagging foreclosures," says Daren Blomquist, RealtyTrac vice president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, home prices were up 12.1% in April year-over-year, <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tight inventories of homes for sale in many markets are helping to drive the rapid increases, economists and real estate experts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, there are signals that the inventory crunch has bottomed. Nationwide, the number of for-sale listings on Zillow was down 12% as of June 2 from a year ago. But that's less severe than the almost 18% shortfall recorded in January, Zillow says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventory will likely remain below year-ago levels for a while as builders ramp up capacity and sellers wait for even higher prices, says Stan Humphries, Zillow economist. "But a corner has been turned," he says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More Americans say now is a good time to sell a home than at any time in the past three years, a rise in confidence that could lead to more sellers and smaller home price gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May, 40% of Americans said it was a good time to sell a home, up from 30% in April and 16% a year before, according to a survey from mortgage giant <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big jump from March was the largest in the survey's three- year history, and was likely inspired by strong home price gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The jump may also foreshadow a lessening of the inventory crunch of homes for sale that's fueled rapid home price gains in many markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Sentiment toward selling a home appears to be catching up with the strengthening housing market," says Doug Duncan, senior vice president and chief economist at <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home prices jumped 12.1% in April year-over-year, marking the 14th consecutive month of gains, market researcher <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tight inventories of homes for sale have been a big driver of those increases. Now, "higher prices are finally drawing people into the market," says Glenn Kelman, CEO of real estate brokerage Redfin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, the supply of homes for sale in April was up 4% from January, adjusted seasonally, says Jed Kolko, chief economist for real estate site <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>. "More inventory will mean price increases will slow."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some markets have seen far sharper inventory jumps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Orange County, the active inventory this week is up 30% from mid-March, says Steven Thomas of Reports on Housing. The California cities of Stockton and Sacramento both posted more than a 75% jump in total listings in April from the prior month, according to Realtor.com, which tracks more than 140 markets nationwide. Nationally, inventory was up 4% in the same period, Realtor.com says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other markets seeing bigger jumps than 4% included Atlanta and Boston, up 9%, and Austin, up 7%.</p>

<div>530 words</div><div>12 June 2013</div><div>USA Today (Newspaper)</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.1</div><div>English</div><div>© 2013 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demonstrating the power of rising home prices, the number of underwater homeowners has dropped below 10 million for the first time in more than at least three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, 9.7 million, or 19.8% of homeowners with a mortgage, owed more on their homes than they were worth as of March, says market researcher <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's down from 12.1 million at the end of 2011, just as home price gains were kicking off in many markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All told, the nation's negative equity decreased more than $50 billion to $580 billion as of March, down from $631 billion in December, <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising home prices, up 12.1% in April year-over-year, have lifted 1.7 million home loan borrowers above water in the past year, the data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If prices continue to rise, more borrowers will likely list homes for sale. That will moderate price gains in many of the fast- appreciating markets, says Mark Fleming, <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The declining ranks of underwater homeowners are a plus for the economy. Borrowers with equity in their homes are less likely to default on those loans, they're more avid spenders and they're more able to sell homes and move to other locations to pursue job opportunities, says Mark Zandi, chief economist of <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With so many borrowers remaining underwater, "We still have a long way to go but we are making quick progress," Zandi says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As homeowners gain equity in their homes, they can also refinance and take advantage of lower interest rates to reduce their mortgage costs, says Christopher Thornberg, economist at Beacon Economics. Those people then have more money to spend on other things.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of December, 45% of homeowners with mortgages still had loans with interest rates above 5%, <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> data show. The monthly average rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate loan has been below 4% since late 2011, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">States that suffered the biggest run-ups in home price gains -- then fell hard after the housing bubble burst -- still lead in terms of underwater borrowers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of March, Nevada had the highest percentage of mortgaged properties that were underwater, at 45.4%, followed by Florida at 38.1%. Michigan, Arizona and Georgia round out the top five, all over 30%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the end of last year, there's been some change in the top five metropolitan regions with the most underwater borrowers, however.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phoenix, which has led the home price recovery, dropped out of the top five in the first quarter, as did Riverside, Calif. In April, home prices in those cities were up 19.2% and 16.5%, respectively. Both cities were in the top five at the end of 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, Chicago and the Warren-Troy, Mich., area joined Tampa, Miami and Atlanta as the top five underwater metro areas, <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> says. The Tampa area led with 44.1% of mortgaged homes underwater.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everyone knows that low interest rates provide a solid foundation for the housing market. Low borrowing costs make homes more affordable because it lowers the cost of the monthly mortgage, which for most folks is their biggest bill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low mortgage rates in recent years, fueled by the Federal Reserve's monthly purchase of $85 billion of mortgage-backed bonds and 10-year <span class="companylink">U.S. Treasury</span> notes, have been instrumental in the rise in home prices, including a jump of nearly 11% in the past year, according to the March S&amp;P Case-Shiller home price index. Cheap financing is also a big reason why new-home sales in April rose 2.3% to a seasonally adjusted 454,000 homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A big beneficiary of the Fed's bond-buying policy has been stocks in the S&amp;P Homebuilders index. The index has nearly doubled since the end of 2010, but has fallen more than 5% since May 21, the day before the Fed hinted that it might start paring back its bond purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But not even a market-friendly jobs number on Friday, which helped the broad market regain some lost ground, has been able to reduce the pain now being suffered by interest rate-sensitive home builder stocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Monday's trading, all the major U.S. housing stocks, including <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton</span>, <span class="companylink">Toll Bros</span>., Lennar, Pulte Home, <span class="companylink">KB Home</span> and Hovnanian all suffered losses ranging from 1.5% to more than 3%. Those losses came on a day when the broad market was flat. The takeaway: Rate- sensitive stocks may suffer turbulence.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage interest rates have broken the 4% mark for the first time in a year and may eventually cool home price gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rates jumped to 4.07% last week for a 30-year-fixed rate loan, the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span> said Wednesday. That's up from 3.59% from early May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economist Christopher Thornberg of Beacon Economics expects interest rates to settle between 4% and 5% next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher rates have pummeled refinancings, but they probably won't derail the national housing recovery, economists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For home buyers, rates' move will be little more than a "blip," says Jed Kolko, chief economist for real estate website <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>. That's because rates are still low and home prices, while higher, are still far from prior peaks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some buyers may even try to speed up their purchases so they get in before rates go higher, Kolko says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When interest rates go up, it scares people and they get off the fence because they don't want to miss the great interest rates," says John Burns, CEO of John Burns Real Estate Consulting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other rates also have risen as financial markets have reacted to recent Federal Reserve officials' comments on when the Fed might begin to taper its purchases of mortgage-backed securities and Treasury bonds. Those purchases have helped keep interest rates low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond fell slightly to 2.09% Wednesday, but it's still up from 1.67% at the end of April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While not enough to derail the housing market rebound, with prices up 12.1% year-over-year in April, <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> says, the sharp increase in rates could begin to "weigh on home price appreciation," says Michelle Meyer, <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> senior economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's because higher interest rates make homes less affordable. That could be especially an issue in markets where home prices are high, such as in parts of California, Zillow economist Stan Humphries says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest rates tailored for bigger loans, those with balances of more than $417,500, also moved up last week, hitting 4.2%, the MBA says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with higher rates, owning a home is still far cheaper than renting, given home prices and rental costs, Kolko says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of March, the cost of owning would have been 39% cheaper than renting with rates at 4.5% and 33% cheaper with rates at 5.5%, <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It sounds counterintuitive, but there are times when bad economic news is actually pretty good news for stocks. Thursday was a good example of the "bad-news-is-good-news trade." A day after the Dow Jones industrials tumbled 106 points amid fears that robust readings on consumer confidence and home prices would cause interest rates to surge and prod the Federal Reserve to start dialing back on its market-friendly stimulus programs, the Dow eked out a 22-point gain on a slew of worse-than-expected data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, bulls took a trio of weak reports in stride. The second revised estimate of economic growth in the first quarter came in at 2.4%, below the 2.5% expected. Pending home sales in April rose just 0.3%, shy of the predicted 1.5% gain. First-time claims for unemployment benefits rose last week by 10,000, to 354,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So why didn't stocks tank? Because the Federal Reserve has stressed that it is reluctant to start reducing stimulus until the economy is strong enough to sustain its growth without Fed help. The Fed has cited a drop in the unemployment rate to 6.5%, from its current level of 7.5%, as a prerequisite before they stop buying mortgage-backed bonds and long-term Treasury notes. That policy, which is designed to stimulate the economy, has been a boon for stocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signs of a cooling economy raise "hopes the Fed will have to reassess its resolve to pull back on monetary easing measures," notes Karee Venema of Schaeffer's Investment Research.</p>

</div><div class="author">Adam Shell   </div><div>Adam Shell, USA TODAY,</div>
<div>538 words</div><div>29 May 2013</div><div>USA Today (Newspaper)</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>A.1</div><div>English</div><div>© 2013 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dizzying 2013 stock market rally was reignited Tuesday by multiyear highs in home prices and consumer confidence, a sign the bull run reflects a healing economy and not just the Federal Reserve's easy-money policies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones industrial average hit its 25th record high this year, surging 106.29 points, or 0.69%, to 15,409.39. Powering the gains: a 10.9% rise in home prices the 12 months ending in March, the biggest jump in nearly seven years. And May's consumer confidence survey hit its highest level in five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The economic numbers we're seeing are confirming what the U.S. stock market has been telling us all year: The economy is on a stronger footing and improving longer-term," says Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Skeptics of the Dow's run to one record high after another have repeatedly questioned the rally, arguing that the Dow's rise has been artificially inflated by the Fed's 0% interest-rate policy and its bond-buying program, which is designed to keep borrowing rates low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People are having trouble understanding why the market is going up when the economy is growing slowly, jobs are hard to find, and corporate profit growth is slowing, and they are left with the idea that the rally is just a sugar high from the Fed," explains Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at <span class="companylink">Wells Capital Management</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Paulsen has a different, much more bullish take on why the Dow is up 17.6% this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"My take is that rising confidence is driving the stock market higher," says Paulsen, adding that investors now believe the worst- case fears they've harbored since the 2008 financial crisis won't be realized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether the Dow can keep up its white-hot pace is a different story altogether. Although many Wall Street pros expect stocks to be higher at the end of the year than they are now, most say don't bank on gains in the second half of 2013 looking the same as the gains year-to-date.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A nearly 18% gain is a pretty awesome full-year gain and we are not even halfway through this year," says Joseph Tanious, global markets strategist at <span class="companylink">JP Morgan</span> Funds. Is it sustainable? He's not holding his breath.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paulsen, despite his bullishness, expects the market to climb 2% to 3% higher before trading sideways as investors wrestle with the competing forces of stronger economic growth and rising interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bond yields jumped to a 14-month high Tuesday, with the yield on the 10-year <span class="companylink">U.S. Treasury</span> note climbing to 2.17% from 1.63% May 3. Low rates have been a boon for stocks, as investors moved to stocks in hopes of better returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What could derail the rally?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Kvantas, a portfolio manager at USAA Investments, says a weaker-than-expected stream of earnings from corporate America in the second half of the year, caused by government spending cuts and higher taxes, would hurt stocks.</p>

</div><div class="author">Julie Schmit   </div><div>Julie Schmit, @JulieSchmit, USA TODAY</div>
<div>600 words</div><div>29 May 2013</div><div>USA Today (Newspaper)</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.1</div><div>English</div><div>© 2013 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rapid run-up in housing prices the past year has ignited talk of another housing "bubble," but only a few markets are at risk -- so far, experts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home prices rose 10.9% in the 12 months ending in March for their largest annual gain in seven years, according to the latest <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case-Shiller index released Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with that rise, home prices are about 28% off their 2006 peaks, Case-Shiller says. "There's zero case to be made that we're in a housing bubble," says John Burns, CEO of Burns Real Estate Consulting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median U.S. housing prices are normally 3.25 times the median household incomes, based on 25 years of data, Burns says. As of April, national home prices were about 3.2 times median incomes, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some markets are "starting to look bubble-ish," though, namely San Francisco and Orange County, Calif., Burns says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, San Francisco prices were up more than 22% year-over- year, according to Case-Shiller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Historically, median home prices in San Francisco are eight times the median household incomes, Burns says. They're now 10 times larger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orange County prices, as of April, were 7.5 times the median incomes. That compares with the norm of six for that area, Burns says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate website <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> has also dubbed those cities as "overvalued" relative to fundamentals, including housing supply, demand and expectations about the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Six other markets, out of 100 nationwide, also rate as overvalued, <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> says. Those are Austin, San Antonio, Los Angeles, San Jose, Houston and Portland, Ore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a national basis, though, <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> says home prices are still 7% undervalued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In early 2006, right before the collapse of the last housing bubble, prices were as much as 39% overvalued, <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That makes today's price gains a rebound, not a new bubble, <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller data show that all 20 cities in the index showed increases on an annual basis for at least three consecutive months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leading the way in March were Phoenix and San Francisco, up 22% for the year. Las Vegas was up almost 21%. Miami and Tampa were softer, with annual gains of almost 11% and almost 12%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the weakest price gains were "substantial," said David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee. New York was up 2.6%, Cleveland, almost 5%, and Boston, 6.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of home price gains is expected to slow as more inventory becomes available, mortgage interest rates rise and investor buyers slow down purchases, says Jed Kolko, <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>'s chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today's low mortgage rates and tight supply of homes for sale are "creating a kind of witch's brew of extreme price spikes," says Stan Humphries, Zillow chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fast appreciation is not an immediate problem in areas such as Phoenix and Las Vegas, which experienced huge price declines and are still very affordable, he says. But he's also concerned about bubble-like conditions in the San Francisco Bay Area, Orange County and San Diego.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April, the supply of existing homes for sale grew to 5.2 months, up from 4.7 months in March, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That means all the homes would sell in that time frame if no new supply were added. Realtors consider a six-month supply to be a balanced market between buyers and sellers.</p>

</div><div class="author">Julie Schmit   </div><div>Julie Schmit, USA TODAY,</div>
<div>595 words</div><div>28 May 2013</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.1</div><div>English</div><div>© 2013 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in vacation areas are on the upswing with the rest of the housing market but not as much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of May 1, median asking prices per square foot for homes in vacation areas were up 1% from last year vs. a 7% gain for other areas, data pulled from millions of listings on real estate website <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices in vacation areas are rebounding more slowly than prices generally because vacation homes are luxuries, and luxury spending takes more time to recover after a severe recession, says Jed Kolko, Trulia chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Traditionally, we run six months behind" local market trends, says Steve Keefe, broker/owner of Coldwell Banker Sky Ridge Realty in Lake Arrowhead, 80 miles east of Los Angeles. In March, the median price for a single-family home in Los Angeles was 17% over last year, <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> data show. Prices are up about 3% year-over- year in Lake Arrowhead, Keefe estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Likewise, Phoenix median home prices were up 19% year-over-year in March, <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> says. Prices in the vacation hot spot of Sedona, about 120 miles north, are not up as much, says associate broker Gila Hager-Sherman of Russ Lyon Sotheby's International Realty in Sedona.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason? Phoenix has a lot of investor buyers who are turning homes into rentals. In Sedona, "people don't buy to rent. They buy to live," Hager-Sherman says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Trulia</span> defined vacation areas as those in which at least a quarter of homes are used occasionally or seasonally, based on the 2010 Census. Prices per square foot show changes in values but aren't influenced by changes in the size of homes on the market, Kolko says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for vacation homes is being propelled by the same forces as the overall market, including a stronger economy and stock market. Sales will improve more this year because of increases in household wealth, says Lawrence Yun, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>' chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vacation-home buyers also see now as a good time to buy, says Diane Saatchi, agent with Saunders &amp; Associates in the Hamptons on Long Island. "They think the bottom is here, and they're tired of waiting," Saatchi says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-quarter median prices were up 11% year-over-year in the Hamptons, where a $1 million to $2 million vacation home is really a "starter" home, Saatchi says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While bargain-shopping investors have swamped Phoenix, demand in the Hamptons is strongest in the $7 million-and-up range, Saatchi says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The billionaires came back before the millionaires," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like the overall market, vacation areas see tight supplies of available homes. In Lake Arrowhead, inventories are slim for homes less than $300,000 but ample in the $600,000-to-$2-million range, Keefe says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sedona has less than half the number of homes for sale that it did four years ago. Only about 7% of them are foreclosures or short- sale properties. "They used to be 40% of the market," Hager-Sherman says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Nationwide</span>, vacation-home sales were up 10% last year, accounting for 11% of all home sales, says the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. That compared with a 17% jump for primary-residence purchases.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales rose slightly last month to their highest level since late 2009, and while the supply for sale jumped, it's still tight, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total existing home sales increased 0.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.97 million in April from an upwardly revised 4.94 million in March, the NAR said. At that level, sales were 9.7% above year-ago levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">April's annual sales rate was the highest since November 2009, when sales hit an annual rate of 5.44 million. But sales are still relatively low. From 2000 through 2005, before the housing bubble burst, monthly sales were averaging an annual rate of more than 6 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory of homes for sale, meanwhile, expanded in April to a 5.2-month supply from 4.7 months in March. That means all the homes would sell in that time-frame if no new supply were added. Realtors consider a six-month supply to be a balanced market between buyers and sellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes are also selling fast. The median time on the market for all homes was 46 days in April, down from 62 days in March and 83 days a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 12% jump in inventory in April from March made for the third- straight month of seasonally adjusted inventory expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That could mean that inventory "has finally bottomed," says Jed Kolko, chief economist for real estate website <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>. On a seasonally adjusted basis, inventory is up 4% in the past three months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family home sales rose 1.2% in April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.38 million and are 9% above the year ago pace, the NAR says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The robust housing market recovery is occurring in spite of tight access to credit and limited inventory," says Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist. "If not for those constraints, existing-home sales easily would be well above the 5 million-unit pace," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home construction is needed to alleviate the inventory tightness, he says, and "tame" price growth to a healthy pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national median existing-home price was $192,800 in April, up 11% from a year ago. Distressed homes -- foreclosures and short sales -- accounted for 18% of sales, down from 28% a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shift from distressed to conventional sales is an important sign of housing recovery. While year-over-year sales were up 9.7%, they were up 25% excluding foreclosures and short sales, Kolko says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sale numbers will continue to improve throughout the year but not do all that well, says Patrick Newport, economist at IHS Global Insight, because inventories are still "very lean."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in 10% of the nation's top 200 housing markets have recently hit new peaks or are only a hair away, new data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another 24 of the top markets are within 5% of their peaks, according to data provided to USA TODAY by real estate tracker Lender Processing Services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of those cities are likely to hit new peaks this year, economists say, given projections for continued price increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data show how far prices in many cities have rebounded since the historic housing bust after mid-2006 -- and how far they still have to go in most cities. It also underscores the uneven impact of the housing bubble, and the bust, in different regions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dozens of markets where prices peaked by 2006 are still 25% to 58% below those highs, LPS says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many cities now at or close to previous highs never saw the price run-ups leading up to the bust that others did. Then, they didn't drop as far, so they have less of a climb back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the cities within 5% of their previous peaks, none saw more than an 11% decline in home values from mid-2006 to the market's bottom in early 2012, LPS data show. Nationally, prices fell almost 28% during that time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We didn't get invited to the party, so we never had the hangover," says Ron Croushore, CEO of Prudential Preferred Realty in Pitts-burgh.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Denver, which was up almost 1% in February from its 2006 peak, suffered almost a 10% decline during the national housing bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Honolulu, which was 2% from its 2007 peak in February, had been hit with an 11% de-cline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Job growth is another factor in recovered mar-kets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Austin, Denver, Baton Rouge, Houston, Oklahoma City, and Knoxville, Tenn., are at previous highs or within 5%, LPS' data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, all posted stronger annual job growth than the national average of 1.4%, based on <span class="companylink">Bureau of Labor Statistics</span> data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Austin's job growth was 4% year-over-year. Home prices there are up 9.7% from mid-2006, LPS says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strong job market "has helped our housing market recover rather quickly," says Angelos Angelou of the Austin-based Angelou Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past year, U.S. home prices rose faster than many expected. LPS shows a 7.3% gain in February year over year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some cities have done better. Home prices in Phoenix and San Francisco were up 19%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, Phoenix is 36% off its 2006 peak. San Francisco is almost 25% off its peak, LPS says.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Big pickups haul in the sales in April ; Rising housing starts are helping</span>
</div><div class="author">James R Healey   </div><div>James R. Healey, USA TODAY,</div>
<div>521 words</div><div>2 May 2013</div><div>USA Today (Newspaper)</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.2</div><div>English</div><div>© 2013 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big pickups were April sales heroes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Full-size rigs were up a hefty 27% from April last year, while overall new vehicle sales were up less, 8.5%, according to sales tracker Autodata.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Largely because of the big-truck boom, plus strong showings from SUVs and some redesigned cars, automakers sold nearly 1.3 million new vehicles last month. That was an annual pace of 14.9 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though short of the 15 million annual rate that makes the industry breathe a sigh of relief, it was considered healthy, especially because some key models posted remarkable gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Automakers see the truck boom, which has been building all year, as more like the good ol' days rather than as a burst of interest from tradesmen replacing trucks they'd held onto through the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Full-size-truck sales are growing three times as fast as the industry," says Joe Hinrichs, Ford executive vice president and president of The Americas. "There's strong (economic) growth, and housing starts are up." Ford says it is hiring 900 workers to build even more F-150 pickups at its factory near Kansas City, Mo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of Ford's F-Series trucks were up 24.4% in April. Ford says it's been selling F-Series trucks at a rate of one every 45.5 seconds this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chrysler is reconfiguring its Warren, Mich., Ram truck plant to build a plant-record 300,000 Ram pickups annually, 32% more than last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Behind the pickup boom:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Discounting. <span class="companylink">General Motors</span> is selling down supplies of its 2013 trucks to make way for redesigned 2014s going on sale this quarter. "You're finding discounts of $5,000 to $7,000, and once Chevy moves with incentives on Silverado, you see the F-Series and the Ram follow suit," says Alec Gutierrez, analyst at <span class="companylink">Kelley Blue Book</span>. GM's Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra, combined, were up 23.7% in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The way the economy is coming back, the housing starts -- we saw a good lift," says Bob Hegbloom, director of the Ram truck brand. Ram sales in April were up 48.7%. The latest government data say housing starts in March were up 7% from February and a stunning 46.7% more than March 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moderating fuel prices. Regular gas is down about 29 cents a gallon from a year ago, travel specialist AAA says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gutierrez says the boom has legs: "It's sustainable through 2014. We're not expecting it to reverse course."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">April highlights beyond trucks:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Volkswagen</span> ran out of steam. Its sales fell 10.3%. Corporate affiliates Audi and Porsche were up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subaru zoomed 25%, powered by a new Forester.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Mazda</span> fell 7.5% despite a 78% gain from its CX-5 SUV. The redesigned Mazda6 midsize sedan had little traction, down 22.4%.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Job growth helps fuel home prices ; Tight supply, investors also contribute in cities with hot housing markets</span>
</div><div class="author">Julie Schmit   </div><div>Julie Schmit, @JulieSchmit, USA TODAY</div>
<div>538 words</div><div>1 May 2013</div><div>USA Today (Newspaper)</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.2</div><div>English</div><div>© 2013 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A tight housing supply and investor buyers pushed up February home prices at their fastest monthly rate in eight years, but job growth is a factor, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In February, the three cities with the strongest price growth year-over-year all posted faster job growth than the national average, government data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Prices are growing faster in markets with stronger job growth," says Jed Kolko, chief economist for real estate website <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices jumped 9.3% in February from a year ago and rose 1.2% from January on a seasonally adjusted basis, the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case-Shiller index of 20 leading cities shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest gainer year-over-year remains Phoenix, up 23%. Next was San Francisco, up almost 19%, and Las Vegas, almost 18%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bringing up the rear? New York, with a 1.9% annual gain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors are a big part of the Phoenix run-up. They accounted for almost 28% of March sales, says real estate expert Mike Orr at <span class="companylink">Arizona State University</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, Phoenix has a 2.9-month supply of homes for sale, meaning they'd all sell in that time frame if sales continued at the same rate and no new supply was added. Realtors consider a six-month supply to be balanced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">San Francisco also has too many buyers chasing too few homes. In February, its single-family home supply stood at 3.1 months, the <span class="companylink">California Association of Realtors</span> says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Phoenix, San Francisco and Las Vegas also saw job growth in February that beat the national average of 1.5% year over year, according to Kolko's analysis of <span class="companylink">Bureau of Labor Statistics</span> data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phoenix posted a 2.4% gain; San Francisco, 3.6%; and Las Vegas, 2%, Kolko says. New York, meanwhile, saw 1.3% job growth in February year-over-year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Detroit prices were also up sharply, 15.2% year-over-year. Yet, Detroit's job growth in February was largely flat compared with a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The disconnect points to a lot of investor buyers for Detroit homes, Kolko says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, prices are so low in parts of Detroit that "renting makes no sense," says Stan Humphries, Zillow chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Denver has also seen faster-than-average job growth, posting a 3.1% year-over-year gain in February. Its home prices were up almost 10% year-over-year, Case-Shiller says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Case-Shiller shows Denver's February prices just shy of their 2006 peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zillow's home value index, meanwhile, shows Denver hitting a new peak last month at $234,200.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dallas/Fort Worth region and Charlotte are also close to hitting their pre-housing-bust peaks, Zillow's data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More strong price gains are likely for much of the year, says Paul Diggle, economist with Capital Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's because the national supply of homes for sale, at 4.7 months in March, is expected to remain tight while the job situation slowly improves.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stock market keeps doing what skeptics keep saying it has no business doing given the economy's weakened state: It keeps climbing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monday was another record-setting day on Wall Street. The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index hit an all-time closing high, rising 0.7% to 1593.61 and inching above its April 11 peak and ever closer to the 1600 level. The Nasdaq composite, home to well-known tech stocks such as Apple, <span class="companylink">Google</span> and <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>, notched a new high for the year on its way to its highest close in 12 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a classic bull market rally," says Martin Leclerc, chief investment officer at Barrack Yard Advisors. "It was born amid much pessimism and has climbed a wall of worry and skepticism. Given how powerful the move has been, it would be unusual for the bull to roll over and die unless something exogenous occurs that nobody sees coming."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All investors saw Monday was green.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a sign of strength and investor willingness to take more risk, there was a marked shift in what worked and didn't work. The gains were driven by so-called bull market sectors, such as technology, materials and energy shares. These former laggards enjoyed bigger price pops than did the defensive names, which sport plump dividends and have been leading the performance derby for most of the year but have gotten increasingly expensive, such as health care and consumer staples stocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gains came on a day when the first-quarter earnings season rolled on, with a better-than-expected seven out of 10 companies topping Wall Street forecasts. Reports showing March pending home sales at a three-year high, and rises in consumer spending and income, also added to the bullish tone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors were also emboldened from what they hope will be continued market support from central banks around the world, given persistent economic weakness and still-low inflation. Investors expect the U.S. Federal Reserve to announce that its easy-money policies will remain intact when the central bank's two-day meeting ends Wednesday. There is also an expectation that the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> will slash its main borrowing rate by a quarter- percentage point Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there's one caveat to the bullish vibe on Wall Street, it is that the gains are coming on the eve of what traditionally has been the worst seasonal time to own stocks. The old adage "Sell in May and Go Away" is due to the fact that stocks have fared far better in the November-to-April period than the May-through-October span.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past 50 years, the S&amp;P 500 has gained an average 6.9% in the six-month stretch ending in April and just 0.8% in the six months beginning in May, Bespoke Investment Group says.</p>

<div>497 words</div><div>25 April 2013</div><div>USA Today (Newspaper)</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.2</div><div>English</div><div>© 2013 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">National home price gains slowed in the first quarter after a big push late last year but remained at a "boil" in some markets, according to real estate website Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zillow's first-quarter home value index was up 0.5% from the fourth quarter of last year, it says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was compared with a 2.1% jump in the fourth quarter from the third, Zillow says, and was the smallest quarter-to-quarter gain since the home price recovery began.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slower rate is "indicative of a market that is slowly finding its natural level," says Stan Humphries, Zillow chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices have rebounded more strongly in the past year than many expected, and the sometimes dramatic run-ups in value were never expected to be sustainable, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A home value index kept by John Burns Real Estate Consulting shows national prices up 5.7% in the first quarter of 2013 over the first quarter of 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's just a smidge slower than the 5.9% jump from the fourth quarter of 2011 to the fourth quarter of 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I was surprised by it. We're not getting any anecdotes that the market is slowing," says CEO John Burns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zillow's data show seven of the nation's top 30 markets saw a decline in home values in the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York had a decline of 0.3% after three consecutive quarters of appreciation, Zillow's data show. Year-over-year, New York's prices were still up 1.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chicago saw the greatest depreciation, with values falling 1.4% in the quarter after a flat fourth quarter in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zillow's home value index is calculated using actual and estimated sales data. Various home price indexes often come up with different values on a national and metro basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the national pace of gain may have slowed in the first quarter, some metros still saw torrid increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Las Vegas and Sacramento, for instance, saw prices rise 7.1% quarter to quarter, the most of any of the 30 major metros in Zillow's study. That pace bested their previous quarter climbs of 5.8% and 6.1%, respectively, the data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a year-over-year basis, Phoenix continued to lead with the biggest price jump, up 24% in the first quarter, Zillow says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There have been some signs of slowing price growth in that market, says Mike Orr, real estate expert at the W.P. Carey School of Business at <span class="companylink">Arizona State University</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the rapid run-up in prices, some people are getting priced out of the market and investors are slowing purchases, Orr says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's still strong upward pressure," he says, but not "going up as fast as last year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zillow's data show values up 5.1% in the quarter year-over-year.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Buyers are out there, but homeowners are staying put ; Sales dip on tight supply, but rising prices could change that</span>
</div><div class="author">Julie Schmit   </div><div>Julie Schmit, @JulieSchmit, USA TODAY</div>
<div>574 words</div><div>23 April 2013</div><div>USA Today (Newspaper)</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.4</div><div>English</div><div>© 2013 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month's dip in existing-home sales may signal that the recovery in sales has hit a lull that only higher prices can cure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total existing-home sales fell 0.6% in March from February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.92 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slip, which surprised Wall Street analysts, was blamed largely on a lack of supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyer traffic was 25% above year-ago levels, NAR says, but housing inventories were down almost 17% year-over-year. Meanwhile, home sales were up 10.3% from March 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There isn't enough supply," says Michael Montgomery, economist at IHS Global Insight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He says sales volumes are likely to post only "token" changes in coming months until more people -- enticed by higher home prices -- list their homes for sale, which will then draw more buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The recovery in housing sales is on pause, but as prices rise, fence-sitters will get off the fence," Montgomery says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, the supply of homes for sale stood at 4.7 months, NAR says, meaning they'd all sell out at the current pace of sales if no new supply came on the market. Generally, a six-month supply is considered balanced between buyers and sellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tight supply is propelling prices. The national median existing-home price was $184,300 in March, up almost 12% year-over- year, NAR says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those big price gains will lift more people out of the situation in which they owe more on their homes than they're worth, which will lead to more sellers, says Stan Humphries, Zillow chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost 2 million fewer homeowners were underwater at the end of last year than a year earlier, Zillow data show. Nationwide, 13.8 million homeowners with a mortgage were underwater at the end of last year, Zillow says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were other signs in the existing-home sales report pointing toward a market headed toward more normal patterns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the second month in a row, inventory was up slightly even after adjusting for seasonal factors, says Jed Kolko, chief economist of real estate website <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's more, conventional sellers -- those not experiencing a foreclosure or short sale -- accounted for 79% of sales. That was up from 71% of sales a year ago and just 60% of sales two years ago, NAR data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More expensive homes were also seeing strong gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes priced below $100,000 posted a 16% drop in sales, NAR says. Meanwhile, homes in all other price ranges were up year-over-year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of homes priced from $250,000 to $500,000, for instance, jumped 22% year over year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The market is stronger by the month," says Glenn Kelman, CEO of online brokerage Redfin. The stronger sales of more expensive homes is "part of a larger trend" away from investor buyers snapping up foreclosures to more traditional buyers looking for homes to live in, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent survey of Redfin home sellers found that 93% of them expected to get enough money from a home sale to repay their mortgages. That was up from 86% to 89% in August and October.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of newly listed homes for sale is starting to show signs of keeping pace with buyer activity in some of the nation's hottest real estate markets, new data suggest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 21 of 24 major metropolitan markets tracked by residential brokerage ZipRealty, new listings outnumbered new sales contracts for the 30 days ended March 15.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supply may "finally start to keep pace with frenzied buyer activity," says Lanny Baker, Zip-Realty CEO.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sellers in Los Angeles, for instance, put 16,170 homes on the market mid-February to mid-March. At the same time, only 9,533 homes entered sales contracts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other cities seeing the same situation included Phoenix -- where January home prices were up 23% year-over-year, <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case-Shiller data show -- the San Francisco Bay Area, Denver and Houston. San Francisco home prices followed Phoenix's gain with an almost 18% pop in January year-over-year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, new pending sales outnumbered new listings only in Las Vegas, Washington and Raleigh, N.C., ZipRealty says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, the supply of homes for sale stood at 4.7 months in February, meaning they'd all sell in that time frame if no new supply were added, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> says. That's up from 4.3 months the previous month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Generally, Realtors consider a six-month to seven-month supply to be a balanced market between buyers and sellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tighter-than-normal supply has helped lift prices and led to multiple offers in many markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In seven of the cities analyzed by ZipRealty, more than one- fourth of the homes listed for sale sold in less than seven days. Those cities were Las Vegas, Orange County and Sacramento in California, Denver, Washington, Seattle and Austin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lower-than-normal supply is also putting a drag on sales, Realtors and market watchers say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Phoenix market has about 20,000 homes listed for sale. That's about 13,000 fewer than would be normal, says Mike Orr, real estate expert at the W.P Carey School of Business at <span class="companylink">Arizona State University</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The biggest problem we have is supply," Orr says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Orange County, the inventory of single-family homes and condominiums listed for sale has risen 10% since April 1, says Steven Thomas, of trade publication Reports on Housing. That's the biggest expansion in about two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some homeowners are "testing the waters and attempting to fetch prices that are just way too off the mark," he says. He expects inventories to keep growing as those homes sit longer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some Sacramento-area home sellers are likewise being too zealous with prices, says Joanie Cubias of Lyon Real Estate. More appraisals are now falling short as sellers over-price, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If homes are priced right, however, "There's 10 buyers for every house," Cubias says, especially for homes priced below $350,000.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past year, we have seen solid growth in house prices in most areas of the country, double-digit growth in both new and existing home sales, and a continuing flood of mortgage refinancing. While this should not be cause for breaking out the champagne, we can at least say that things are moving in the right direction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many people might not appreciate the extent of the recovery because they continue to think of the housing market as though the years of the bubble were normal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, existing home sales were 4.65 million in 2012. By comparison, existing homes sales averaged fewer than 3.5 million in the years 1993-95, before the housing bubble began to drive the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even adjusting for population growth, the 2012 sales rate was far above the pre-bubble pace even if it is well below bubble peaks of more than 7 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction has also been rising rapidly, albeit from a very low base. The continuing weakness in construction should not be surprising. The building boom of the bubble years has left the country with an enormous oversupply of housing. Vacancy rates are still near record highs, in spite of being down from peaks reached in 2009-10.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This huge backlog of vacant homes will prevent construction from returning to normal (not bubble) levels for several years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve's low interest policy deserves serious credit here. This has made it much easier to buy homes than would otherwise be the case. It also has put money in the economy through refinancing. If we assume that the average mortgage interest rate has fallen one percentage point as a result of Fed policy, it means that homeowners have an additional $80 billion (0.5% of GDP) to spend each year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, many people still can't buy homes. But this is the result of high unemployment -- an area where the government has done a very poor job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are serious grounds for complaint about the response to the housing crash. Too little has been done to allow underwater homeowners to stay in their homes. The first-time home buyers' tax credit was a monument to misguided policy, encouraging people to buy homes at bubble-inflated prices. Speculative bubbles, driven by investors, appear to be growing in several markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, on the whole, the housing market seems to be on a positive path at the moment.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More Americans appear to be moving as a better economy and a stronger housing market take hold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January and February, 5.4% more households moved this year than last, based on data from the nine largest moving companies, says the American Moving &amp; <span class="companylink">Storage Association</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the same period a year ago, household moves were up 2.9% from 2011, it says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The industry data underscore broader government data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An estimated 36.5 million people 1 year and older moved in 2012, up from 35.1 million in 2011, the Census Bureau says. It put the mover rate last year at 12% of the population, up from a record low of 11.6% in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economic instability and weak home values have delayed moves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Survey data from Mayflower, a large moving company, show that the average American moves six times in their adult life, but 49% of those recently surveyed said they put off moving since the housing bubble burst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of those who had delayed a move, 37% cited economic instability as the main reason, while 31% blamed the declining real estate market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Millennials -- those between ages 18 to and 34 -- are most likely to consider moving, the Mayflower survey says. About half of them say they'll consider it in the next year. Nearly a third of the 1,020 respondents said they'd consider moving in the next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the Millennial respondents, 34% said they'd be more likely to rent today, down from 55% five years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For those planning a move in the next year, the most common reasons were to get to a new or better home or neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising home values make it easier for some people to move. Home prices were up 8.1% in January from a year earlier according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller index. Existing home sales were also up 10% in February from a year ago, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the economy recovers, people are moving longer distances, says Jed Kolko, economist of real estate website <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of last year's increase in household moves involved re- settlements in another county or state, he says. Meanwhile, there was little change in the number of moves to another house within the same county.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New jobs often require longer-distance moves, so the increase in cross-county and cross-state moves is a sign that more people are moving for jobs, Kolko says.</p>

</div><div class="author">Julie Schmit   </div><div>Julie Schmit, USA TODAY,</div>
<div>1393 words</div><div>1 April 2013</div><div>USA Today (Newspaper)</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>A.1</div><div>English</div><div>© 2013 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four years ago, Dave Peterson was in the worst financial crisis of his life. He was in foreclosure, had declared bankruptcy and was struggling to find a place to rent in Las Vegas because of his terrible credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But last year he and his wife, Gabby, bought a $280,000 home that's bigger than the one they lost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peterson is a "boomerang buyer," one of several million who'll return to the market in the coming years, real estate experts say, bringing needed muscle to a housing market that seems to be finding its footing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are people who lost homes in foreclosures and short sales in the historic housing bust who are striving to be homeowners again. Their time out of the market may be shorter than many Americans might expect. People who go through foreclosure can rebuild credit records and qualify for home loans again in three to seven years if they manage their finances well. With home prices still low and interest rates near record lows, today's boomerang buyers might find their next mortgage more affordable than their last one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boomerang buyers are most prevalent in areas such as California and Arizona that were hardest hit by foreclosures, and their return is contributing to rebounds in those markets. Going forward, growing num-bers of boomerang buyers could help offset the expected slackening in demand from investors as home prices rise, says Stan Humphries, economist for real estate website Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2007, more than 4.7 million homeowners are estimated to have lost homes to foreclosure or short sale. Seven in 10 will return to homeownership within eight years of their short sale or foreclosure, estimates <span class="companylink">John Burns Real Estate</span> Consulting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the start of the housing bust now six years past, this will be the first big year for returnees, accounting for 10% of home sales, up from 4% last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They'll stay at that level until starting to subside in 2016, about eight years after the height of the foreclosure crisis, Burns projects. His firm estimates the crop of boomerang buyers who lost homes in 2007 through 2012 will exceed 500,000 a year in 2013 through 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already, boomerang buyers are adding up to real numbers in some markets. In Phoenix, one of the areas hardest hit by foreclosures, 40% of Academy Mortgage's home-purchase customers are boomerang buyers, estimates Chad Melin, Academy's branch manager in Chandler, Ariz.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In San Diego, such buyers account for 20% of new home sales for builder <span class="companylink">Cornerstone Communities</span>, says its president, Michael Sabourin. They started shopping in 2011 but didn't qualify and came back in greater numbers last year. "We really see them today," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BOOMERANGERS OUT WEST</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Southern California and across the Southwest, almost 14% of new home sales in the last half of 2012 were to boomerang buyers, according to a Burns Consulting home builder survey of 178 builders nationwide. That compares with less than 5% of new home buyers in the Northeast, Southeast and Northwest, the survey shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outside the West, other large cities with many foreclosures will also see substantial numbers of boomerang buyers, Burns says. Those include Atlanta, Chicago, Miami, Orlando and Washington, D.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like Peterson, some have already purchased again. He got his new home loan through the Department of Veterans Affairs, paid no money down and got a 3.74%, 30-year fixed-rate loan last April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the 60% drop in Las Vegas home prices from 2006, Peterson now pays $1,600 a month in mortgage costs vs. $3,000 for the smaller house he lost. While his previous house plunged in value with the housing bust, his new house has risen in value, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Las Vegas prices were up almost 13% in December year-over-year, <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case-Shiller data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our development is booming," Peterson says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WATCHING THE CALENDAR</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other boomerangers are counting the days until they can buy again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They know the exact date they can qualify," says Dennis Webb, sales executive with <span class="companylink">Fulton Homes</span> in Phoenix. He says such buyers make up about 20% of Fulton's Phoenix-area sales. The builder expects to finish 750 new homes this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the buyers get loans from the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span>, which requires just 3.5% down payments vs. 20% for many conventional loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FHA borrowers can also have less-stellar credit. In January, their average credit score stood at 717 vs. 767 for conventional- loan borrowers, according to data from mortgage tracker Lender Processing Services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If consumers repair credit, they generally face waits of two to seven years to become eligible for home loans after a foreclosure or short sale. A short sale occurs when lenders allow a home's sale for less than what's owed. The FHA wait is three years for either one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like Peterson, Hoss and Terri Wylie are homeowners again. A house they bought in 2006 was lost in foreclosure following a job loss. The couple just closed on a $147,000 home in Phoenix, three years after their foreclosure. They got an FHA loan at a 3.55% interest rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During their wait, the couple rebuilt their credit score to a respectable 700-plus, from below 500, where it sank after their foreclosure. The Wylies also paid off a $4,700 car loan and $5,000 in credit card debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We just really buckled down," Hoss Wylie, 50, says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They, too, have seen their new home rise in value. Phoenix prices jumped 23% last year, S&amp;P data show. "We bought the last $147,000 house" in the neighborhood, Wylie says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even after the financial wreckage of a short sale or foreclosure, boomerang buyers say they're driven to own for the same reasons they bought before. They want their own place. They see it as a good investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rent vs. own equation is also driving homeownership. Nationwide, buying a home is now 44% cheaper than renting in 100 leading metro areas, data from real estate website <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> indicate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Helping affordability: interest rates below 4% and home prices still 30% off their 2006 peaks. Rents, meanwhile, have risen 8.3% in the past 2.5 years, Zillow data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A lot of these people are just doing the math," says Sean Fergus, analyst for Burns Consulting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Trulia</span>'s rent vs. buy calculation assumes a 3.5% 30-year fixed- rate mortgage, 20% down and seven years in the home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To rent a smaller home, the Wylies paid $1,000 a month, and that was headed to $1,200 this year, Hoss Wylie says. By owning, they pay $952 a month, which includes all costs, except utilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phillip Greene, 28, did the same calculation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Seattle real estate liaison for online brokerage Redfin went through a bankruptcy and foreclosure in 2009 after he lost half of his income because of the real estate downturn. The condominium he bought in 2006, near the height of the market, tanked in value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greene rebuilt his credit and now touts a credit score above 680, he says. He secured an FHA loan and bought a $190,000 house in February. He paid $1,600 a month to rent a similar-size house. He's paying $1,500 a month to own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I could buy this house and rent it out for more than my mortgage," Greene says. "It would be crazy not to buy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet other former homeowners stung by a foreclosure or short sale have had enough, and three in 10 won't return to the market, Burns estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if they could buy again, some previous homeowners will remain renters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's a select group of people who've said, 'I'm done with homeownership. I got burned too badly,'" Fergus says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today's tighter mortgage credit standards will trip up others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, new mortgage holders had credit scores that averaged 745, up from 699 in 2006 at the peak of the housing bubble, LPS says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Getting a mortgage these days isn't for the average Joe," says Guy Cecala, publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stock market's record-setting rally has helped U.S. households recover all of the wealth they lost in the Great Recession, prompting many Americans to open their wallets and shrug off a recent payroll tax hike.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stock run-up and rising home prices buoy consumer confidence and spending. Growing signs of an improving economy are prompting many economists to raise forecasts for first-quarter economic growth despite federal budget cuts that are expected to slow the recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index, a broad, closely watched barometer of the stock market, set a new closing high Thursday, joining other stock indexes that recently broke records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rally, along with rising home prices and reduced consumer debt, pushed household net worth to $66.1 trillion in the fourth quarter, just shy of the record $67.4 trillion in 2007. This year's bull market has nudged household wealth to a new high, but precise figures aren't available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans' net worth fell by $16 trillion to $51.4 trillion in early 2009 as the real estate crash devastated home values and the financial crisis and recession pummeled stocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, the Wilshire 5000 Total Market index, which includes about 3,700 stocks, is up 142%, or $11.7 trillion, since its March 2009 low. And home prices, which fell 35% from July 2006 to March 2012, are up 9% from their lows, according to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A rise in the value of household assets creates a wealth effect that economists say prompts consumers to spend more. Each additional dollar in household wealth traditionally has led to an additional 5 cents in spending. Mark Zandi, chief economist of <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics, says the wealth effect is likely about 3 cents now because the downturn made many Americans more cautious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although most of the increase in household wealth can be traced to climbing stock values, only about half of U.S. households own stocks, Zandi says. Only about 10% have significant holdings, says Beata Caranci, deputy chief economist at TD Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wealth effects will become more pronounced as home prices continue to rise, because two-thirds of households own homes.</p>

</div><div class="author">Julie Schmit   </div><div>Julie Schmit, @JulieSchmit, USA TODAY</div>
<div>463 words</div><div>22 March 2013</div><div>USA Today (Newspaper)</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.1</div><div>English</div><div>© 2013 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales rose modestly in February and more people listed homes for sale, the first sign of a potential turnaround in a supply crunch in some markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales rose 0.8% in February from January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.98 million, 10.2% above last year's level, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales rate was the highest since November 2009, when a federal tax credit propped up home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A more important number in the report may be the supply of homes for sale. That rose to 4.7 months, at the current pace of sales, up from 4.3 months in January, NAR says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase in supply is the first of any real significance for more than two years, says Paul Diggle, economist for Capital Economics. While too soon to say that the trough in supply is past, "We get the sense that it's close," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Historically, Realtors have considered a six-month supply to be balanced between buyers and sellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if the inventory crunch is on the verge of easing, "it'll be years, not months," to get it back to more normal levels, says Jed Kolko, chief economist for real estate website <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>. That's because inventory is so low and new home construction, while picking up, hasn't yet caught up to the pace of new household formation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">February's uptick in supply "may be the first hint of a trend or it may be a blip," Kolko says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the increase in total inventory, up almost 10% to 1.94 million homes, was seasonal, says Patrick Newport, economist at IHS Global Insight. Typically, inventory rises about 6% in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with the increase, February's inventory of single-family homes for sale was at an 18-year low, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The low inventories are adding up to rising prices, multiple offers and a slowdown in sales in some markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In February, California's single-family home sales were down almost 6% from a year earlier, in part because of listing shortages, the <span class="companylink">California Association of Realtors</span> says. California's supply of single-family homes for sale stood at 3.6 months in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In parts of the Silicon Valley and San Francisco, more homes are selling even before they hit the multiple listing service, says Rick Turley, president of Coldwell Banker in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He estimates that off-market sales are running at 25% or more in Palo Alto and Menlo Park. Without such tight inventories of homes for sale, they'd be 2% to 4% of sales, he says. Multiple offers are also common.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't count on home prices rising as much as they did last year - - a 7%-plus jump from the housing bust's bottom -- economists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller housing index, released Tuesday, showed national home prices up 7.3% for 2012, vs. 2011 -- the strongest move since 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In nine of 20 cities measured, prices were up more than 9% in December vs. a year earlier, S&amp;P says. Phoenix led the way, with a 23% rise, followed by San Francisco at 14.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We had a burst coming out of the gate," says David Blitzer, chairman of S&amp;P's index committee. Going forward, the rates of appreciation "will not be as aggressively beautiful as they've been."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market hit bottom in the first quarter of 2012. That will make big jumps in year-over-year gains harder to achieve going forward, he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's more, some cities with big jumps driven by investor buyers may not see a repeat this year, says Paul Diggle, economist at Capital Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Phoenix, for instance, last year's 23% jump was heavily fueled by investors who are turning single-family homes into rentals. When prices jump that much, they reduce rental returns, which lessens investor demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Some of the biggest boom towns will come off the boil," Diggle says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price gains fueled by investors have been most evident in Phoenix, Detroit and Las Vegas, says Jed Kolko, economist at <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>, a real estate website. S&amp;P data show Detroit prices up 13.6% year- over-year; Las Vegas, up 12.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investor interest may cool in those markets, but other cities will see price gains driven by strong job growth, lower vacancy rates and small foreclosure backlogs, Kolko says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For this year, Capital Economics forecasts a 5% rise in national home prices. Market watcher Zillow forecasts a 3.3% jump vs. the 5.9% rise its data showed for last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising prices will enable more homeowners to sell, which will also hold down price gains, says Zillow economist Stan Humphries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, the supply of existing homes for sale hit an almost eight-year low, helping to fuel bidding wars, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> says. New home sales jumped almost 16% in January from December to a 437,000 annual rate, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As new home sales pick up, so will construction. That, too, will work to moderate price gains, Humphries says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices may be in for a rockier year than many predict, says Mark Hanson, who advises professionals on real estate trends. Low interest rates, fueled by the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>, have goosed home buyer demand and enabled buyers to pay more for homes, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has been below 4% for more than 15 months, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> data show. Rates edged up slightly last week, to 3.56% for the average 30-year fixed loan, and they're expected to go higher if the economy improves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher interest rates will lead to a "hangover" for home prices, Hanson says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signs of spring abound on a tree-lined street here in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daffodils have sprouted. New plants have been potted. But one harbinger of spring is missing. There are no "For Sale" signs on this street of 116 homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lack of home sellers on Moraga Boulevard as the spring selling season nears is of little surprise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, the supply of existing homes for sale has fallen for seven straight months, hitting an almost eight-year low in January, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Competing offers for the same homes are rising in more markets, especially in the West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the country is now a seller's market, the Realtors group says, just one year into a potential housing recovery following the worst downturn since the Great Depression.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shortage of sellers, a force behind higher prices, is expected to ease as prices rise, economists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a return to healthy inventory levels could take years. Many homeowners can't afford to sell, because they don't have enough equity to put into buying another house -- or would have to write a check to sell. The supply of distressed houses for sale is thinning as the foreclosure crisis recedes, especially in some states. Home building, while improving, is still at low levels. And, after years of holding on, few homeowners want to sell when prices are just coming off the bottom, Realtors say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're making a painful transition from a market dominated by distressed sellers to a market in which the only people selling are people who want to sell," says Glenn Kelman, CEO of online brokerage Redfin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nation now has a 4.2-month supply of existing homes for sale. A healthy market, defined as a six-month to seven-month supply, will arrive when home prices rise another 20%, estimates John Burns, CEO of John Burns Real Estate Consulting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A jump that size will lure enough sellers to match demand pouring in from renters and investors, he says. Rising prices will also drive more home building, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices are already up more than many expected this time last year. The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case-Shiller index shows them up 7.3% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, S&amp;P said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising prices spurred expectations that more sellers would appear. But listing data for 2013 show no such turnaround.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, homes listed for sale were down almost 17% year-over- year in 146 major markets, data from Realtor.com show. Two dozen markets saw drops in excess of 25%, including many in California but also Seattle, Atlanta, Minneapolis and Washington, D.C. All have a smaller supply of homes for sale than the national average of 4.2 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That number, from the Realtors association, means that if no more homes came on the market, they would all sell in 4.2 months at the current sales pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Listings picked up in late January and early February but "not enough to meet demand," says Rick Turley, president of <span class="companylink">Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage</span> for the San Francisco Bay Area. In super-competitive Silicon Valley markets, the supply of homes is down to a week, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Buyers and agents are literally waiting for the next house," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brad and Annie Sarsfield, of Seattle, joined the sellers in January. They sold a townhouse and a condo and are buying a single- family home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple are expecting their second child in April and wanted a bigger home. To pull that off, they had to forgo living in Seattle and move to a suburb 25 minutes away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's because the supply of homes for sale in parts of the Seattle region are running at less than two months, the Northwest Multiple Listing Service says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If a home that the Sarsfields liked came on the market in the city, "It was gone in a weekend," says Brad Sarsfield, 35, a software engineer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the couple had buyers for their condo and townhouse within a week of listing them, Sarsfield says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a great time to be a seller," he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So why aren't there more of them?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Owners without equity club</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many homeowners are still equity-poor, economists and Realtors say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, almost 28% of homeowners with home loans owe more on their loans than their homes are worth, data from market watcher Zillow show. That's 13.8 million homeowners. They'd likely have to write a check to sell, especially if they have to pay a Realtor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some areas where home supplies are especially tight, even more mortgaged homeowners are underwater. In Las Vegas and Atlanta, it's one of two. In Sacramento and Phoenix, it's four of 10, Zillow data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An even bigger chunk of mortgaged homeowners -- 45% -- have less than 20% equity. That much is generally needed to sell, pay a Realtor commission and have a hefty enough down payment to get the best loan terms to buy again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They are stuck. They are zombies," says Mark Hanson, a California adviser to professional investors on housing and mortgage issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then again, some owners may be surprised to find they can sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year ago, Atlanta prices were still falling. Now, they're surging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In most areas of Atlanta, people would be shocked as to what their homes are now worth," says Mike Prewett, president of Southern REO Associates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market turned so fast, "people haven't caught up," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">S&amp;P data show Atlanta home prices up 9.9% in December year-over- year, its biggest annual jump in at least 20 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other homeowners are waiting for prices to go even higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With prices rising, "There's no rush to sell," says Realtor Michele Schuler, with Coldwell Banker Bain near Seattle. "At the same time, there's a lot of fear. If they sell, will they find another place to live?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tighter mortgage loan standards have also made buying and selling harder to pull off. For instance, lenders often used to extend lines of credit against existing homes so move-up buyers could raise down payments to buy. They're far less likely to do that now, says Karen Mayfield, national mortgage sales manager for the <span class="companylink">Bank of the West</span>. Income qualifications are also tougher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In competitive markets, that means owners may have to sell, then rent while looking for another house to buy. For families with kids and pets, that's a daunting prospect. "Many people are frantic about not being able to find temporary housing," Mayfield says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dynnel Ryan would love to sell, but not at today's prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She and her husband, Zack, bought a home in Lafayette in 2004, shortly before the market peaked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With three kids under age 5, "the walls close in" because the 1,900-square-footer feels too small, says Dynnel, a part-time photographer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite last year's price gains, she says they would lose money if they sold the house. They paid $639,000 and put another $200,000 into it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I want to at least break even," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also hurting supplies: There are fewer distressed properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 23 markets tracked by online brokerage Redfin, including 12 in the West, 46% fewer bank-owned listings were added in the first six weeks of this year vs. the same time last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bank-owned listings -- distressed properties taken over by lenders, often through foreclosure -- had been trending down for most of the year, Kelman says. The bigger change was in 54% fewer short sales, which banks gravitated to last year as an alternative to foreclosure. A short sale is when a home is sold for less than the mortgage balance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of existing homes for sale peaked in July 2010, with a 12.1-month supply, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An urge to stay put</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moraga Boulevard offers other clues as to the dearth of home sellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The street is popular because of its proximity to downtown and local schools. It's favored by young families, who often move up and out as families and budgets expand, and by downsizers leaving bigger homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than half of the boulevard's homeowners have more than 20% equity in their homes or own them outright, according to ForeclosureRadar, which tracks real estate markets in five Western states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before prices started to tank here, four to six homes on the street turned over every year, based on data from real estate website <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's a different mentality now," says Clark Thompson, a broker at local real estate firm Village Associates. "More people are saying, 'I'm perfectly content to stay.'"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a recent Sunday, he was visiting friends Alex and Carrie Cox. They bought on the street in 2007. With two children 7 and 9, the couple added on to their home two years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both of them work in computer-related sales and could buy up if they wanted. "We'd rather save our money and retire," says Carrie Cox, 39.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rosie and Michael Marchiano, too, watched Moraga neighbors move up and out. They stayed, even though the 1,915-square-foot house is a bit cramped now that their kids are teenagers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the market's peak, their home was worth an estimated $1.2 million, up almost 50% from what they paid for it in 2002, estimates Rosie Marchiano, 52. It's probably fallen back to about $900,000, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I've seen friends lose jobs, and it's made me pause," Marchiano says. "If I was tempted in the past by going into other people's bigger homes, I'm not tempted anymore."</p>

</div><div class="author">Julie Schmit   </div><div>Julie Schmit, @JulieSchmit, USA TODAY</div>
<div>569 words</div><div>19 February 2013</div><div>USA Today (Newspaper)</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.1</div><div>English</div><div>© 2013 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many states with faster foreclosure processes are seeing sharper increases in home prices than states where foreclosures take longer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are exceptions, and other factors -- such as job growth -- are likely stronger drivers of home price trends, economists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But home price data generally show stronger price increases in states where courts don't have to approve foreclosures than in states where they do. Foreclosures are completed faster where court approval isn't necessary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, home values tracked by Zillow, a Web-based real estate tracker, rose an average 5.4% in the 24 states where foreclosures don't go through the courts, according to Zillow. Where they do, the average increase was 3.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asking prices, a leading indicator of price trends, show a similar pattern.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, asking prices in non-judicial states were up an average of 7.3% year-over-year vs. 3.1% for judicial foreclosure states, show data from real estate website <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Non-judicial foreclosure states have tended to clear out distressed home inventory quicker, which is helping prices, says John Burns, CEO of John Burns Real Estate Consulting. The 10 major metropolitan areas that have seen the most rapid appreciation in home prices in the past year are in non-judicial foreclosure states, the firm says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Job growth and how far prices dropped during the housing bust are probably stronger drivers of home price trends, says <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> economist Jed Kolko. But foreclosure speeds are a contributor, he and others say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Florida, New York and New Jersey -- all judicial foreclosure states -- the average loan in foreclosure was past due for more than 31 months before the process was completed, according to December data from Lender Processing Services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In California, Arizona and Nevada -- all non-judicial foreclosure states -- that average was fewer than 22 months, LPS data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those three states were among the top seven in terms of home value gains last year, Zillow's data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes lingering in foreclosure "creates real uncertainty," which hurts prices, and inhibits investor buyers, says Stan Humphries, Zillow's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors have played a big role in driving prices higher in Arizona, Nevada and California, he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of December, 10% of Florida's home loans were still in some stage of foreclosure, the highest percentage in the nation. Behind it were New Jersey, at 7%, and New York, at 5%, according to <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Florida home values, up 6.4% last year, bested the national rise of 5.9%, Zillow's data show. But values rose less than 1% last year in New York and New Jersey, Zillow says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Florida values would probably have risen more if more of its foreclosures were behind it, says Kolko.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's because Florida, like Arizona, California and Nevada, saw home prices fall more than 40% from their peak before the housing bust. It's also a market that attracts investors and second-home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Exceptions to the trends in price gains between judicial and non- judicial foreclosure states underscore that many factors influence home values, Kolko says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, Zillow's data show strong price gains last year in Indiana, a judicial state. Rhode Island had the greatest price depreciation last year, the data show, and it's a non-judicial state.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2013-02-01-Mortgage-rates-rise-slightly-no-big-hike- expected_ST_U.xml</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">^$^Mortgage interest rates have ticked up for three of the past four weeks, and while big increases are unlikely, further drops are, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage hit 3.53% this week, the first time rates pushed above 3.5% in more than three months, mortgage giant <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> reported Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I do think that perhaps the all-time low is behind us," says Freddie's chief economist, Frank Nothaft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was set in November when 3.31% was the average for a 30- year fixed-rate loan, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>'s weekly mortgage rate surveys.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the rest of 2013, Nothaft expects rates to gradually rise, ending the year at about 3.75% and then moving above 4% next year. "There's no point to dilly-dally" to wait for lower rates if someone is considering refinancing their home, Nothaft says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising rates will affect homeowners looking to refinance more than home shoppers, says Jed Kolko, chief economist with real estate website <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>. That's because refinancing is mainly an interest-rate-driven decision, while home purchases have more to do with jobs and lifestyle changes, he said. Even though they're up, rates are still near historic lows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with an improving economy, rates have edged up, given less demand for "safe haven investments" such as bonds since Congress partly averted the so-called fiscal cliff of tax increases and spending cuts on Jan. 1, says Greg McBride, senior financial analyst for Bankrate.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McBride said mortgage interest rates may dip below current levels on occasion. He, too, expects them to hover between 3.5% and 4% for most of this year. That assumes no big shocks to the U.S. economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Except for a few weeks, mortgage rates have been below 4% for the past 14 months, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> data show. The low rates have helped the housing market, which is showing signs of strengthening. Home prices were up 5.5% in November year-over-year, <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case- Shiller data showed this week. New and existing home sales are also up. That is helping the overall economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If the economy is getting better, slightly higher interest rates are a natural occurrence," says Keith Gumbinger, vice president of mortgage tracker HSH.com. "But there's no reason to believe that rates are headed upward in a straight line."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2013-01-31-Homes-for-sale-are-in-short-supply-despite-rising- prices0_ST_U.xml</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">^$^The supply of homes for sale has been shrinking for six months and shows no improvement this month -- a bad sign for buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Listings of existing homes for sale were down 14% year-over-year in the first two weeks of January, according to Realtor.com, which tracks 146 markets nationwide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Phoenix, where prices were up 24% in November from a year earlier, new listings through the first three weeks of January were the lowest in 13 years, says Mike Orr, real estate expert at the W.P. Carey School of Business at <span class="companylink">Arizona State University</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That means "prices need to go up more" to bring more sellers to market, Orr says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, the supply of existing homes for sale fell to 4.4 months in December, based on the current monthly sales pace, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> says. That's the lowest in more than seven years. A six-month supply is considered balanced between buyers and sellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in November were 7.4% higher on average than a year earlier, according to <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>. Real estate experts had expected that rising prices would spur more sellers trapped by years of falling prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, January's listing data "is the same sad story," says Glenn Kelman, CEO of online brokerage Redfin. If sellers don't have to sell, "They're holding on, thinking they'll wait for prices to go up even more."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Redfin's data, covering 19 major markets, mostly in the West, show new listings down 29% the first two weeks of January vs. a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scarce sellers aren't the only reason for shrinking supplies. There are fewer distressed properties for sale. Foreclosure sales were down 7% through the first nine months of last year from the same period in 2011, RealtyTrac says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, demand is up. Existing home sales were up 9.2% last year, NAR's preliminary data show. New home sales rose almost 20% in 2012, the government reported Friday, while supply fell to 4.9 months in December from 5.4 months a year before. New home construction is still weak. In each of the past three years, builders completed fewer than 500,000 single-family homes. That's less than half the number built annually from 1993 to 2007, according to the Census Bureau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders would need to double production this year to alleviate the tight supply, estimates Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist. That's not likely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home supplies nationally will stay at about the five-month level much of the year, Yun predicts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some markets are far below that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California's supply of existing single-family homes for sale stood at 2.6 months in December, the <span class="companylink">California Association of Realtors</span> says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether the supply of homes for sale will expand to meet demand is a "big question for the market" in 2013, says Jed Kolko, economist for real estate website <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year is also the first since the housing bust began that falling inventories are not necessarily a good thing, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Listings may still swell in time for the busy spring selling season, says Stan Humphries, Zillow economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He says listing activity next month will be key. If it doesn't pick up by then, the spring season is likely to bring a lot of price increases, he says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales are set to keep marching upward this year after hitting their highest level in five years in 2012, economists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales for the full year rose 9.2% from 2011, according to preliminary data, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> (NAR) reported Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home sales, which will be reported Friday, have also been improving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing is finally contributing to the economy's growth instead of pulling it down, <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He expects housing to contribute a fifth of the economy's growth this year. In 2009, it subtracted more than 1 percentage point from GDP growth, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing has historically led the U.S. economy out of recessions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now that housing appears to be mending, with prices rising and more new construction, "the recovery will start to feel more normal," says David Crowe, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home sales are especially important to the economy because buyers spend money on other items, such as furnishings, appliances and landscaping.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising home values also increase household wealth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">December's existing-home sales, down 1% from November to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.94 million, were almost 13% higher than a year earlier, the NAR says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month's numbers were weaker than expected, but "the trend is still up," says Liz Ann Sonders, <span class="companylink">Charles Schwab</span> chief investment strategist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales -- and prices -- are being driven higher by:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low interest rates. Average interest rates for 30-year-fixed loans have been below 4% for the past 14 months, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Job growth. The unemployment rate stood at 7.8% in December, down from its peak of 10% in fall 2010. A better job market is helping more people move out of friends' and relatives' homes into their own. Net household formations topped 1 million in each of the past two years, Sonders says. That's more than twice the level of 2009 and 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all economists see brighter days ahead for housing, given what market researcher <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> says was a 7.4% jump in home prices in November from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher taxes and cuts in government spending, along with still- tepid job growth, will weigh on the market this year, says Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist for Mizuho Securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You've probably already seen the best of the housing recovery," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">---</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signs of improvement</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Changes in existing home sales in 2012</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">+9.2%</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total sales vs. 2011. Total sales -- including single-family homes, condos and co-ops -- were the highest since 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">+11.5%</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Change in December median price vs. December 2011. The median existing-home price for all housing types rose in December for the 10th straight month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-8.5%</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drop in number of homes available for sale in December vs. November. There is a 4.4-month supply of homes for sale at the current sales rate, lowest since May 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">+24%</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The share of December sales that were foreclosures or short sales. So-called distressed sales fell from 32% of all sales in December 2011.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Major real estate investors are buying fewer homes in some hot markets while expanding in others as they race against rising prices to turn more distressed homes into rentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phoenix, which has led the nation with rapid home-price gains, is among the first markets to see investors' interest cool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The percentage of Phoenix homes bought by investors fell to 28% in November after cresting at almost 36% in August and is now on a "clear downward" trend, says Mike Orr, real estate expert at the W.P. Carey School of Business at <span class="companylink">Arizona State University</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investor interest also may be close to "peaking" in some California markets where prices have risen rapidly, because higher acquisition prices cut financial returns, says John Burns, CEO of Burns Real Estate Consulting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, major investors are stepping up purchases elsewhere, especially in Southeastern cities such as Atlanta and Tampa. Home shoppers there are now seeing the multiple offers, bidding wars and shrinking supplies of homes for sale that occurred in Phoenix as investors swooped in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Phoenix-like phenomenon has migrated to other markets," says Sam Khater, economist for <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>. It says Phoenix home prices were up 24% in November year-over-year, vs. 7.4% for the nation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Major institutional investors are amassing a $10 billion war chest to pursue the single-family rental market, <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span> estimated in a recent research report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They're betting that they can get distressed homes on the cheap, fix them up and rent them out, often to families who lost homes to foreclosure, and make money on home price appreciation in a few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The companies generally seek three-bedroom, two-bath homes in the $100,000 to $125,000 range that can rent for more than $1,000 a month, analysts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With $10 billion to spend, that would roughly equate to 80,000 homes, although the investment funds continue to raise money, says <span class="companylink">JPMorgan</span> analyst Anthony Paolone. Nationwide, there are currently 12 million single-family rentals, most owned by mom-and-pop investors, Paolone says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big buying</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group</span>, for one, has spent $2.5 billion since early last year buying 16,000 homes. It's now adding 2,500 homes a month, it says. It's believed to be the biggest player in the group, but most are private, so information is limited.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colony Capital expects to invest up to $150 million a month this year to acquire single-family rentals. It bought 5,000 homes last year, it says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Waypoint Homes</span>, one of the market's pioneers, expects to own 10,000 homes by year's end. It started four years ago in the San Francisco Bay Area and owns 3,300 homes, says managing director Doug Brien.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like many of the big investors, <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> started investing in Phoenix.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It next moved into California, then Atlanta, Tampa, Orlando, Chicago, Las Vegas and Charlotte.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> has accelerated its buying because home prices have risen faster than it expected, says Jonathan Gray, <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span>'s head of real estate. In some markets, the window to buy before prices rise too much "is closing faster" than in others, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colony, for instance, has slowed purchases in Phoenix. Consultant Burns says Atlanta may be the hottest investor market now. Local real estate experts are seeing the impact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors "are a significant force in the market right now," says Mike Prewett, president of Southern REO Associates in Atlanta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prewett estimates that investors are buying 40% of foreclosed homes in the Atlanta area, triple the level of a year ago. Almost all foreclosures for sale draw multiple offers, often 10 or more, Prewett says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tampa, too, has seen an uptick, Realtors say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year ago, $125,000 homes in foreclosure could have been purchased "all day long," says Brad Monroe, managing broker for Prudential Tropical Realty in Tampa. "Now, there's 16 offers on each one of them within two days," many from cash-paying investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tampa's inventory of homes for sale in December stood at 3.3 months, based on the pace of sales. That was about half its level of a year earlier, data from the Greater Tampa Association of Realtors show. Generally, a six-month supply is considered a balanced market between buyers and sellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atlanta's November home prices were up almost 5% from a year ago. Tampa posted a similar gain, <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lure of deep slumps</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Institutional investors have largely circled cities that were hardest hit by the real estate downturn that started in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Phoenix, home prices fell almost 60% from their pre-bust peak before they started to recover. Las Vegas posted a similar drop. Tampa dropped almost 50%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The markets have more going for them than just cheap home prices. Phoenix, Tampa, Atlanta and Las Vegas -- all markets where investor buyers are busy -- have seen positive year-over-year job growth since July 2011. That will help drive housing demand, <span class="companylink">JPMorgan</span> says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first task for investors is to buy at the right price. In many hard-hit markets, prices have bounced faster than anyone anticipated even a year ago. That's made good buys harder to find, says Rick Sharga, executive vice president at Carrington Mortgage Holdings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent months, Carrington has slowed its buying in single- family rentals, Sharga says. "As prices go up, it gets harder for investors to get the returns they're looking for."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his report, analyst Paolone also warned that too many investors shopping in the same areas will drive prices up and eat into rental returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Burns says that's already happening in some places. Single- family rentals that returned 10% annually three years ago may now be running closer to 6%. That's too low for some investors, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, investors purchased 19% of homes in November, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> says, down from 23% of sales in January and February of last year. December data will be out today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NAR economist Lawrence Yun says the percentage of homes being purchased by investors might decline more this year as regular home buyers make up more of the market, assuming a continued economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Burns' data show investors accounting for much higher levels of total home sales in some cities. It also shows a leveling off or decline in recent months in the share of homes bought by investors in a variety of markets, including Tucson; Oakland; Tacoma, Wash.; Minneapolis; Washington, D.C.; and Durham, N.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Burns also says a peak may be near for Sacramento and Riverside. Both California cities have seen home prices rise faster than the national average, <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In November, Sacramento prices were up almost 13% year-over- year. Riverside's were up 10%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tight inventories will also slow investors, Burns says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Sacramento, the inventory of homes for sale fell to 1.6 months in December, based on the pace of sales, the California Association of Realtors says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These guys (investors) have bought up everything that's worth buying in many of the hardest-hit markets," Burns says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The value of good timing</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if investors slow purchases in a city, they may circle back around, says Waypoint's Brien.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Waypoint was late to get to Phoenix, starting purchases there only last year. But as competitors have slowed buying there, Waypoint has seen "a little bit better buying opportunity," Brien says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He expects the same thing to happen elsewhere. Investors will pull back when prices rise too fast, then return when price gains slow, as more people list homes for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's a lot to buy and a lot to buy attractively," says Justin Chang, Colony Capital principal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While investor buyers have helped prop up prices, they're making it tougher for regular home shoppers to compete.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom and Cyndi Vander Ven have been shopping for a home in Atlanta since September. The retired couple, both teachers, want to downsize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They've lost out on three bids so far, even though they offered more than the asking price. Their Realtor told them investors had outbid them, Tom Vander Ven says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They would have made more offers by now, but other homes they see listed are sold "before we can even move on them," he says.</p>

</div><div class="author">Paul Davidson   </div><div>Paul Davidson, @PDavidsonusat, USA TODAY</div>
<div>553 words</div><div>17 January 2013</div><div>USA Today (Newspaper)</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.5</div><div>English</div><div>© 2013 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nation's economy proved surprisingly resilient the past six weeks despite the budget standoff in Congress, with activity expanding in all 12 <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> districts, the Fed said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed's beige book report said the New York and Philadelphia Federal Reserve bank districts have rebounded from the near-term effects of Superstorm Sandy, and the pace of growth picked up in the Boston, Richmond and Atlanta regions while slowing in St. Louis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, uncertainty among businesses because of the so-called fiscal cliff of tax increases and spending cuts -- which was partially resolved early this month -- dampened the retail outlook in some areas and prompted some employers to hold off hiring. And the economic slowdown in Europe hampered some manufacturing exports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer spending increased across the country, but holiday sales were somewhat disappointing in the New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago and San Francisco districts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government figures released this week show holiday sales rose 2.7% over last year, far less than the 5.5% pace of 2010 and 2011. Sales of clothing, shoes and furniture were brisk in Boston, while online sales were strong in San Francisco. But retail sales were flat in the Richmond area and the fiscal cliff dampened the outlook in the Philadelphia, Kansas City and Dallas regions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Auto sales, however, remain a bright spot, with sales steady or stronger in 10 districts. Tourism rebounded in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast following the storm. And tourism in Boston, Atlanta and San Francisco was bolstered by surging business and international travel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturing, however, was mixed, with six districts growing, three contracting and two reporting little or no change. Rising aerospace and chemical production fueled growth in the Boston, San Francisco and Dallas districts. And the resurgent auto and housing sectors helped support manufacturing in Chicago and Philadelphia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But uncertainty about the fiscal cliff tempered growth in the Richmond area. And steel and auto production slowed in Cleveland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, however, manufacturers were optimistic about coming months in New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Minneapolis and Kansas City. The Fed separately reported Wednesday that manufacturing output rose 0.8% in December following a 1.3% gain in November, capping the best two-month stretch of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market also continued its comeback, with activity increasing and prices rising in most districts. Low interest rates and affordable prices sparked home sales in Boston. Still, the hotter market is creating some bottlenecks, with Kansas City reporting higher lumber and drywall costs that limited construction. In New York, the storm initially disrupted construction activity, "but this has since led to increased work for subcontractors on repairs and reconstruction."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commercial space leasing was more tepid, however, with Boston real estate officials reporting a drop in activity due partly to the fiscal cliff and demand for commercial real estate loans softening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The budget standoff also caused some employers to delay hiring, particularly in Boston, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City and San Francisco. Companies in Chicago that do business with Europe also scaled back hiring plans. And the new health reform law prompted businesses in Atlanta and Kansas City to put off adding staff.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing stocks nailed it for investors in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signs of a housing recovery that may finally stick catapulted home builder <span class="companylink">PulteGroup</span> to the top of the performance charts. Pulte shares nearly tripled, rising 188%, ranking it No. 1 out of the 500 large-company stocks that make up the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pulte, which sells homes under the brands <span class="companylink">Pulte Homes</span>, Del Webb and <span class="companylink">Centex</span>, and also issues home loans, has benefited from mounting signs the real estate market is on the rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales, housing starts and prices all improved in 2012, just as the number of foreclosures fell. In November, housing starts hit a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 861,000, the second-highest level since July 2007. Pending home sales rose to a level not seen since 2009-2010, when the government was offering incentives to first-time home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The more solid foundation in the housing market has also done wonders to rebuild shares of Lennar, the nation's largest home builder. Lennar, which ranked sixth best in 2012 returns, soared nearly 97%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other big winners in 2012 include <span class="companylink">Sprint Nextel</span>, the nation's third-largest wireless carrier, up 142%. The telecommunications company benefited from the massive shift to smartphones and other handheld communications devices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whirlpool, which makes durable, big-ticket items such as refrigerators, freezers and dishwashers, gained 114%, thanks to an improving jobs market, the housing rebound and income gains for consumers. Similarly, online travel service provider <span class="companylink">Expedia</span> got a boost from the rebounding economy, as well as from travelers' willingness to spend money on non-discretionary things such as family vacations. Its shares rose 112%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> rose 109%. The big move partly reflects a rebound from a steep 58% drop in 2011. It also profited from the improving housing market, which has boosted consumer confidence and cut the number of underperforming and underwater mortgages. The financial sector was the best-performing of 10 S&amp;P 500 sectors, up nearly 25%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, there were big losers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Apollo Group</span> topped the loser list in the S&amp;P 500. The for- profit education provider fell 61%. The government has targeted Apollo and other for-profit educational institutions because of the high debt levels of graduates and students' relatively poor employment track record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Computer chip maker <span class="companylink">Advanced Micro Devices</span> tumbled 56% amid a tough environment for PCs in a tech world shifting rapidly to smartphones and tablets. Electronics retailer <span class="companylink">Best Buy</span> plunged 49% as it struggled to compete with online sales and shoppers' increasing use of the Internet to find deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another victim of the rapid shift toward handheld devices and tablets was computer maker <span class="companylink">Hewlett-Packard</span>, down 45%. <span class="companylink">J.C. Penney</span>, the department store retailer, lost 44%, amid concerns its new pricing strategy would not be a cure-all for declining sales in the hyper-competitive retail world.</p>

<div>993 words</div><div>28 December 2012</div><div>USA Today (Newspaper)</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.3</div><div>English</div><div>© 2012 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you've ever bought a new home, you know that the delightful ritual of closing -- wherein you write an enormous check to the bank, and swear to write a series of 360 large ones -- isn't the only spending you'll do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You'll also have to buy a lawnmower, and, most likely, stuff to grow a new lawn; a fence, to keep the dog on your lawn, not the neighbor's; new window treatments, so you can keep people on the lawn from looking in; new carpet, to hide previously hidden stains in the old carpet; new furniture, to go with the new rug; and a vast array of handymen to redo the repairs you did.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is why economists watch housing numbers so closely. Few things stimulate the economy as much as a home purchase. That's one reason to be cheerful about 2013, assuming Congress or another band of lunatics doesn't do anything to muck it up. Home prices are rising, and the housing market is recovering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2007-09 economic meltdown was both a financial crisis and a housing crisis. The two are joined at the hip, although banking crises are depressingly predictable. About every 10 years or so, banks decide that the immensely profitable business of banking isn't profitable enough, and make reckless investments. When those investments collapse, banks get bailed out by the federal government, and spend the time until the next crisis complaining about crippling government regulation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the early 1980s, banks collapsed over high-risk energy loans, which toppled Continental Illinois, the original too-big-to-fail bank. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, it was bad real estate loans, which destroyed the savings and loan industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the most recent outbreak of banking insanity, banks made stupefyingly bad housing loans, and sold them to investment banks, which packaged them and sold them to investors, many of whom should have known better. The Treasury and the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank</span> have spent the past five years rescuing those banks, who are already complaining about excessive federal regulation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing part was fueled by the widespread belief that housing prices never fall. Investors had seen the stock market plummet 45% from 2000 through 2002, and lost faith in financial markets, especially tech stocks, many of which evaporated altogether. But housing had enjoyed a spectacular rise, offsetting some devastation from the stock market crash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Furthermore, for many families, housing was the last asset that they could tap to maintain their standard of living. The days of one- earner families had evaporated in the 1970s and 1980s; by the 2000s, two incomes weren't cutting it, either. As interest rates fell, it made sense -- in a way -- to finance a car or addition with a home- equity loan, rather than with non-existent savings. So-called cash- out refinancings boomed, as did home-equity lines of credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the housing boom went bust, it did so in a big way. The Case- Shiller housing index fell about 35% from its peak in July 2006 through its lows in early 2012. For anyone who bought after 2003 or so, the decline in home prices has been devastating. If you put $40,000 down on a $200,000 home that falls 35% in price to $130,000, you've lost 100% of your investment. Sell for anything less than the mortgage, and you have to write a check for the balance; unlikely, if you don't have savings or if you lost a job in the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing recessions, unlike stock recessions, take a long time to work out. It takes time to sell a house in a bad market, and therefore, a long time to reduce the inventory of unsold houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there's good evidence that housing, at last, is turning around, and much of the credit goes to the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>, which has doggedly held interest rates low. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 3.37%, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, a level that's just above its all-time low of 3.31%, set in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the Case-Shiller index indicates relatively low prices, the general trend has been up, and that reflects demand for new housing. New housing permits were up 31% in October from the same time in 2011, the Census Bureau says. New homes mean more jobs in the battered construction industry, as well as manufacturing jobs for those who make building materials. More jobs mean more people are able to buy houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How can you invest in the housing resurgence? First, bear in mind that if you own a house, you probably have enough exposure. But if you think housing has a future, consider:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lumber. The price of 1,000 board feet of framing timber is $356.50 on the CME futures exchange, up from $249.30 a year ago. <span class="companylink">Guggenheim Timber ETF</span> (CUT) invests in timber stocks; it's up 17.9% this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Concrete. There's no concrete ETF, but Cemex (CX) is the world's largest cement producer. You'd better believe earnings will rise to buy the stock at its current price. But if construction does improve, earnings will soar, and the stock should do well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REITs. Real estate investment trusts, or REITs, invest in commercial properties -- apartments, offices, storage units. REIT dividends are already taxed at ordinary income tax rates, so they should be somewhat immune from any fiscal-cliff-related tax increases on dividends. The average equity REIT yields about 3.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any bet on a housing rebound depends on a rising economy, and currently, the economy is being held hostage by our elected officials. Should Congress resolve the fiscal cliff, however, the prospects of a housing rebound seem bright -- and so do prospects for the stocks that might prosper from that rebound.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices rose 4.3% in the 12 months ended in October, according to a widely watched survey, outpacing analysts' expectations and underscoring a strengthening housing recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller index of 20 major cities, out Wednesday, dipped 0.1% in October from a month earlier. That was expected, given that home prices tend to be lower in fall and winter than in spring and summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Year-over-year trends are more meaningful. In 19 of the 20 cities surveyed, annual changes in October were higher than September, the data show. "It is clear that the housing recovery is gathering strength," said David Blitzer, chairman of the home price index committee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also says it's clear that housing is now contributing to the broader economy. Last week's final revision to third-quarter GDP showed that housing represented 10% of the growth while accounting for less than 3% of GDP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chicago and New York were the only two cities with negative-rate annual returns in October, down 1.3% and 1.2%, respectively, the Case-Shiller survey says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Phoenix, which has led the recovery, home prices rose for the 13th month in a row, posting an almost 22% one-year change. Detroit, which also fell severely during the downturn, posted a 10% annual gain. Minneapolis followed at 9.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home price increases are being driven by rising demand, strong investor interest, a shrinking inventory of homes for sale and fewer foreclosed properties, which tend to sell at a discount to others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of existing homes for sale fell in November to 4.8 months, based on the current pace of sales. That was the lowest level in more than seven years, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> reported last week. Realtors consider a six-month supply to be a balanced market between buyers and sellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, existing home sales grew last month to the highest level in three years, the NAR said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller numbers are similar to those reported by other home price trackers. Mortgage watcher Lender Processing Services reported Wednesday that its October home price index shows national home prices up 4.3% from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market helped pull the economy into recession in 2007, but it has emerged as a positive contributor for the past six quarters, government data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher demand and higher prices are inspiring more home builders. The <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> expects housing starts to be up 25% this year from 2011.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shrinking inventories of homes for sale, which have helped drive prices higher this year, may reverse course next year, economists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising prices are likely to persuade more people to sell and builders to add more homes, which would expand supplies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, with prices nationally down more than 30% from their 2006 peaks, the only people selling were people who had to sell, says economist Paul Diggle at Capital Economics. But prices have been rising, up 6.3% in October compared with a year earlier, <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> says. More increases are likely next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supplies of homes for sale are "close to a low point now," Diggle says and will "probably turn around over the next year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That will help keep a check on prices. Still, Capital Economics predicts prices will rise 5% next year. Economists surveyed by market watcher Zillow foresees a 3.1% jump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market continued to show signs of strengthening in November, with existing home sales climbing to their highest in three years, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> reported Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total sales of existing homes rose 5.9% in November to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.04 million, up 14.5% from a year ago, the NAR said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, the most important number in the monthly report dealt with the supply of homes for sale, says economist Patrick Newport of IHS Global Insight. Supplies have fallen to the lowest in more than seven years, based on the current pace of sales. The NAR reported the supply fell to 4.8 months in November, down 38% from January 2011. Realtors consider a six-month supply to be a balanced market between buyers and sellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More people will likely step up to sell next year, assuming prices continue to rise, Newport says. "A lot of people have just been waiting."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phoenix, which leads the nation with a 25% rise in October prices year-over-year, saw its supply of active listings hit a low in June, then expand until December. That's a normal seasonal pattern for Phoenix, but more ordinary sellers are also likely tapping into rising prices, says Mike Orr, real estate expert at <span class="companylink">Arizona State University</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent survey also points to more sellers. <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>'s November National Housing Survey showed the share of consumers who say now is a good time to sell a home jumped 5 percentage points in November to 23%. That's the highest level since the survey began in June 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate website <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>, with <span class="companylink">Harris Interactive</span>, also recently surveyed homeowners and found that 22% of current homeowners said they're at least somewhat likely to sell their homes next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those most likely to sell are people who bought after 2009 and have seen prices rise, the survey showed. They will likely include "flippers" who buy distressed homes, fix them, then resell, says <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> economist Jed Kolko.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supplies of homes for sale have been tightening, given stronger sales and a reluctance among people to sell while prices were weak. Also, fewer distressed properties have been coming to market as the foreclosure crisis slowly abates.</p>

</div><div class="author">John Waggoner   </div><div>John Waggoner, @johnwaggoner, USA TODAY</div>
<div>291 words</div><div>19 December 2012</div><div>USA Today (Newspaper)</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.5</div><div>English</div><div>© 2012 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you yell "Bernanke!" when you step on a rake, you probably hate the low interest rates the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> has kept in place since 2008. But if you're a builder, you probably love them, and today's housing starts number should reflect the benefits of low interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed pushed short-term interest rates down to zero in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, which is why savings rates are so low, and why the Fed is so unpopular with savers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Fed has also been pushing long-term rates down, which means the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is now at 3.32%. If you were to buy a median-price home -- half higher, half lower -- at $186,100, your principal and interest payment would be $817 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those low mortgage rates mean more demand for houses. Maury Harris, economist at <span class="companylink">UBS</span> Investment Research, expects 900,000 housing starts for November, vs. 894,000 in October. Although that's a far cry from the average 2.68 million housing starts in 2006, it's also far better than the low of 554,000 in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More demand for housing means that prices of existing houses are rising, too -- and that, in turn, means that people can afford to sell their old homes and move up to new ones. All that buying and building, while good for homeowners and Realtors, also means more jobs in the hard-hit construction industry. And more jobs means that more people can afford homes -- a virtuous circle that, at least so far, shows no sign of becoming frothy.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economic impact of an improving home building industry was impossible to miss on Nutmeg Landing one recent morning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Near a bank of newly constructed homes, workers hauled in a truckload of windows, passing other trucks from a tree service, a tile company and a plumbing firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This Central California city has seen single-family home building bump up slightly this year, to about 280 homes, but that's far short of the 600 to 800 that were built annually leading up to the 2006 housing bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manteca's situation mirrors that of many cities. The pounding of hammers and the rumble of construction trucks are louder now in more neighborhoods as single-family home building rises from post-World- War-II lows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, single-family home starts will be up 25% this year from 2011, which was the worst in more than half a century, and they'll jump another 35% next year, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> predicts. The upturn is fueling optimism that home building will again aid the U.S. economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the industry's recovery -- if not derailed by another recession -- will be slow, will be more visible in some regions than others and will face challenges, given the industry's need to rebuild its workforce and supply of undeveloped lots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The industry is "getting better, but we were very ill, and the convalescence period will be very long," says David Crowe, chief economist with the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAHB reported Tuesday that its index of U.S. builder sentiment improved in December, reaching its highest level in more than six years. November housing starts, which the government will announce today, will provide more insight into the market. Economics consulting firm IHS Global Insight predicts a decline from October, but it says that's largely due to a monthly drop in the volatile multifamily sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, home builders are benefiting from the same improving conditions that are helping the existing home market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Job growth helped drive the unemployment rate down to 7.7% in November from its peak of 10% in the fall of 2010. That's fueling more housing demand as more people can afford to form households.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Improving sales and fewer foreclosures have thinned once-bloated supplies of homes for sale. That, too, is driving demand for construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based on October's selling pace, the nation's supply of new homes for sale was 4.8 months, down from 12 months three years ago. Existing homes for sale were at a 5.4-month supply in October, down 22% from a year ago, says the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's less supply across the board," says Bert Selva, CEO of Shea Homes, one of the nation's largest private new home builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising home prices have also convinced buyers that the housing market has hit bottom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After largely falling for six years, U.S. home prices were up 6.3% in October year-over-year, <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> says. New home prices are also up for the first time in six years. Crowe estimates they've posted a 2% to 4% gain this year. <span class="companylink">RBC Capital Markets</span> home building analyst Robert Wetenhall predicts they'll jump 4% next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers now see that homes are no longer "going to get cheaper tomorrow," says Martin Connor, chief financial officer of luxury home builder <span class="companylink">Toll Bros</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Toll Bros</span>. expects to deliver 3,300 homes this year, up from 2,600 last year, it says. Other builders are seeing similar bumps. <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton</span>'s new home sales were up 21% in fiscal 2012 from the year before, it reported last month. <span class="companylink">PulteGroup</span>'s home sales were up 27% in the third quarter vs. last year, it says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors smell opportunity</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The improved performance -- and outlook for builders -- has captivated investors. The Dow Jones U.S. Home Construction Index, which includes major builders, is up 82% for the year, vs. 15% for the S&amp;P 500 index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some optimism may be unwarranted, says MKM Partners home building analyst Megan McGrath. She says home builders face several obstacles that will slow their growth next year, even if the U.S. avoids a major economic bruise stemming from the fiscal cliff issues of higher taxes and greater spending cuts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One challenge is lot shortages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the dearth of land development since the housing bust, builders in some markets now seeing strong rebounds in home sales don't have ample supplies of new lots to support increased building, Crowe says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"No one has developed land in six years," McGrath says. Builders are now "running to catch up." She says it'll take at least a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lot situation is already resulting in higher prices. Lot prices are up about 25% for the year in parts of Northern California, 30% in Phoenix and 15% in parts of Denver and Orange County, Calif., <span class="companylink">Shea Homes</span>' Silva says. In those markets, the recovery has been relatively strong compared with other parts of the country, home price data indicate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, the inflation in lot prices appears to be broad-based. Nine of 10 builders around the country report increases in lot prices, according to a recent survey by <span class="companylink">John Burns Real Estate</span> Consulting. That's up from one in 10 builders about two years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're not worrying about whether we can sell houses anymore," says San Diego builder Ure Kretowicz of <span class="companylink">Cornerstone Communities</span>. Instead, builders are worried about finding lots for future building, he says. Lot prices in that city are up 30% in the past 18 months, Kretowicz says. Large and small builders are scrambling for them, and multiple offers are common.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Major builders are shopping in many areas. Pulte said in October that it increased its 2012 land-spending plans by $90 million to $1 billion. <span class="companylink">Toll Bros</span>. will spend $600 million on land this year. That's double last year's level, Connor says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Phoenix, where home prices rose 25% in October year-over- year, given strong investor interest, farm land intended for future housing has quadrupled in price in the past two years, says land broker Nate Nathan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Labor shortages will be a more pervasive problem than lot shortages, Crowe says. Both could drive home prices higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many workers left the industry because of the length of the downturn, and took jobs in more stable industries or returned to Mexico, he says. About 1.4 million home construction jobs have been lost since 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Atlanta, foundations for new homes recently have sat untouched for two to three weeks waiting for framing crews, says Stephen Palmer, manager of builder Home South Communities. Dallas builder Larry Craven says he's had to extend build times from 90 days to 110 for the same reason.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McGrath says the biggest impact from shortages of labor and finished lots will be most acute in Northern California, Phoenix, parts of Florida, Texas and Washington, D.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She says single-family home building will rise only 23% next year, because of labor and lot constraints, rather than 35%, as the NAHB predicts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lift for the economy</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The upturn in home building is already being reflected in national economic figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through the first three quarters of this year, residential investment accounted for 16% of the growth in the nation's gross domestic product, vs. 2% in the same three quarters of 2011, says University of California-Los Angeles, economist Edward Leamer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the same period in 2010, residential investment was a drag on the economy, Leamer says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're all feeling guardedly optimistic," that housing is becoming an engine of economic growth, says Stuart Gabriel, director of the Ziman Center for Real Estate at UCLA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all regions will see the same boost, says Jody Kahn, vice president at <span class="companylink">John Burns Real Estate</span> Consulting. It routinely ranks regions poised for home-building growth based on such measures as job growth, home price trends and home inventories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kahn's latest data show Southern California, the Southwest and Texas as having the strongest foundations to support home building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In general, those regions are seeing either the strongest job growth in the nation, the most rapid home price appreciation this year or the tightest home inventories, Kahn's data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Northwest and Florida are less well positioned, while the Northeast, Southeast and Midwest bring up the rear, Kahn says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Southern Florida ranks in the middle, in part because its job growth is slower than other regions. Its inventory of existing homes for sale is also relatively slim, Kahn's data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Northeast, meanwhile, has among the largest supplies of existing homes for sale, which hurts new home demand, and lackluster payroll job growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The comparison between Southern California and the Midwest is most telling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Southern California has seen a 1.7% gain in payroll job growth for the year through September, the Midwest has come in at just 1.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Southern California has about half the inventory of homes for sale as the Midwest. Meanwhile, its home prices are up much more -- 5% year-over-year in October, vs. a 3% jump in the Midwest, Kahn's data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anthony Pasquinelli, division manager for BNA Homes, sees a long road ahead for the Chicago market where BNA builds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in Chicago were down 2.3% in October year-over-year, while they rose nationally, <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> says. The metropolitan area also has more distressed home loans than the national average. Almost 11% are 60 or more days late, vs. 8% nationwide, says mortgage tracker Lender Processing Services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Distressed homes typically sell at a discount, providing tough competition for home builders. That won't end for years, Pasquinelli says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market is "better this year, but it's still awful," he says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower-priced homes, which fell the most in price during the housing bust, are showing more zip as the housing market strengthens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 12 months through October, the nation's least-expensive homes have seen prices rise 10%, vs. 7.6% for the most-expensive homes, market researcher <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The lower you go, the better the performance," says Mark Fleming, <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>'s chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other real estate research points to strengthening at the low end, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zillow's third-quarter data show the least-expensive homes up 1.7% in value from the second quarter vs. 1.8% for the most- expensive homes. The gap between the two used to be wider. Zillow's first-quarter 2011 data show the least-expensive homes down 2% from the prior quarter vs. a 1% drop for the most-expensive homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The bottom tier, which has been persistently weak, has now pulled even with the top tier," says Stan Humphries, Zillow economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Year-over-year, its data show the highest-priced homes were up 3.7% in October vs. 2.4% for the lowest-priced homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zillow breaks the market into three price buckets based on local prices. In high-priced San Francisco, a bottom-tier home for Zillow is under $338,950. In Phoenix, a bottom-tier home is under $99,650.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> separates the market into four price groups based on local medians. The two middle tiers were up more than 8% for the year through October, it says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Evidence that prices are rising at similar rates in all tiers suggests that a nascent housing recovery is "broad based in a lot of markets," says Patrick Newport, IHS Global Insight economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New strength in the market's low end has multiple drivers, including:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors. They buy cheaper homes because they're better money makers as rentals, Fleming says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phoenix is a hot investor market where rentals account for almost a third of sales, says economist and real estate consultant Elliott Pollack. The under-$150,000 market now has just a two-month supply of homes for sale vs. a 12-month supply for homes above $1 million, Pollack says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bottom-tier homes in Phoenix posted a 24% year-over-year gain in price in October, vs. a 17% rise for top-tier homes, Zillow says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fewer distressed sales. Distressed homes peaked at 33% of home sales in January 2009 but fell to 20% of sales in September, <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fewer distressed sales may affect prices more at the low end of the market because higher-income households have more financial means to avoid a distressed sale, Humphries says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy grew modestly in October and early November in nine of the nation's 12 <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> bank districts, but Superstorm Sandy dampened activity in the Northeast, the Fed said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed's beige book said modest growth was reported in the Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco districts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A "somewhat stronger increase in activity" was noted in the St. Louis and Minneapolis regions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report said the economy weakened in New York, Philadelphia and Boston, at least partly because of the storm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike most government statistical reports, the beige book, released every six weeks, provides an anecdotal snapshot of the economy based on interviews with businesses across the nation. The report is named for the color of its cover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report largely chronicles a continuation of recent trends, with consumer spending and the housing market improving modestly as rising home prices lift consumer confidence. In October, however, new home sales fell 0.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 368,000, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. Economists said the storm had only a small impact. Sales the previous month were revised down sharply</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, uncertainty about Congress' ability to avert the looming tax increases and spending cuts known as the fiscal cliff have doused businesses' outlook. As a result, manufacturing and office leasing weakened, while the hiring outlook was mixed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York, consumer spending looked robust before the hurricane, and merchants expect to recoup sales as residents replace damaged property. Furniture sales picked up in the Boston and Chicago areas but fell in Cleveland. Electronics sales were tepid in Chicago, but consumer technology sales strengthened in San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news is that most regions were upbeat about holiday sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York retailers expect to recover sales washed out by the storm, while Boston businesses expect higher online sales. Still, possible tax increases due to the fiscal cliff prompted retailers in the Boston, Cleveland and Chicago areas to say they're uncertain about holiday sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hotel bookings, meanwhile, slowed in New York because of the storm, but "bounced back the next week." The hurricane devastated businesses in the Mid-Atlantic area. Convention activity in the Southeast, particularly Florida, picked up, though cruise line bookings were disappointing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market also continued to improve in most areas. The Cleveland and Richmond areas said sales were especially strong among high-price homes. Kansas City contacts said strong sales were reducing home inventories. But sales of both single-family homes and condos slowed in Boston and Philadelphia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, businesses in Dallas said they were "holding back on expansions due to uncertainty."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, hiring improved modestly in most districts, but Richmond staffing firms said some manufacturers were unwilling to hire the long-term unemployed. Large employers in Atlanta were looking to hire part-time, rather than full-time, employees. Chicago firms also said some companies "were putting hiring on hold."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wage growth, meanwhile, remained modest across most of the nation.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market, which was flat on its back for years after the financial crisis, finally appears ready to shed its image as an anchor on the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like a mason rebuilding a foundation brick by brick, data point after data point related to housing point to a broad-based recovery. The latest evidence that housing is transitioning from an economic headwind to a tailwind arrived Tuesday, when the closely watched S&amp;P/ Case-Shiller index showed a 3.6% year-over-year jump in housing prices last quarter. That was its biggest price jump since 2010's second quarter. The <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span>'s house price index also rose for the eighth month in a row in September. That data follow last week's strong readings on October existing home sales and housing starts. Up next: October new home sales are out today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We expect this trend to persist into next year as part of a broad-based housing recovery," said <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> economist Cooper Howes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Helping housing: low interest rates, dwindling inventory and an improving job market and economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street strategists, such as Ed Yardeni of Yardeni Research and Tobias Levkovich of <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span>, have recently highlighted the housing rebound as a bright spot for Wall Street. Last December, Levkovich cited a housing turn as a key plank in his future "Raging Bull Thesis." A healthy housing market boosts consumer confidence, and rising confidence correlates with rising stocks, <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> data since 1990 show.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lauren Vance has been shopping for her first home near Sacramento for five months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 26-year-old police officer lost 13 bids in a competitive market marked by strong investor interest and a tight supply of homes for sale. Given price increases, she has also had to pursue smaller homes to stay inside her budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost 2,800 miles away in Jacksonville, homeowners Amanda and Chris Dean would like to buy a bigger home. But they haven't been able to sell theirs for enough money to finance a new purchase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're at a standstill," says Amanda Dean, 26.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Welcome to the dichotomy that is the U.S. housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Six years since the start of the greatest housing collapse since the Great Depression, one doesn't have to look very far to see signs of a recovery. Nationally, home prices are rising after more than a 30% drop since mid-2006. More good news arrived Tuesday, as the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller home price index reported third- quarter prices were up 3.6% from a year ago, and September's 20- city index reached its highest level in two years. Foreclosures have slowed in most of the country after having decimated hundreds of U.S. cities. Rather than being a drag on the U.S. economy, housing is now seen as a contributor to growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"With six months of consistently rising home prices, it is safe to say that we are now in the midst of a recovery in the housing market," said David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S&amp;P.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet there's a reason housing experts and economists won't yet pop the cork on the champagne. Just as the housing bust hit some areas harder than others, the recovery has been kind to some cities while unforgiving in others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the national numbers, prices aren't rising everywhere. The still-shaky economy fuels other concerns, particularly threats of recession due to the looming "fiscal cliff."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's almost a ZIP code by ZIP code recovery," says Stan Humphries, Zillow chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's better now?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zillow's data show that 183 of 252 markets nationwide hit bottom in the third quarter, after years of largely falling, and probably won't fall more. Prices were still falling in the other 69 markets, Zillow says. Yet on a national basis, 140 economists recently surveyed by Zillow predicted home prices would rise an average 15.2% from the end of last year through 2016, or from 2.3% to 3.4% a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More-bullish economists, including John Burns of <span class="companylink">John Burns Real Estate</span> Consulting, see prices rising 5% to 7% a year through 2016. If so, they'd far exceed the average 3.65% a year growth in prices that defined the national housing market from 1988 to 2000 -- before the housing bubble started to form, Zillow says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Burns argues that the housing sector has more tailwinds than headwinds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Case-Shiller's index of 20 leading cities showed September prices up 3% year-over-year, with increases in 17 of the cities on an annual basis, led by Phoenix at 20%, annual prices largely flat in Atlanta and down in Chicago and New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes are also up, by 11% in October from the same month last year. Meanwhile, the supply of homes for sale has fallen to the lowest in a decade, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> says. That should help prices. New home sales are also doing better. After touching a record low in 2011, they increased 4% in the third quarter from the second, IHS Global Insight reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond the sales and price trends, economists say housing has some strong drivers, including:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Affordability. Housing is the most affordable it has been in decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Credit the fall in home prices and low interest rates. The U.S. average for a 30-year fixed mortgage hit a record low of 3.31% as of Nov. 21, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even Robert Shiller, the famed <span class="companylink">Yale University</span> economist who helped create the Case-Shiller index, says it's a good time to buy, assuming someone really wants to be a homeowner vs. a renter: "It's very affordable if you want that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, home affordability has improved an average of 35% since the 1985-2000 period, Zillow says, based on home price and income data in 143 major U.S. markets. Consumers now spend an average 13% of their monthly gross incomes on mortgage payments vs. 20% historically. In mid-2006, at the height of the housing boom, it was 24%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alison and Nicholas Arnold of Wilmington, N.C., recently bought their first home: a four-bedroom, 3.5-bath home for $372,000. Their market suffered a 31% decline in home values in the past five years, Zillow data show. The lower home prices and good interest rates enabled the couple to buy such a big home, says Alison Arnold, a 28- year-old health coach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We wanted something we could grow into," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices. Rising prices are convincing buyers that it's time to act.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Consumers now recognize that houses are not going to get cheaper tomorrow," says Martin Connor, chief financial officer of home builder <span class="companylink">Toll Bros</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jose Frausto, 37, a second-grade school teacher in Whittier, Calif., says he timed his first home purchase just right. The lifelong renter, along with his wife, Gabriella, 35, recently bought a $343,000 four-bedroom, one-bath home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fraustos started shopping in late spring. By the time they purchased, similar homes had risen in price by $10,000, Jose Frausto says. Median home prices in the area fell 36% from 2006 through 2010, <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span> data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think I got in at the right time," Jose Frausto says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if home price gains slow from their current pace, the fact that they're not falling will help get more buyers into the market, says Glenn Kelman, CEO of online brokerage Redfin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stronger economy. The nation's unemployment rate dropped to 7.9% in October from its peak of 10% in the fall of 2009. Employed people buy homes and are less likely to default on loans. Stock prices are up despite recent jitters about the fiscal cliff. The Conference Board reported Tuesday that consumer confidence in November was the highest in 41/2 years and that 6.9% of those surveyed said they plan to buy a house within six months. That's the highest percentage in two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the economy improves, more people form households, which drives housing demand. In 2008, household formation fell to one- fourth its historical level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, it's clawed back to about half its historical level, says economist Humphries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of those new households are likely to be home buyers instead of renters, given the rising cost to rent and the diminished cost to own, says Jed Kolko, chief economist of real estate website <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 100 large metro areas, the average cost of owning a home is 45% cheaper than renting, Kolko's data show. That includes the tax benefits of owning and assumes that someone lives in the house for seven years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Near the height of the housing bubble six years ago, it was 13% cheaper to rent than to own, Kolko's analysis shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's ahead?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite signs of strength, housing analysts who fear continued weakness say the market's recent uptrend lacks durability. Some economists worry that prices may resume falling if the U.S. suffers from the slowing global economy or the European debt crisis, or falls into recession from the combination of federal tax increases and spending cuts on tap in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While there's a good chance prices will go up from here, I'm still not ready to call the bottom," Shiller says. "There's such wishful thinking that it's all fixed. ... We have a lot of headwinds."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among them:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Underwater homeowners. Nationwide, 45% of the almost 50 million homeowners with a mortgage have less than 20% equity in their homes, <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If people can't sell homes and walk off with enough money to put down on a new home -- plus pay a Realtor's commission -- they won't sell, says Mark Hanson, an adviser to professional investors on housing and mortgage issues. If they don't sell, they won't buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High delinquency rates. Some markets also remain deeply mired in the foreclosure crisis. Nationwide, 11% of mortgages were 30 days or more delinquent or in foreclosure in September, according to mortgage tracker Lender Processing Services. Those percentages are far higher in states such as Florida and New Jersey where courts must approve foreclosures and they take months longer to complete.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those foreclosure pipelines will "weigh on the market" in those states and cities, economist Kolko says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Slight shifts in surging markets. Signs of cooling are emerging in some of the hottest markets, including Phoenix and Las Vegas, which were among the hardest hit during the foreclosure crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of 100 of the largest metropolitan regions, Phoenix posted the biggest price gain in September with a 22% year-over-year jump, <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> data show. Las Vegas came in fifth with an almost 11% increase. Both cities have seen strong interest from investor buyers, who are turning single-family homes into rentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But October single-family median sale prices were flat after eight months of increases, the <span class="companylink">Greater Las Vegas Association of Realtors</span> says. In Phoenix, big investors are showing less interest as bargains become tougher to find, says Mike Orr, real estate expert at <span class="companylink">Arizona State University</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hanson warns that the shifts in Phoenix, Las Vegas and parts of California foreshadow the beginning of the nation's "hangover" and lack of "durability" in this year's recovery. He says sales volume will fall off as investors, who have gorged on foreclosures for the past year, back off in the face of rising prices and limited supplies of houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Challenges for buyers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, shoppers such as Vance are navigating quick- moving markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When she began looking, she'd get 10 new listings to view each week in her $160,000 price range. In recent months, she got two or three.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given fewer foreclosures and high investor demand, the Sacramento area had just a 1.9-month supply of homes for sale in October vs. the six-month supply that Realtors generally consider to be a balanced market. As a result, Sacramento prices were up almost 7% in September year-over-year, <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vance is finally under contract to buy a home. But instead of getting one with three bedrooms, she's gone with two, says Rob Baxley, her Realtor. He's had only one other buyer this year who made more offers to win a home, and he sees no let-up in competition for lower-priced homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The market is getting tighter and tighter. For buyers in that price range, it's miserable," Baxley says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers can expect to pay more for beef next year as the effects of last summer's drought work through the food chain, but the <span class="companylink">U.S. Department of Agriculture</span> says price increases won't be as high as it expected earlier. The USDA now says beef prices will rise 3% to 4%, a percentage point lower than its October forecast. Food prices overall are also forecast to rise 3% to 4%, and that forecast is unchanged from October.</p>
