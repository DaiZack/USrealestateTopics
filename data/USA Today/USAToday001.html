<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite housing demand booming during the pandemic, foreign homebuyers in the U.S. have steadily declined for the fourth year in a row.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign buyers purchased $54.4 billion in existing U.S. homes from April 2020 through March 2021, a 27% decrease from the previous year and the lowest in a decade, according to a new report from the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">COVID-19 caused a decline in international business and tourism travel, limiting foreign purchases to 107,000 properties, down 31% from the previous year. Both dollar and sales volume are the lowest since 2011, when the figures totaled $66.4 billion and 210,800 properties sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign buyers who resided in the U.S. as recent immigrants or who hold visas to live in the states purchased $32.4 billion worth of existing U.S. homes, a 21% decrease from the year before. Foreign buyers who lived abroad made up the remaining $22 billion in sales, another decrease of 33%. As a whole, international buyers made up only 2.8% of the $5.8 trillion in existing-home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The big decline in foreign purchases of homes in the U.S. in the past year is no surprise, given the pandemic-induced lockdowns and international travel restrictions,” NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun said in a statement. “Yet, even with the absence of foreign buyers, the U.S. housing market strengthened solidly.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China, Canada, India, Mexico and the United Kingdom were the top five countries of origin by U.S. residential sales dollar volume. China and Canada hold first and second place in sales dollar volume at $4.5 billion and $4.2 billion. India stood at $3.1 billion, Mexico at $2.9 billion and the United Kingdom at $2.7 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each country saw a drastic drop of 50% in dollar volume from the previous year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The top U.S. destinations for foreign buyers were Florida, California, Texas, Arizona, New Jersey and New York. Florida has held the top spot for foreign buyers for the past 13 years and accounts for 21% of all international purchases. California stood at 16%, Texas at 9%, Arizona at 5% and New Jersey and New York at 4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost half, 43%, of foreign buyers purchase a property for a primary residence, with 49% of international buyers buying homes in the suburbs. Twenty-eight percent bought homes in urban areas, a figure that has stayed steady for six years. Only 7% bought property in resort areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“As travel restrictions loosen and foreign students return to U.S. colleges in the upcoming year, there is likely to be some growth in foreign buying of U.S. real estate,” Yun said.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tiffany Thompson decided that a year of working from her Los Angeles home with her husband was too much of a good thing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A change of scenery and the ability to be apart on occasion in a home away from home seemed appealing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plus, the Emmy-winning freelance TV producer and her husband, Chase Kopecky, an editor at ABC Network Television, had been saving money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I was making more money than normal because I was able to do multiple projects at once (with no travel) and just socking it all away," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, the couple started looking for homes in Palm Springs, a vacation destination in California's Coachella Valley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By April, they'd bought a one-bedroom, two bath condo in Indian Wells, a 21/2-hour drive from their home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"My husband is an avid golfer, so the place was perfect," says Thompson. "I love the restaurants in the area and its proximity to the Joshua Tree National Park."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thompson and Kopecky are among a growing number of Americans plunking down money to buy a second home. They are aided by equity gains in their primary home due to soaring home prices, historically low mortgage interest rates, improved savings accounts and a flexible work environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales surge for vacation homes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes in counties with at least a 20% share of vacation homes rose by 24% on average in 2020, more than double the 11% increase in counties that don't have a large volume of vacation homes, according to a National Association of Realtors report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, vacation homes are the hottest segment of the hot pandemic housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors defines "vacation home counties" as ones where vacant homes for seasonal, occasional, or recreational use account for at least 20% of the housing stock. As of 2019, about 10% of the roughly 3,000 counties across the country were vacation home counties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vacation home sales rose by nearly 17% in 2020 and by 33% year-over-year between January and April 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     Lawrence Yun, the National Association of Realtors' chief economist, said he expects vacation homes to remain a popular segment of the housing market given the continued work from home policies of many companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That reality stands in sharp contrast to the many would-be first-time buyers of primary homes who have been shut out of the market due to a lack of inventory and soaring prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, economists say the increase in demand for vacation homes – which tend to be in beach towns, golf resorts, or ski towns – doesn't necessarily mean it's eating into the first-time homebuyer market, largely dominated by millennials focused on good school districts in the suburbs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One piece of evidence is the lack of frenzied bidding wars in vacation home counties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2020, properties in vacation home counties stayed on the market for 59 days compared with 30 days in non-vacation home markets. And in some overheated markets like Phoenix and Los Angeles, sellers are receiving several offers – with some being tens of thousands of dollars above list price – the day of or a few days after a home goes on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage applications for second homes soared 84% year over year in January, down from a peak 118% year-over-year increase in September, according to Redfin, a full-service real estate brokerage where sellers pay a discounted fee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's been a pretty massive financial windfall for homeowners and a number of those homeowners have turned to buy second and vacation homes," said Taylor Marr, lead economist at Redfin. "The changing nature of work really makes the economics of owning a vacation home much more viable if you can get more use out of it by working out of it for a week or two out of the year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second homes also could be a good investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's now much easier to buy a second home and have part of that cost offset by short-term rental," says Marr. "That's also created more demand for these second homes for those who can afford them."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amar Mehta, a partner at Ernst and Young who lives in Manhattan, rented summer homes for a week or two in Nantucket, Massachusetts, since 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But over the years, Mehta says he found himself spending close to a month on the island with his wife and two young kids.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a nice, peaceful environment," he says. "You can fly up there in an hour or drive or take the ferry."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While he skipped his trip last year, he signed a lease for this summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, Mehta says he was looking for a home to buy. Then in January, he found a three-bedroom home near the beach and offered $10,000 above the asking price to clinch the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mehta says he plans to spend more time in his Nantucket home and has rented the property out in the weeks he'll be away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We had someone offer 33% more than what we were asking in rent for a week we had planned to be there."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back on the West coast, Vlad Roytapel, a Redfin agent in Palm Springs, said he was seeing an influx of buyers from Southern California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I really do believe that's because of the decrease in flights and people feeling uncomfortable to travel by plane, but they still want to travel," he says. "And they are buying it for a combination of personal use and as short-term rental property."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Upper Peninsula, most people buying cottages in the popular vacation destination in northern Michigan tend to have some local connection, said Stephanie Jones, a real estate agent in Marquette, which has experienced a spike in demand and prices over the last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said the pandemic has forced people to reevaluate what's important.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think a big part of the increase is: 'I can work remotely even if, just part of the time.' So I want to be someplace that makes my soul happy," she says. "And one of the things about the Upper Peninsula is it is an incredibly beautiful location."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Thompson, the TV producer, the pandemic helped crystalize her plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It forced us to look at our finances and our future, and we decided what better investment than real estate in California, right?" she says. "Sometimes you need a break from your home even if you're still working from home."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices soar in april at fastest pace since 2005</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home prices soared in April at the fastest pace since 2005 as potential buyers bid up prices on a limited supply of available properties. The S&amp;P <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> Case-Shiller 20-city home price index, released Tuesday, jumped nearly 15% in April from the previous year. That is up from a 13.4% annual gain in March. All 20 cities that make up the index reported higher year-over-year price gains in April than the previous month. Five – Charlotte, Cleveland, Dallas, Denver, and Seattle – had the largest 12-month price increases on records back 30 years.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">National home prices have grown by about 15% over the past year, giving homeowners greater equity and financial security.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, rising prices have helped drive an increase in cash-out refinancing, where homeowners refinance to a lower mortgage interest rate while also taking money out by tapping into their increased home equity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, according to <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> data, last year approximately $185 billion of equity was extracted through cash-out refinances – the most since 2007, right before the Great Financial Crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many cases, a cash-out refinance makes sense, allowing a family to cover a medical emergency or a longer-term investment such as college tuition or a home renovation. But cash-out refinances can also carry risks that every homeowner – and every lender – should consider, especially during times of rapid home price increases such as now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Risks of quick cash</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first risk is simple. Home prices go up, and they go down. We've seen several cycles over the past few decades where home prices in many major markets dropped significantly. If a home's value falls below the loan's value, the borrower's equity evaporates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second risk is using a home's equity for quick cash instead of a cushion or a tool for building wealth. In a worst-case scenario, a homeowner might decide to use the family home as an ATM machine, taking out large amounts of money and making a risky assumption that housing prices will keep going up indefinitely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between 2005 and 2007, in the run-up to the Great Financial Crisis, millions of borrowers extracted equity from their homes, fueled by skyrocketing prices, lax lending standards and speculative investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Irresponsible lenders profited, but borrowers had to live with the fallout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Caution but not alarm</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result was a tragic spiral of underwater mortgages, foreclosures and bankruptcies for families – and instability and weakness for the broader economy that took years to recover from. The financial health of some borrowers caught in that economic spiral has never recovered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, thanks to more responsible lending standards, many of the factors that led to the 2008 crisis are not present. The financial industry has learned many lessons from that time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, for example, now requires that cash-out refinance loans be no greater than 80% of the home's value. We also require at least six months of verified reserves for homeowners whose monthly debt payments are 45% or more of their monthly incomes. These standards help protect consumers and the housing finance system against risks such as falling home prices or economic shocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, the overall picture of today's cash-out refinance market is one calling for caution, but not alarm. According to <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, only 36% of 2020 refinances resulted in a new mortgage balance that was at least 5% greater than the previous balance. Compare this with 78% of refinances from 2005 to 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As home prices continue to rise, however, the temptation to push the envelope will likely grow for both lenders and homeowners. Homeowners considering a cash-out refinance need to keep a few key facts in mind:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A mortgage is secured by your home. Unlike credit cards and many other loans, missing the monthly payments on your cash-out refinance loan could cost you your home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Refinancing is not free. Typically, closing costs run from 2% to 5% of the loan amount, skimming off some of the homeowners' equity. In addition, while <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> won't back a cash-out refinance loan with less than 20% equity, if a homeowner and lender choose to go that route, the homeowner should expect an annual mortgage insurance premium of 0.40% to 2.50% of the loan balance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices can fall. No one knows for certain where housing prices are headed. Anyone who says otherwise might not have your best interest at heart. <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> economists believe that home prices will continue to grow through the end of 2022. But that's just our projection, and if you enter into a cash-out refinancing assuming it's a certainty, you could be putting your home at risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Houses require upkeep. Roofs need to be repaired. Aging appliances need to be replaced. Maintenance costs can be expensive. By preserving home equity, families have a resource they can tap to make needed investments in their homes to maintain and enhance their property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are other refinance options. A non-cash-out refinancing that lowers your interest rate can lower your monthly house payment, taking pressure off your budget. A refinancing that shortens your term can help you build equity faster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These facts underscore one overriding truth: Homeownership can be one of the most effective ways of building wealth. However, entering into a long-term mortgage and building equity requires care and diligence. But the payoff in the years to come can be tremendous, helping families weather financial shocks and save for things like retirement and even passing wealth on to children or grandchildren. Pulling cash out of a home puts those long-term benefits at risk, so weigh the costs, benefits and risks carefully.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amid a booming economy and rising inflation, the Federal Reserve this week could signal that it's likely to move up the timetable for withdrawing the extraordinary stimulus measures it has enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed meeting highlights a busy week of economic news that also features the latest data on retail sales and housing starts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Autos may crimp retail sales</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retail sales have been choppy lately, flatlining in April after a strong March fueled by government stimulus checks and a rebound from February's storms. The May report, out Tuesday, is expected to show overall sales fell 0.4%, dragged down by a drop in vehicle inventories because of lingering computer chip shortages, according to a survey of economists by Action Economics and <span class="companylink">PNC Financial Services Group</span>. But excluding vehicles, retail sales likely rose a solid 0.5%, according to the Action Economics survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer spending makes up almost 70% of the nation's gross domestic product. Americans are spending on things like clothing, sporting goods and dining out after the pandemic sharply curtailed their outlays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts may rebound</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts tumbled 9.5% in April to 1.57 million, driven by a slide in single-family home construction. Due to shortages of building materials and labor, residential construction has been delayed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A bounce-back is likely in May. Economists surveyed by Action Economics forecast that construction began on 1.65 million homes last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed may hint at earlier rate hike</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy has continued to show rapid progress amid rising vaccinations and falling COVID-19 cases, and consumer prices have jumped as demand has surged while supply-chain snarls have caused product shortages. Although the Fed believes the stronger inflation is temporary, the developments could lead policymakers to push up their median forecast for the first hike from the Fed's near-zero benchmark rate to 2023 from 2024 at the earliest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed also could signal that it may begin tapering its $120 billion a month in Treasury and mortgage bond purchases – which help hold down long-term interest rates, such as for mortgages – earlier than anticipated, says economist Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics. She expects the Fed to begin tapering the purchases early next year, with the Fed announcing the move at its August conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Fed Chair Jerome Powell needs to talk a fine line. With job gains disappointing the past two months because of worker shortages, the Fed likely hasn't achieved "substantial progress" toward its goals of maximum employment and stable inflation, Bostjancic says. Powell may simply say Fed officials discussed reducing the bond purchases without hinting at a timetable.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Nearly two-thirds of millennials have homebuyer regrets, new survey says</span>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this hot real estate market, competition for houses often leads to quick purchases which also can lead to buyer's remorse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to a recent Bankrate survey, 64% of millennials aged 25 to 40 are facing regrets after buying a home compared with 33% of baby boomers aged 57 to 75. The survey found that the older the buyer, the less likely they were to have homebuyer regret.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One factor that may explain this divide is desperation; younger homebuyers are more likely to rush into a purchase which can lead them to settle for properties that might not be to their liking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Factoring in the pandemic, the survey found that homebuyer regrets among millennials mainly fell into two categories: financial and physical.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where's the stock market headed? Here’s what the second half of 2021 could look like for your retirement investments</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners are missing out: 14.1M owners are not refinancing despite low rates. Should you refinance now?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financial regrets among homebuyers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 21% of homebuyers listed high maintenance costs as their biggest regret, and that number jumped to 26% among younger millennials aged 25 to 31. Maintenance refers to anything in the house that breaks and needs to be fixed or replaced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Hamrick, senior economist analyst at Bankrate, explained that as home prices have been rising nationally, there's a risk that people have less flexibility with their finances, and the only way to mitigate that is to avoid paying too much or have sufficient emergency savings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The No. 1 financial regret among Americans is that they wish they had emergency savings," Hamrick said. "You know, you look around the house and it's just a series of things waiting to break."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homebuyers should also go into a purchase with their eyes open, recognizing that maintenance will be required. Older homes might be in need of updated appliances, according to Jeffrey Harris, a professor at the department of finance and real estate at American University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 13% of homebuyers listed high mortgage payments as another concern, and 12% of homebuyers were unhappy with mortgage costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising house prices: Home prices rose by more than 50% in 10 markets since 2017</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buying a house in COVID: First-time buyers are struggling</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's at least some people who don't do sufficient homework, and so, you know, we always say it pays to shop around for the best rates and do additional homework," Hamrick said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given low interest rates nowadays, the cost burdens among millennial homeowners are largely due to the higher-than-expected price tags for their homes, according to Hyojung Lee, an assistant professor of housing and property management at <span class="companylink">Virginia Tech</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Admittedly getting and comparing rates across lenders is burdensome and time-consuming, but it is important as it will determine how much you will pay for the next several years, if not decades," Lee said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, about 13% of homebuyers listed overpaying as one of their concerns, and 9% of homebuyers did not think their home was a good investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The best way to avoid overpaying is to have a home inspection done before purchase — these inspections can uncover electrical problems, heating and cooling problems, termite issues, radon problems, and a host of other hidden issues that might not be readily apparent to the untrained eye," Harris said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Location regrets among homebuyers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the survey, about 15% of homeowners listed a bad location as one of their regrets for buying a house. Location could mean different things to different people, and some of these variables might include proximity to good schools, restaurants, cafés or parks, or even an issue with safety in the neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The problem is that when there is huge demand and limited supply, there would be more and more mismatch between the two so that people might not be happy with what they got. This could be problematic as you cannot easily change your neighborhoods," Lee said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cheaper homes also tend to be in less attractive locations. Since millennials and young homebuyers are likely on a smaller budget than older, more established buyers, millennials are likely to purchase these cheaper homes that might suffer from a location problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why can't companies find workers? Spurred by COVID, many launch businesses</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If a new buyer can only afford a suboptimal location, the home may still offer value if the buyer maintains the home well, makes consistent payments to build equity over time, and decides to upgrade or move to a more expensive location over time," Harris said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey also found that 14% of millennials said that their house was too big, and the same percentage said that their house was too small. According to Hamrick, people were not entirely happy with being in multifamily units during the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We saw a solid increase in single family home purchases where people were essentially looking to have more space that could be separated from other families but also have enough space in the home to accommodate working from home, including children who need to study from home," Hamrick said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you own a home in the top 10 metropolitan U.S. housing markets, it may be worth a lot more than what you paid for, even if you bought it just a few years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price of a home in these areas has jumped an average of 57% in the past four years, according to new data from Realtor.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's a feat that normally would have taken 10 years to achieve, Danielle Hale, the chief economist for Realtor.com, tells <span class="companylink">USA TODAY</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you are a somewhat recent owner, it might surprise you to learn that you could actually sell your home and make some money much sooner than you might have expected to," Hale says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Realtor.com looked at the 300 largest metropolitan areas and ranked them by how much their sale prices have climbed since 2017. The median time these listings stay on the market has dropped by 30 days, and these houses are now selling in 25 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leading the pack is Boise, Idaho, where the median price surged by 72% to $385,000 from $224,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market with the highest median price was the Stockton-Lodi, California, area at $460,000, a 51% increase from January-February 2017 to the same period in 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Affordability was a key factor in the markets that experienced price increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The largest price increases occurred near major Western cities that are tech hubs. Besides Boise, other hot metro areas with those characteristics include Spokane, Washington, and Ogden, Utah.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Boise is attracting a lot of people from major California markets like San Francisco and San Jose," Hale says. "The climate is similar, the prices are much more affordable, and it has lots of outdoor activities."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The list includes cites in Western, Midwestern and Southern states, including Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Indiana, North Carolina, Utah and Wisconsin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent survey by Realtor.com found that 10% of homeowners plan to list their homes this year, and more than a quarter (26%) plan to do so within the next three years. One of the biggest drivers was turning a profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the current seller's market, where multiple bids on houses are now the norm, 29% of would-be home sellers expect to set the list price above what they think the house is worth, the survey found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hale says it typically takes three to five years for a homeowner to get to a break-even point when the costs of buying make sense over renting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price for an existing single-family home soared 18.4%, to $334,500, in March, marking a historic high, according to the National Association of Realtors.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the start of the pandemic, Americans looking to buy a home have struggled with bidding wars and a limited number of houses for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But one area of the cutthroat real estate landscape is improving. It's the luxury segment, where listings are up and homes are selling at a rapid clip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The demand is so great that even "white elephants" – high-end homes that sat on the market for months before the pandemic began – are selling quickly as their owners willingly splurge on remodeling projects to spruce them up. The motivation is the hot market for premium properties, and an urge to make shabbier ones more alluring for buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a time of unprecedented shortages of available homes, improving sales of larger, high-end properties means that a few people are moving up the price ladder, and putting a limited number of less expensive houses on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When larger homes sell, it means it is freeing up inventory in mid-market homes," says Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the National Associated of Realtors. "There is a ripple effect, but it is small."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For owners willing to spend thousands to make high-end properties "move-in ready," those efforts are now often rewarded when buyers pay top dollar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JoJo Romeo, a real estate agent in Irvine, California, who specializes in luxury properties, has managed 12 such projects for sellers in the last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many cases, they were "white elephants."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Clients will say, ‘Oh the market’s really good. I want to get top dollar for my house,'” Romeo says. “And I say, ‘You’re not going to because it’s not turnkey.’”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Edward Li decided in June 2019 that he wanted to sell the five-bedroom home he’d owned with his parents in Irvine, California, for 13 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He listed the 3,600-square-foot property, which has a pool and is in the gated community of Turtle Ridge, for $3.49 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eight months later, Li still had no offers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That’s when Romeo contacted him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“She’s like, ‘What’s the situation with this house?'" recalls Li, an engineering business consultant. She then insisted that he remodel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"'We're catering to a high-end market where buyers just don't want to fix anything,'” he remembers her saying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Li agreed. The home had been rented for over a decade and had a stain on the carpet and beige walls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a $150,000 renovation, Romeo re-listed the home in July. It received three offers within the first week, then sold for $3.55 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A confluence of trends is fueling the revived demand for high-end homes like Li's. Affluent Americans want more space as they work, learn and entertain from home. They also have the means to buy, helped by higher savings, historically low mortgage rates and soaring stock prices that have padded their wealth and allowed them to offer large amounts of cash for new homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There's this heightened awareness of home and the high-net-worth individuals who were spending their time traveling are suddenly spending a lot of time at home,” says Diane Hartley, president of the Institute for Luxury Home Marketing in Dallas. “And now they want their homes bigger and better.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the start of the pandemic, stay-at-home orders prevented buyers from house-hunting and discouraged sellers from listing properties. But that changed in May 2020, when online, socially distanced viewings started taking off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the months that followed, demand far outpaced supply, and U.S. housing gained about $2.5 trillion in value for 2020 – the most in a single year since 2005, according to a Zillow analysis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People view real estate in a more special way than before and that is a change in preference we are seeing in all segments of the U.S. housing market," says Yun, the NAR economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fast forward to 2021. The typical luxury home on sale during the first quarter spent 61 days on the market – 38 fewer days than during the same period in 2020, according to Redfin. That compares with 26 fewer days for expensive homes, 18 fewer days for midpriced homes and 14 fewer days for affordable homes, according to Redfin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes that sold for more than $1 million rose by 81% in February, according to the National Association of Realtors. In the Midwest, the number doubled in the same period. In the Northeast, volume increased by 98%. In the South, it was up by 94%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not just pricey renovations like Li's that get results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patrick Ryan, a real estate agent in Chicago, spent $3,000 to fix up a single-family listing in the Wicker Park neighborhood. Despite being new, the dwelling hadn't sold</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I found they hadn't flushed the toilets in eight months," Ryan says. "So they had rings on them. It looked like a foreclosed property.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He had the home painted and professionally cleaned. And with the addition of a few flowers on the porch, the listing went into contract in four days for $1.72 million, or 97% of the asking price in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If you were trying to sell your car," Ryan says, "you would go get it detailed.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, the supply shortage in the luxury market is less severe than in other price tiers, partly because more high-end homeowners are putting their properties up for sale. New listings of luxury homes grew 15.8% year over year in the first quarter, while listings in most other price tiers declined, according to Redfin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only by building more homes in other price tiers can inventory levels build up sufficiently to help first-time buyers, who are still struggling to find homes in the current market, says Yun, the economist with NAR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given that supply is meeting demand in the luxury market, home sellers could view sprucing up their homes as a way to stand out from the crowd.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Li says that while he’s glad he spent the extra money on fixing up the house, it was a dilemma, nevertheless.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think I sold it too soon," he says with a laugh.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After five years of carefully saving money for a down payment on their first home, Christine Rodriguez and her husband, Oscar, hoped to finally move out of their rented trailer in Des Moines, Iowa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pandemic made their need more urgent. While five of their six kids were studying online from home, the three-room dwelling started to feel untenable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The children, ages 6 through 17, couldn’t even freely play outside.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When you live in a trailer, your neighbors are so close," says Christine, a waitress at a sports bar. "We have a yard, but it's not too much. We just wanted them to be able to go out and just be kids, like, you know, screaming and yelling and just having fun playing and not bothering other people because we're so close.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After contacting a real estate agent to look for starter homes in the $150,000 to $220,000 range, Rodriguez found about 25 listings that interested her. Ten were gone before she could make an appointment to view them, and the others were snapped up within hours of her visiting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Searching for a home? These are the top 20 US housing markets</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We don't even have time to process or think, and they're like, 'OK, it just sold,'" she says, adding, "It doesn't feel like there's anything out there or, if there is, I feel like some of them are priced way too high and the sellers aren't willing to come down at all.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rodriguez’s experience reflects a national trend. The number of homes sold nationally in the $100,000-$250,000 range fell by 11% in February from a year earlier, the National Association of Realtors told USA TODAY. In the less-than-$100,000 price range, the percentage of homes sold dropped by 26%. Homes sold for more than $1 million rose by 81%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the red-hot pandemic housing market, where prices have risen across the board, the ability to purchase homes seems proportional to the price range – the higher the price, the greater the sales. Growth has historically been similar across price tiers, but that has diverged during the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take Chappaqua, New York, which is 35 miles north of midtown Manhattan and a hamlet where Bill and Hillary Clinton live. Two years ago, homes priced at more than $2 million would sit on the market for a long time, says Usha Subramaniam, a real estate broker with Compass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2019, two homes sold for more than $2 million. Last year, in the middle of the pandemic, that number jumped to 17. This year, 17 homes in that price range had sold or were in contract by April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wealthier Americans are buying up pricey, larger properties in places such as Chappaqua because they want houses with offices, gyms and other amenities while they and their families work and entertain themselves from home during the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They want move-in-ready homes," Subramaniam says. “They want the big white kitchen. They want the big family room. They want a huge master bathroom. In other words, they want a classic grand house. If they're going to leave the city, then they want to have it all here.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A divergent housing market</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower-priced homes, where sales have decreased, tell another story about the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline in their sales is not due to a lack of demand, experts say, but rather a combination of low inventory and increasing prices caused by fierce competition. As a result, it's harder for many Americans to buy their first homes, and that missed opportunity can widen the wealth gap, economists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is clear that homeownership is one of the most successful and biggest sources of wealth creation, particularly at the lower end of the income spectrum," says Mark Fleming, chief economist for First American. "They don't own a home, and therefore they cannot generate the wealth."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices soar</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home prices rose in February at the fastest pace in nearly 15 years as strong demand for housing, low mortgage rates and a national housing shortage gathered momentum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The February S&amp;P <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> Case-Shiller U.S. national home price index, released Tuesday, rose 12% from a year earlier, the biggest gain since 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The housing boom will continue through 2021. … The run-up in house prices will erode affordability, particularly for first-time homebuyers," says Abbey Omodunbi, a senior economist for PNC Financial Services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Omodunbi notes that the passage of the First-Time Homebuyer Act, which would provide a tax credit for rookie buyers, should support demand from people looking for their first property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices of the country’s most affordable homes rose 16.5% year over year in the first quarter, and luxury prices saw a similar gain (14.7%), according to an analysis by the Redfin real estate brokerage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate, the most popular home loan product, sank to its lowest level on record, to 2.65%, according to mortgage finance company <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. Mortgage rates set record lows more than a dozen times last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although rates have ticked up, they remain near all-time lows, at 2.97% for the 30-year fixed mortgage. That’s down nearly 2 percentage points since November 2018, when rates stood at 4.94%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People are able to buy higher-priced homes because they have the purchasing power driven by low mortgage rates," Fleming says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These rates are typically for buyers who bring strong credit scores and large down payments to the table. First-time homebuyers face stricter lending requirements as lenders want to ensure that borrowers can still make their mortgage payments after a historic wave of layoffs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Stark, CEO of Americana Holdings, which owns Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Nevada Properties, Arizona Properties and California Properties and has 3,500 agents in the three states, says he’s seen first-time buyers struggling to make successful offers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I have seen traditional buyers who are well-qualified being squeezed out. … They don't have such additional cash to put down,” he says. “They also lose out when they're going against a cash offer, which is simpler for the seller.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing shortage</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another reason for the low supply of affordable homes is the cumulative effect of builders not putting up enough homes since the last housing crisis – when many went bankrupt, says Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing market shortage increased to 3.8 million units by the end of 2020, according to data from <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Builders have focused on luxury homes because of higher margins," Yun says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A number of factors have contributed to the lack of available housing, says Robert Dietz, chief economist for the National Home Builders Association. The cost of building a single-family home in the affordable price range, for instance, is more challenging because of regulatory requirements, such as town permits, higher lumber costs and exclusionary zoning laws that prohibit homes to be built on small lots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You can see quickly how difficult it is to build, say a $250,000 house in California,” Dietz says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lumber prices have soared nearly 200% since mid-April 2020, increasing the average price of a new home by $24,000, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Lumber price spikes are not only sidelining buyers during a period of high demand, they are forcing builders to put projects on hold at a time when home inventories are already at a record low,” he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply shortage in the luxury market is less severe than in other price tiers partly because more high-end homeowners are putting their properties up for sale. New listings of luxury homes grew 15.8% year over year in the first quarter, while new listings in most other price tiers declined, according to the Redfin report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time buyers face uphill challenge</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tiffany Ehler, a real estate agent in Des Moines, Iowa, where the average median home price is $235,000, says she’s never experienced such an overheated market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The Midwest market typically is very steady. This is the first spring that I honestly feel like there's just so much demand, it's leaving us scrambling," she says. "Anything $250,000 and below is literally selling in seconds.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sellers are looking at some new strategies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When a listing comes on the market, the listing agent will put right in the comments that no offers will be accepted for the next three days,” Ehler says. “And that actually will allow the buyers a chance to get into the property. They will look at all offers on the day they pick and will want the highest and the best offers, so there's no negotiating at the same time.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amid the bidding wars and high prices, the appraisals often do not come in at the offered purchase price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“All of a sudden, people are scrambling because now buyers can't get the property at that price because the lenders will not lend on that amount of money,” Ehler says. “So that's not good for sellers, and that’s not good for buyers.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ehler says she is concerned about buyers waiving inspections to stay competitive with their offers. “You're talking about a potential first-time homebuyer, then you get into the property and you may have some surprises that you weren't prepared for,” she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ehler started working with Christine Rodriguez, the mother of six who lives in a trailer, after Rodriguez didn't to have any success with her first agent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rodriguez says the process has been frustrating. Each time she goes to view a house, her children get excited, but she eventually has to give them the bad news.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They have waited for a long time. I am just looking for a three-bedroom house, a big enough kitchen to put a dining table so we can all sit and eat together,” she says. “I just want my kids to have a bigger yard and just be able to move around freely.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vaccinations, checks boost gDP's growth in q1</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economic growth accelerated in early 2021 as federal stimulus checks and fast-growing COVID-19 vaccinations left consumers flush with cash and ready to spend it just as more states lifted business constraints. The nation's gross domestic product, the value of all goods and services produced in the U.S., increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.4% in the January-March period, the Commerce Department said Thursday. The surge in consumer spending was bolstered by another strong quarter of business investment as companies rushed to meet the customer demand with purchases of new equipment and factory machines, and housing starts continued to soar.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As wealthy Americans took advantage of cheap mortgages, increased savings and the ability to work from home during the pandemic, their demand for bigger homes and million-dollar listings outpaced sales of homes across all other price ranges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes sold for more than $1 million rose by 81% to 17,216 in February, from 9,635 a year earlier. At the same time, the number of homes sold for less than $100,000 fell 26% to 22,569 from 30,382 a year earlier, the National Association of Realtors told <span class="companylink">USA TODAY</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Midwest, the volume of homes sold for above $1 million doubled in the same period. In the Northeast, the number increased by 98%. In the South, it was up by 94%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, a lack of inventory of homes below $250,000 and job losses have caused a fall in sales of homes in that bracket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More rooms; pricier homes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Americans of means, the demand for larger homes was driven by a desire for more rooms that could be used as offices and gyms while they worked from home during the COVID-19 crisis, says Lawrence Yun, chief economist for NAR, who adds, "The larger space automatically means that it is more expensive."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Falling mortgage rates (currently 3.04%) throughout 2020 and early this year also have also boosted sales of luxury homes, Yun says. Luxury homes are those in the top 5% of any market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While growth in homes sales has been similar across price ranges in the past, it has diverged during the pandemic as economic inequality rises, the Seattle-based real estate brokerage Redfin found in a report given exclusively to <span class="companylink">USA TODAY</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of luxury homes in the U.S. rose nearly 42% year over year in the first three months of 2021, far outpacing sales growth in every other price tier, according to Redfin. By comparison, sales of affordable homes (those in 5th-35th percentile) increased 7%, while sales of mid-priced homes climbed just 5.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are people who have become much wealthier as their stock portfolios rise and they aren't spending money on other things besides housing," says Redfin Chief Economist Daryl Fairweather. "They are not going out to restaurants or on vacations, and they want to spend their money on housing, spending more time at home."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The typical luxury home for sale during the first three months of the year spent 61 days on the market – 38 fewer than the same period in 2020. That compares with 26 fewer days for expensive homes, 18 fewer days for mid-priced homes and 14 fewer days for affordable homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the reasons the inventory of affordable homes is low is because those owners aren't listing them, Fairweather says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners in that bracket are hesitant to put their properties on the market because they're worried they'll struggle to find their next house, Fairweather says. Another reason is mortgage forbearance during the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're struggling financially, the forbearance relieves you of making mortgage payments, and having to sell, she says. "So that's holding back inventory."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another reason for the low supply of affordable homes is the cumulative effect of builders not putting up enough homes ever since the last housing crisis when many went bankrupt, says Yun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Instead, builders have focused on luxury homes because of higher margins," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing market shortage increased to 3.8 million units by the end of 2020, according to new data from mortgage giant <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices rising</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices are rising in every segment of the market as low mortgage rates, the national housing shortage and a pandemic buying spree fuel competition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices of the country's most affordable homes rose 16.5% year over year in the first quarter, with luxury prices seeing a similar gain at 14.7%. The remaining three tiers saw increases of closer to 10%, according to the report.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a record-breaking 5.6 million homes sold in 2020, the highest in 14 years, the U.S. housing market is heating up even more as it enters the traditional homebuying season in April. The time frame between March and August accounts for 56% of existing home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reclaiming the top spot as the hottest market in the country is the Manchester-Nashua metro area in New Hampshire after last holding the title in October 2020. Half of all homes in Manchester, which is about 46 miles from Boston, were selling in under 19 days in March — 10 days faster than last year, and 35 days faster than is typical in the rest of the country, according to a report by Realtor.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“For buyers, it's a tough real estate market,” said Hale. “But we should see more sellers coming, which means more options for buyers who may be quite frustrated at not finding what they're hoping to find when they are there.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ten states were represented in the top 20 list -- California, Idaho, Indiana, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Washington and Wisconsin. California dominated with six markets represented.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the midst of a raging COVID-19 pandemic, with millions of Americans still out of work and facing the possibility of eviction and foreclosure, the United States is experiencing a real estate boom the likes of which it hasn't seen in 15 years. Home prices are rising practically everywhere. From Augusta, Maine, to Phoenix and from Sarasota, Florida, to Aberdeen, Washington, prices are up by double digits. Driven by historically low interest rates that make borrowing cheap and waves of people fleeing densely populated cities because of COVID-19, home buying has become as competitive as it was during the boom years of the mid-2000s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes for sale have dwindled</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supplies of existing dwellings have dwindled far below the six-month level considered normal. Realtors are receiving multiple offers. Builders can't keep up with demand and flipping is back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Talk of a housing bubble is now common among analysts – including those at Swiss banking giant <span class="companylink">UBS</span>, who back up their claims with charts showing how home prices are outstripping both wages and rents. While home prices have appreciated more than 60% since November 2012, incomes have only appreciated by 20% and rents by 30% over the same time period. The upshot: Homes are out of reach for more and more buyers every year, the analysts argue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But unlike the real estate boom that led to the Great Recession, this nationwide price spike is not being fueled by a wholesale collapse in lender ethics. There aren't any low-doc or no-doc loans to be had and borrowers are having to do much more than fog a mirror to get funding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supply and demand fundamentals also can fuel rising prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For over a decade, we've had a chronic lack of supply of housing," said Marco Santarelli, chief executive of Norada Real Estate Investments in Laguna Niguel, California. "We need 1.62 million units a year to keep pace with organic demand, but we produce significantly less. We're about 370,000 units short each year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Santarelli added that the supply imbalance will only get worse as more than 140 million millennials and members of Gen Z move into rental units and starter homes in the years ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"About 52% of young adults from 18 to 29 are still living with their parents," Santarelli said. "That's the highest rate in over 110 years. These people have to go somewhere and that's why I'm so bullish about real estate over the long term.".</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An out-of-balance housing market</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But these healthy fundamentals don't mean there aren't worrying distortions in the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> continuing to buy Treasury bonds and other securities under its quantitative easing program, interest rates are being held artificially low as dollars are being pumped into the economy. That makes borrowing cheap and encourages investors to buy riskier assets such as stocks and real estate, driving prices of those assets ever higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> halts its bond buying and interest rates begin to rise again, real estate prices will continue to climb, says Robert Goldman, a real estate agent with <span class="companylink">Michael Saunders &amp; Co</span>. in Sarasota. And no change in policy is expected any time soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Fed will keep buying bonds far into the future despite what could be a booming economy in 2021 and 2022," Goldman said in his monthly newsletter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We had a 10.2% increase in home prices in Sarasota in 2020," Goldman told <span class="companylink">USA TODAY</span>. "What I'm concerned about is that prices will continue to appreciate at 10% to 15% a year and that's not sustainable."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a certain point, interest rates will rise and there won't be enough buyers coming in from more expensive markets to keep paying the higher prices. Either development or both, could lead to a pullback in prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The moratoriums on evictions and foreclosures also are distorting the market. There's no question these policies are needed to keep people from being displaced in the midst of a pandemic, but they will eventually have to be lifted and it is not clear what will happen when they do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Santarelli is confident the damage will be minimal. He believes renters will find jobs when the economy rebounds and they will not join the legions of the homeless. He also believes homeowners will either be able to sell their houses and condos and walk away with equity, or refinance or modify and tack whatever they owe to the back end of their mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We saw people's equity grow 11% last year and it's expected to grow another 6% this year," Santarelli said. "So the appreciation is in their favor. They can sell or refinance and banks are well off either way."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If homeowners can't sell or refinance, there could be a spike in foreclosures and the supply of homes on the market would increase sharply, pushing down prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rental market is humming</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the segment of the real estate market that seems to be working most efficiently at the moment is the rental market. As people leave densely populated cities to escape COVID-19 and congestion, rents are dropping. In San Francisco, rents fell 24% in 2020, according to Zumper.com, which tracks rents across the country. They were down nearly 20% in New York and 17% in Boston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In cities such as Newark, New Jersey, Sacramento, California, and Richmond, Virginia, where people are relocating, rents are moving sharply in the opposite direction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The top eight cities in the nation, which were very hot and very millennial heavy, have seen enormous declines in rent, while secondary cities in the same regions have benefited," said Anthemos Georgiades, co-founder and chief executive of Zumper.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median home prices in cities experiencing major out-migration, however, have not fallen – at least not yet. New York, for instance, saw rents drop by 20%, but its median home prices rose 6%. The same trend holds true in San Francisco, Boston, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Georgiades says that's because the rental market is much more dynamic than the "for sale" market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Rent prices adjust super quickly to the realities of the market," Georgiades said. "If I get a vacancy in April, the clock is ticking. I've got a depreciating asset. I'm going to drop my price fast to get someone in there."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners looking to sell their properties are willing to be more patient, he said. So prices don't adjust as quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Norada Real Estate Investments, San Francisco's infamously hot real estate market has cooled of late. But inventories of unsold homes are still tight and that's why prices aren't declining. The reality in New York is different. Norada is reporting that there are now more homes on the market in the city than there are buyers who want them, which puts buyers in the driver's seat when it comes to downward price negotiations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's cities such as these that should see prices decline first, according to prominent Yale economist Robert Shiller, and he advised homebuyers in a <span class="companylink">New York Times</span> column "to avoid investing in too expensive of a house or in taking on too much risk."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices gone wild</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Mark Stapp, a real estate professor at Arizona State University, what's going on in the real estate market right now is not a bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The definition of a bubble is that when it pops, there's nothing there," Stapp said. "That's not this case. There's very real demand that exists and that's what's causing prices to increase."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Realtors across the country generally agree.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mary Jo Santistevan, a top producing sales associate with <span class="companylink">Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices</span> in Phoenix, said buyers are flowing in from congested cities of California, Washington state and the Midwest. They are looking to take advantage of Arizona's lower home prices, lower property taxes and quality of life. But they are confronting a situation where inventories of unsold homes have been dropping steadily in recent years and are now teetering on a one-month supply in some areas and less than that in others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Even builders are struggling to keep up with demand," Santistevan said. "There's a 10-month wait time for construction. The majority of builders are using a lottery system. One builder in particular in Gilbert had a wait list of 100 deep."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stacie Lee, a fellow agent at Berkshire Hathaway, says whenever something goes on the market in Phoenix, the showings are usually back-to-back and closing comes within a matter of days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Many homes go for $30,000 to $40,000 over list price and a few homes in the mid $300,000s have sold for $100,000 over list," Lee said. "A lot are going for cash. Cash is king right now."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lee added that she had 70 people show up for an open house over the summer and had 15 offers in the first couple of hours. The home sold for $375,000 and is now back on the market at $550,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's a lot of investors flipping homes here," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly 3,000 miles away in Augusta, Maine, the housing market is just as frothy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fifteen of Maine's 16 counties experienced a 10% increase in median home prices in 2020, according to Aaron Bolster, president of the Maine Association of Realtors. Some of those counties saw leaps of 20% or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We already knew Maine was popular," Bolster said. "More than 32 million people visit between Memorial Day and Labor Day. They don't typically come at this time of year. But in a pandemic, it's a safe place to be. The population density is very low and teleworking suddenly got popular in 2020."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bolster said 25% of buyers in 2019 came from out of state. Last year, that number rose to 33%. Without a large housing stock to begin with, available listings got siphoned off pretty quickly as out of state buyers bid up the prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the moment, there are only 6,000 homes for sale in the entire state, Bolster said, and half of them are under contract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The situation is unique for Maine and Bolster is not sure how long it will last, especially given that the demand is driven by people coming from out of state – many of whom will presumably be able to work from home – and not by job creation within Maine's borders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Maine doesn't create a lot of new jobs," Bolster said. "When we create a new job, we give one up. So real estate doesn't usually appreciate that fast. It's interesting to see such a robust market when it's not really tied to economics."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Maine doesn’t create a lot of new jobs,” Bolster said. “When we create a new job, we give one up. So real estate doesn't usually appreciate that fast. It’s interesting to see such a robust market when it’s not really tied to economics.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market is booming and much of the surge is due to first-time homebuyers. But amid a raging pandemic and soaring home prices, their parents also deserve a heap of credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than half of Americans who bought their first home in 2020 said family or friends helped them with the down payment, according to a survey of 1,000 recent and prospective buyers conducted January 7-11 by HarrisX for realtor.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July, just 26% of first-time home buyers who purchased during the prior 12 months said they got assistance from family or friends, according to a separate survey by the National <span class="companylink">Association of Realtors (NAR)</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Different surveys can have varying methodologies. And the NAR poll asked buyers if they received a gift or loan while the realtor.com survey only specified a loan. But realtor.com chief economist Danielle Hale said she believes most respondents didn’t distinguish between a loan or gift.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing bubble?A rapid rise in home prices has some experts worried</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'This is life-changing': Meet the Redditors behind the <span class="companylink">GameStop</span> saga</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers ask for help during COVID</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rather, she said, high-flying home prices, low interest rates and the financial strains inflicted by the COVID-19 crisis have led more buyers to seek help from relatives or friends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The pandemic has shifted things in a big way,” Hale says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nick Libert, owner of Exit Strategy Realty in Chicago, says first-time buyers are racing to take advantage of mortgage rates that have been pushed to historically low levels during the health and economic crisis. Since they’re buying before saving up all the cash they need for a down payment, many are turning to family or friends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bryce Corey, 24, a software developer, and his girlfriend hunted for a Denver-area starter home costing under $350,000 for several months beginning last summer. But they were outbid eight or nine times, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It was definitely disheartening,” he says. “It kind of knocked us back a little bit each time.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, Corey’s parents agreed to provide a roughly $10,000 loan to enhance his 5% down payment and boost his chances of winning a bidding war.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It made us all feel better (that it was a loan rather than a gift),” Corey says. “I wouldn’t want to just take their money and run with it.” Ultimately, he couldn’t find a suitable house and decided to move back in with his parents in Lansing, Michigan, to sock away more money before resuming his search in May, but their offer is still good, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices rise</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of an existing U.S. home reached $309,800 in December, up 12.9% from a year earlier, according to NAR, as low housing supplies drove up prices. Nationally, there was a 1.9 month supply of homes on the market in December -- the time it would take to run out of homes for sale if no new units were added. That’s an all-time low and down from a three-month supply a year earlier,</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MyPillow fight: Company <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> account permanently suspended following Trump ally CEO Mike Lindell's ban from platform</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the COVID-19 crisis prompted the Federal Reserve to slash interest rates early last year, pushing down mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average 30-year fixed mortgage rates stood at 2.7% last week, nearly a percentage point lower than a year earlier, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. If buyers can get aid with their down payment from family or friends to defray higher prices, the low rates can allow them to cut their monthly mortgage costs, Hale says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Millions of millennials who have been putting off marriage and living with their parents are finally ready to settle down and buy homes, Hale says. Nearly 5 million millennials turned 30 last year, according to the Census Bureau and realtor.com. Thirty-one percent of home purchases in December were by first-time buyers, NAR figures show. At the same time, the pandemic has spurred many Americans who are working remotely to flee cities for bigger houses in more sparsely populated suburban and rural areas, fueling housing sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“People feel now is the right time,” she says. “They’re trying to make it happen sooner rather than later.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eighteen percent of the first-time buyers surveyed by realtor.com said they got help from their parents, while 12% cited siblings; 14%, extended family; and 8%, friends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Can't afford a down payment</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All told, 44% of first-time buyers didn’t have enough for a down payment last year, the survey shows. Half of first-time buyers squirreled away enough in less than three years by setting aside a portion of their paycheck each month, cutting out discretionary spending and saving lump-sum money like tax refunds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other survey findings:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers had to compromise in 2020, with 21% expanding their searches to less expensive neighborhoods, 20% raising their budgets and 18% cutting out features they desired, like a garage, pool or finished basement.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Competition among homebuyers has remained fierce during the COVID-19 pandemic due to record-low mortgage rates, a shortage of homes for sale and a sudden wave of relocation from remote work, triggering a surge in home prices that is showing no signs of slowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median home sale price rose 15% from a year ago to $322,000 for the week that ended Nov. 1 – the highest on record, according to Redfin, a real estate brokerage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market is so hot that offering all cash for a home doesn't always cut it anymore, experts say. But there are things that potential homebuyers can do to entice sellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What wins a bidding war today is offering more than the asking price and waiving the appraisal contingency," according to Redfin real estate agent Anthony Gonzalez.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Generally, if you're bidding on a house that's in great condition in a good location with multiple offers, you've gotta go at least $20,000 over ask.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Every single time that my client does, they win the deal."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, competition in the housing market has cooled since the summer. The typical home gets four or five offers, compared with eight or nine in September, according to Redfin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, home prices continue to buck their typical seasonal pattern since there are more buyers than normal at this time of year, experts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And lower mortgage rates could push even more buyers to purchase a home in the final months of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national median home price typically peaks the first week of July and declines through the fall. This year, however, home prices have climbed 7.3% since the four-week period ending July 5.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're looking to buy or sell a home, here are some other tips:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyer tips</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't give up. Be patient. Homebuyers may have to bid on several properties before they beat out the competition for that dream home, experts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Work with a broker. A local Realtor will know how to sweeten the pot for that potential seller, and make your offer the most attractive, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Go the extra mile. Consider writing the seller a letter. Other financial incentives such as having an all-cash offer, shortening the escrow terms, waiving contingencies and offering more money will likely help potential buyers, Realtors advise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Advice for sellers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spruce it up . "Even in this tight inventory environment, homebuyers' expectations have risen," says Jessica Lautz, vice president of demographics and behavioral insights at NAR. "When they come into homes, they expect them to look like TV shows. They expect them to be staged. They're attracted to beautiful photos online. Those types of factors really do matter.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't get greedy. "An overpriced home is still going to sit on the market," says Jason Gell, president of the Greater Boston Association of Realtors. "With the right price, you're likely to get a bidding war."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Know where you're moving before you hand over the keys. Have a plan for what you will do after you sell your home.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as the housing market booms, the outlook for the construction of shops, office buildings, hotels and other commercial structures has grown bleaker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that could mean less economic activity and job growth as the nation digs out of the COVID-19-induced downturn. Nonresidential construction spending is on pace to total $800 billion this year, according to the Census Bureau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seventy-five percent of commercial contractors say their projects have been postponed or canceled during the pandemic, according to a survey of more than 1,000 firms this month by Associated General Contractors, the industry's leading trade group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's up from 60% in August and 32% in June, says the group, which planned to release the figures Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The numbers "sound alarming," AGC chief economist Ken Simonson says. "It looks as if the amount of commercial construction is headed downward for some time to come."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private nonresidential construction spending was flat from January through August, according to Census Bureau data out this month. Outlays fell 16.6% for amusement and recreation, 9.7% for lodging, 4.5% for offices and about 4% for retail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The AGC survey focuses on planned projects, underscoring that the downturn in commercial and public building is likely to persist. Forty-one percent of the contractors surveyed said at least one project scheduled for this month or later had been scrapped or delayed, and 8% said jobs slated to begin next July or later have been affected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the construction of single-family homes was up 3.1% through August, and housing starts last month reached the highest level since June 2007, Census figures show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The AGC survey reflects U.S. economic activity that has shifted from offices, malls and hotels to homes during the health crisis, and some of the changes could be long-lasting. Many companies plan to allow a significant portion of their employees to work remotely at least some of the time even after the pandemic is over. The outbreak has accelerated a long-standing transition by shoppers from brick-and-mortar stores to e-commerce. And with many Americans minimizing travel, hotel occupancy could be in the doldrums for some time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A third of the construction companies surveyed by AGC don't expect their volume of business to return to pre-pandemic levels for at least six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Are people ever going to come back to the office?" Simonson asks. "We're not going to see the same development for hotels and stores for many years, if ever."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, public construction, such as highways and airports, is likely to be constrained by big declines in state and local revenue during the pandemic, Simonson says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forty-six percent of contractors surveyed want Congress to make bigger infrastructure investments. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden is proposing $2 trillion in climate and infrastructure spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some sectors are doing well. Warehouse construction spending is up 16.5% this year, according to the Census data, as consumers buy more items online that are shipped to their homes from distribution centers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dan Puente, president of DP Electric, a subcontractor in Fountain Hills, Arizona, says developers this year shelved all six planned projects in his backlog, including several office buildings and a hotel, totaling $10 million in revenue. Plans for one or two health care complexes were eventually revived.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I was thinking, 'Oh, my God. This is crazy,'" he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Puente says his 350-employee firm survived by soliciting business from contractors in industries that were doing well, such as manufacturing, health care and data centers. As a result, his firm's revenue and employment are up moderately this year, but area construction companies that can't shift to other sectors have not fared as well, says Puente, who also is chairman of the Arizona Builders Alliance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, nonresidential construction employment fell 7.1% from February to September, according to the Labor Department and AGC. And 30% of contractors surveyed by AGC furloughed or laid off workers from March 1 to Oct. 1 as a result of the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many projects that have moved forward have been sidetracked because of the crisis, with 78% of contractors surveyed experiencing delays or disruptions. Forty-two percent cited shortages of construction materials, equipment or parts; 35%, shortages of craft workers or subcontractors; and 31%, fallout from a potentially infected person on a job site.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">new homes sales drop 3.5% after busy summer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes fell by 3.5% in September to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 959,000 million units, the Commerce Department said Monday, as the housing market's hot summer buying season cooled. The Commerce Department said Monday that despite the modest decrease, sales of new homes are up 32.1% from a year earlier. But the pandemic may start to weigh on the market as the colder winter months arrive and with coronavirus cases spiking across much of the U.S. The housing market, like most of the economy, came to a near standstill in March and in April, causing the typical spring summer buying season to be delayed until the summer. Once economies reopened, pent up demand translated into sales of both new and existing homes, driving home prices in many places to record highs.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> will deck its store aisles and website with holiday deals days after the election and ahead of Veterans Day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nation’s largest home improvement chain unveiled its Black Friday sales circular Monday on its mobile app in what is seen as a very different holiday shopping season amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of a short Black Friday sale that starts after Thanksgiving as in past years, <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>’s sale starts Nov. 6 and will continue through Dec. 2 with deals available while supplies last.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other major retailers including <span class="companylink">Walmart</span>, Sam's Club and Lowe's also have announced sales are starting earlier than in past years and lasting longer to spread out demand and reduce crowds. Target said last week that it is bolstering COVID-19 safety measures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home Depot Black Friday deals: <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> is kicking off Black Friday 2020 ahead of schedule—here's what to shop now</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Black Friday 2020: <span class="companylink">Walmart</span>, Lowe's have announced Black Friday plans. Here's how the holiday shopping season is different amid COVID-19</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atlanta-based Home Depot first announced in September it was reinventing its holiday sale known for drawing early Black Friday shoppers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Not wanting to drive that sort of traffic and crowds to our stores, we are extending the holiday period,” Ted Decker, the company's president and chief operating officer, said in an interview with USA TODAY. “We will still have values, but they will start in early November.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like other retailers who are pushing the hottest deals online of the season online, <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>'s longer sale will be different as shoppers and employees' safety is a top priority, officials said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</span> classified “shopping at crowded stores just before, on or after Thanksgiving” on a list of higher-risk activities to avoid and in guidance issued ahead of the fall holidays also suggest more online shopping.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’re not doing the big doorbusters but will be open on (Black) Friday and closed Thanksgiving like we always are," Decker said, adding the company's biggest gift-giving category is power tools.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Decker said stores will leverage space at the end of aisles for gifts and holiday products and throughout the stores to help promote social distancing. The company added curbside pickup as an option at the start of the pandemic and has seen explosive online sales growth, Decker said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The retailer's ad is 18 pages, and the savings run from Nov. 6 through Dec. 2 and are available while supplies last.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> says mobile app users will have access to view the deals in October before they go live. Once the deals are live shoppers can use the app’s “Product Locator feature to check inventory at your local store and find what you need fast this holiday season.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several items are listed in the ad as "online only" including home decor items, which include wine glasses, small appliances, rugs and furniture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There will be free delivery on more than 1 million items.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deals in the ad include free select power tools with purchase and up to 40% off select appliances. Among the top savings:</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has been booming during the COVID-19 crisis, but America's cities are taking it on the chin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while big cities such as New York and San Francisco, in particular, are struggling with falling prices, values in less densely populated cities such as Phoenix and Charlotte, North Carolina, are holding up fairly well, a new analysis shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study underscores that the spread of the virus and the trend toward remote work are driving the housing market, and may continue to restrain price growth in very crowded urban areas while boosting gains in more suburban areas for some time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the virus began to take a significant toll on public health and the economy in March, many Americans have been fleeing cities for suburban and rural areas both to minimize the risk of contagion and take advantage of remote work policies during the crisis, says economist Troy Ludtka of <span class="companylink">Natixis</span>, an investment banking firm. Those factors, he says, have bolstered home sales. Analysts believe the teleworking shift will at least partly continue even after the outbreak is over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, many Americans, who are still spending an inordinate share of their days at home despite gradual business reopenings, are hunting for houses with more indoor and outdoor space, according to Redfin, a national real estate brokerage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also underpinning strong sales are historically low mortgage rates, says Todd Teta, chief product officer for ATTOM Data Solutions, a real estate research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the four weeks ending Sept. 20, home sales were up 13.6% annually in U.S. suburbs, 13% in rural areas and 8.8% in urban areas, according to a Redfin study. Home prices rose 16.6% in rural areas, 13.7% in the suburbs and 13.1% in urban districts, Redfin figures show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many cases, the most densely populated cities have suffered sharper price declines or very modest increases because of higher contagion risk, according or a <span class="companylink">Natixis</span> analysis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's a bifurcation," Ludtka says. "People are less likely to purchase homes in areas where they may get sick."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among 20 cities in the S&amp;P <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> Case-Shiller's composite price index, 11 fell short of the 2.9% national price gain from March through July (the most recent data available) while nine topped that increase. New York and San Francisco, the two most crowded cities – at 28,000 and 19,000 residents per square mile, respectively – were most affected by depressed prices, the <span class="companylink">Natixis</span> analysis shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York, prices fell for three straight months and were down 0.3% in July from March levels, <span class="companylink">Natixis</span> figures show. In San Francisco, prices dipped in two of the most recent three months prices and were up less than 1% since March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among other underperformers, prices edged up 1.5% in Miami (ranked fourth in density), 2.4% in Chicago (ranked fifth), 2.6% in Los Angeles (ranked 10th), and 2.6% in Washington, D.C. (ranked seventh).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other measures show even sharper price declines in some areas. Median prices in Manhattan tumbled from $1.7 million in February to $1.2 million in June, according to ATTOM Data Solutions, a real estate research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, less tightly-packed cities fared better than average. From March to July, prices increased 4% in Phoenix (ranked 34th), 3.2% in San Diego (ranked 23rd), and 3.4% in Charlotte (ranked 37th), according to the <span class="companylink">Natixis</span> data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Some of the most popular places to buy a home are in the suburban outlying areas of major cities," says Daryl Fairweather, Redfin's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not every crowded city is seeing home prices suffer because of the pandemic and not all cities with more elbow room are prospering, the study shows, since other factors such as an area's economy may loom larger, Ludtka says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boston home prices, for example, were up 3.1% in the March-July period, though the city ranks third in population density. And prices have increased just 1.8% in Tampa even though the city is a relatively low 46th in density.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there's little doubt that the pandemic has upended the real estate market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York, condo and co-op sales had just started to recover in January after the 2017 tax code changes, which curtailed deductions for expensive homes, held down activity, says Martin Freiman, a Redfin broker. Since the crisis began, however, Redfin is handling about 600 sales a month in Manhattan, down from about 1,100 pre-pandemic, and prices have been reduced an average of about 10%, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Everybody just left the city en masse," he says. "People just stopped buying homes … You have an open house and no one shows up."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If companies such as <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and <span class="companylink">Google</span> return to their New York offices by next spring, Freiman foresees young professionals helping rejuvenate the market. But another fertile buyer segment – empty nesters – may be diminished with older Americans more vulnerable to COVID-19.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">existing home sales at highest level since 2006</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes rose 2.4% in August to its highest level since 2006 as the housing market recovers from a widespread shutdown in the spring brought on by the coronavirus outbreak. The National Association of Realtors said Tuesday that sales rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6 million homes sold last month. Sales are up 10.5% from a year ago and back to pre-COVID-19 levels of early 2020. Although the pace of sales has slowed significantly after back-to-back months of more than 20% gains, it's the third straight monthly gain after big, consecutive declines in March, April and May.</p>

The Commerce Department reported that the slight July gain followed a 0.5% decline in June. In July, spending on residential construction rose a solid 2.1% while nonresidential construction fell by 1% The 0.1% July gain was weaker than the 1% increase that many economists had been forecasting. Still, home sales have been strong after an initial hit from the pandemic, and the hope is that those gains will help lift housing construction.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite high unemployment and a pandemic continuing to spike in parts of the U.S., home sales are surging, leading to record-breaking prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median national price for a home in July was $304,100 in July, the first time ever that price tag topped $300,000, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And prices were up throughout the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Midwest, the median cost of a townhouse, home, or condo in July was $244,500, an 8% jump over that month last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Who's buying a new home?: Why are home sales breaking these records during the COVID-19 pandemic and recession?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jobless claims rise again: Layoffs: 1.2M workers file for unemployment amid COVID-19 spikes, pushing total in crisis above 55M</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the west, the median price was $453,800, an 11.3% spike over July 2019. And in the south, the median price was $268,500, 9.9% more than last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price bumps reflect the shrinking number of homes available for sale at a time when many Americans are eager to take advantage of low interest rates and buy. The 1.5 million houses, condos, and townhomes available for purchase in July was 21% lower than the housing inventory on the market one year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sellers are fielding multiple offers, and homes are staying on the market an average of just 22 days, the shortest span ever.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the midst of a pandemic and economic slowdown that has led to a 10.2% unemployment rate, many Americans don’t have the financial resources to buy a home, particularly lower-wage workers in the hard-hit hospitality and retail sectors.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales soared in July, continuing a stunning rebound buoyed in part by buyers seeking a more comfortable home in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales jumped 24.7% from the month before, according to the National Association of Realtors. That surge broke the record for a month-to-month sales spike set in June when completed home purchases rose 20.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">July sales rose 8.7% over the same month last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Right now housing, amazingly, in the midst of a global pandemic (and) high unemployment ... is in a booming phase,'' Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist, said in a briefing Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a significant segment of the country is being left out of the home buying rush because they can't afford to participate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Unfortunately, home prices have also soared in the last year, a consequence of high demand, relatively low supply and low interest rates,'' Robert Frick, corporate economist for the Navy Federal Credit Union, said in a statement. "This puts homeownership further out of reach for lower-income Americans and even middle-income Americans in some markets. That lower-income Americans have been hurt more by the pandemic just makes that situation worse."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes available to buy was down. The 1.5 million houses, condos, and townhomes available for purchase in July was 21% lower than the housing inventory on the market one year earlier. That helped elevate prices. The national median price for a home topped $300,000 for the first time, reaching $304,100 -- an 8.5% jump over July 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the higher price tags, many sellers are fielding multiple offers from buyers eager to take advantage of historically low interest rates that can shave hundreds of dollars off their mortgage payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers on average are signing a contract to purchase a home 22 days after the property went on the market, the fastest turnaround ever, Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some ways, the price spikes, bidding wars, and brisk sales reveal dueling sides of the coronavirus pandemic. While lower-wage earners, concentrated in hard-hit industries like retail and hospitality continue to struggle, higher-wage earners who are still employed are poised to take advantage of cheaper borrowing costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The job losses are principally coming in the area of leisure and hospitality or retail sectors,'' Yun said. "Those are lower-paying occupations so they are not really in the home buying market ... The upper-income bracket, they are more stable in terms of jobs, and they're trying to take advantage of these lower mortgage rates.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pandemic may have also impacted the market because more professionals were able to work from home, cutting out the need to live close to the office and ramping up the desire for a larger, more comfortable space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Even as people go back to work, maybe it’s no longer five days a week,'' Yun said. "Commuting becomes much less important, so people can buy out in the suburbs.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current economic downturn has been odd in so many ways. Why shouldn't it expose some economic myths and misconceptions as unreliable, if not outright untrue?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it comes to understanding the relationships involving home prices, bank deposits, interest rates and unemployment, many disconnects arise. Here are a few:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High unemployment and home prices</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You might think that as the nation's jobless rate has spiked during this social-distancing recession, that would put pressure on home prices, forcing some owners to miss payments and discouraging buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, that hasn't been apparent. Home prices were up 2.5% on average this year through April, according to S&amp;P <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> Case-Shiller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low interest rates, which make homes more affordable, are one factor supporting prices. Also, stimulus and other government payments have enabled millions of Americans to meet their obligations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flexible schedules: What are the pros and cons?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'I hide in the bathroom and cry': Americans struggle with unemployment delays</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plus, the economic slump has only lasted about four months so far, so the full impact might not have been felt yet. If the economy recovers strongly from here, negative housing fallout might not materialize in a big way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, it does seem like the other shoe could drop. <span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span>, the credit-rating agency, currently sees home prices nationally as 6.1% overvalued based on recent price increases, heightened unemployment and the possibility of lower incomes and rents. Values are most frothy in Nevada, Idaho, North Dakota, Texas and Arizona, Fitch said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The degree to which housing might become more overvalued depends on the future path of unemployment and personal incomes, said Suzanne Mistretta, Fitch senior director.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company sees the U.S. jobless rate easing to 7.8% next year from an average 10.3% in 2020. Though not approaching overvaluation levels of 20%-plus from 2005 to 2007, housing still could reach its highest level of overvaluation in more than a decade, Fitch warned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal deficits and interest rates</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many people used to assume widening federal deficits would exert a crowding-out effect, pushing interest rates higher as the supply of debt mushroomed and private savings were siphoned from other investments. Few people seem to be focused on this connection anymore given that interest rates keep dropping while Washington's borrowing needs continue unabated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One explanation for why the link doesn't seem to work is the lack of inflation, as inflation and long-term interest rates tend to move together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another is the preference among investors for owning government bonds, which carry high credit ratings, during periods of heightened uncertainty. When things get tough investors get nervous. They snap up government bonds with preservation of capital, not yield, as the primary goal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the Tax Foundation noted in a 2016 report, some economists had been suggesting that budget deficits reduce economic growth by boosting interest rates and diverting private saving toward the purchase of government debt. But in practice, "It has been hard to find an empirical link between deficits and increased interest rates or reduced investment," the group concluded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rates are even lower, and deficits higher, today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low yields and deposit accounts</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You would think that with bank deposit accounts, money-market mutual funds and other risk-averse instruments yielding next to nothing, investors would be ready to move their money elsewhere. But so far, millions of people are willing to accept virtually no yield so long as their assets remains safe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bank deposits spiked by $1.2 trillion in the first quarter, the most recent figure tracked by the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corp</span>. That was nearly four times the size of any other quarterly deposit gain over the past decade. Americans also have been flocking to money-market funds and other risk-averse instruments. Money-fund assets are up more than $1 trillion so far this year, reports Money Fund Intelligence newsletter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not like risky stock-market investments have been faring all that poorly. The broad market was up roughly 43% from its recent low in late March through July 9. But for a lot of people, safety reigns supreme — and they're willing to pay a price for it, in low returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">College graduates and layoffs</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the recession, the vast majority of people with bachelor's degrees who wanted jobs could get them. As recently as March, the national jobless rate for college graduates was 2.5%. That was well below comparable figures for less-educated Americans, such as the 4.4% rate for people with only a high school diploma.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">College graduates also typically earn more — $1,248 a week on average for holders of bachelor's degrees only, compared with $746 for those with a high school diploma only, according to a May update by the <span class="companylink">Bureau of Labor Statistics</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'I'm ready to start with a career': 2020 graduates face uncertain job market with hope</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, that picture has changed a bit amid this coronavirus-induced economic slump. The jobless rate for college grads more than tripled overnight to 8.4% in April and 7.4% in May before easing to 6.9% in June, according to the Department of Labor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's still well below comparable rates for less-educated groups, such as the 12.1% June jobless rate for high-school graduates. (The department also tracks workers based on whether they have some high school attainment and some college.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, it lays to rest, at least temporarily, the notion that college graduates are immune from layoffs or other career bumps, especially amid an economic backdrop as strange as this one has been.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Saving money during recessions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You might think now would be a tough time to save money. During recessions and other periods of high unemployment, more people are financially stressed, the reasoning goes. It would be the time for many individuals to lean on their savings to help make ends meet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That might be the case for a lot of people, but it certainly doesn't tell the whole story. The nation's savings rate often has climbed during recessions, and while real-time numbers aren't available yet, that could be the case again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of this might reflect a reluctance or lack of opportunity to spend money. Think how much you have saved in recent months by eating at home rather than at restaurants, not taking vacations and so on. Perhaps many people also are making a genuine effort to get their budgets under control by putting off various types of spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not just individuals, either. A March survey of corporate finance officers conducted by the <span class="companylink">Association for Financial Professionals</span> noted the largest increase in three years of businesses holding short-term investments at banks.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">USC President C.L. Max Nikias, who stepped down in the wake of a sex abuse scandal, walked away with a compensation package worth nearly $7.7 million, a USA TODAY review of just-released tax documents show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">University officials declined to talk to USA TODAY, but a statement from the USC Board of Trustees said the board voted to honor Nikias’ contract and agreed “to certain other provisions to accelerate his departure.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax filing revealed a $3 million, no-interest housing loan for Nikias, who lived in the on-campus president’s home through the end of 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nikias, who began his tenure in 2010, agreed to step down in May 2018 amid a sex scandal involving George Tyndall, a gynecologist at the university for three decades who was charged with sexually assaulting female students.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hundreds of students, professors and alumni demanded Nikias step down, alleging USC had long failed to respond to complaints of misconduct involving Tyndall, detailed by the Los Angeles Times in its Pulitzer-Prize winning investigation.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Worried that juries deciding criminal and civil cases are whiter and wealthier than the rest of the population, some lawmakers introduced a proposal to add all taxpayers to the eligible pool of who can be summoned.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The coronavirus pandemic has brought out the competitive side in Laura Galeazzo as she searches for her forever home in Rochester, New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Galeazzo, a 33-year-old running coach at McKirdy Trained, an online coaching service for runners, has viewed a dozen houses and put offers on three of them, only to come up short as other buyers outbid her and her husband.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She fell in love with one of the first houses they bid on at an open house. The colonial-style, four-bedroom house with 2.5 baths was recently updated with a new roof, furnace and AC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But an older couple in their 50s stood in front of the open house during the entire time so they could beat other families to the punch as soon as it ended.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They stared people down to mark their territory,” Galeazzo said, adding that the older couple ended up getting the home when they offered $22,000 over the $234,000 asking price. “They even kept their car parked in the driveway so no one else could get in.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A dream home, a vintage school bus and quirky roller skates: Here's what couples are buying with their pandemic wedding funds</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ouch!: COVID-19 is forcing some people to put retirement on hold</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, Galeazzo and her husband started driving by other homes in their price range to check out the neighborhoods. But then they noticed they had competition when they kept seeing the same people also drive by the homes they were viewing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“My racing mentality kicked in. We need to beat them to the next house,” Galeazzo said. “It’s almost like you’re sizing up the competition for a bidding war. What if that five minutes it took to call your realtor made the difference?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing affordability</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New homeowners face obstacles getting a mortgage without a bigger down payment and higher credit scores since lending standards have tightened in the aftermath of the pandemic. Lenders want to ensure that borrowers can still make their mortgage payments during the crisis following a historic wave of layoffs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although mortgage rates hover at historic lows, potential buyers are battling low housing inventory and higher prices, an issue that has plagued house-hunters in recent years and is showing no signs of letting up. Homebuyers must act quickly when debating a purchase, sometimes offering over asking price or getting into a bidding war with other potential buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low inventory was an issue before the pandemic. Homebuilders that were pummeled by the housing crisis still haven’t returned to a normal production levels to meet current demand. Now the supply shortage is weighing on the housing market even further with increased competition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing inventory has dropped 29% from a year earlier through the week ending June 20, according to Realtor.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 40% of homeowners who purchased their home during the pandemic reported entering into a bidding war on at least one home, according to recent data from Clever Real Estate, which surveyed 1,000 homeowners from May 31 through June 2 who purchased their home between January and May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Housing affordability is a little easier on paper with low mortgage rates, but the bigger challenge is trying to find a home,” says Javier Vivas, director of economic research for Realtor.com. “Housing demand has increased beyond expectations. When you combine that with historically low levels of inventory, it’s a perfect storm for increased competition and an affordability crisis.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Boston metro area had the highest rate of competition, with 64.1% of offers written by Redfin agents on behalf of their homebuyers facing bidding wars in May, up from 56% in April. It was followed by Dallas at 60.8% and Washington, D.C., at 57%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cash is king</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brett-Ashlee Ward, a first-time homebuyer, put in offers for nine homes over the past three weeks in Oklahoma City. The 23-year-old was beaten out by cash offers every time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s crazy! How do these people even have that much saved in cash?,” Ward says, a co-host of The Sam Mayes podcast, a sports radio program. “It’s not like I’m low balling," she said, adding that she offered above the listing prices and didn't ask the sellers to cover the closing costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ward was preapproved for a $150,000 home loan backed by the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span>, with a 3.5% down payment. She is finally under contract for her tenth offer and hopes to close the deal in early August, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, requirements eased for higher down payments and credit scores than in previous years. Nearly 40% of homebuyers put less than 20% down on their homes in 2018, up from 22% a decade before, data from Clever Real Estate showed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New homeowners, however, face a harder time getting a mortgage without a bigger down payment and higher credit scores. Those who purchased a home this year, for instance, were 32% less likely to put less than 20% down on their homes than those who purchased between 2015 and 2019, according to Clever Real Estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices aren't budging</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price growth began accelerating for affordable homes after the <span class="companylink">World Health Organization</span> declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11,according to Redfin, a real estate brokerage. Home prices in many affordable areas have moved higher as buyer demand increased while the supply of homes for sale dropped. Prices will likely continue to grow faster for at least the next few years given this lack of supply, experts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices of the most affordable homes in the U.S. climbed 5.5% from a year earlier during the 12 weeks ending May 31, Redfin data shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Newark, New Jersey, the most affordable third of homes saw prices surge 14.7% from a year earlier to a median of $211,281 during the 12 weeks ending May 31, the largest increase out of the 50 most populous U.S. metropolitan areas. Philadelphia and Detroit followed, with prices jumping 13.6% and 13.3%, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sellers have the upper hand</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amanda Doucette, 27, learned the hard way that she and her husband had to make their offer as competitive as possible, or they’d be left in the dust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this month, they made a bid on a home built in 2015 in Grant Park, a newer subdivision in Columbus, Ohio, just a day after it was listed. But there were at least 15 other offers, and they found themselves on the losing end of a bidding war.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house was on the market for $420,000, and they offered to pay at least $10,000 more and take care of the costs of an appraisal gap if the home was appraised lower than the stated purchase price. Still, the seller chose another buyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"My husband and I are fortunate to both work in a field that pays well, we have good credit scores and saved money for a down payment," Doucette says, who works as a physician assistant at a local hospital in the city. "But we’re still having a hard time finding a home we can afford. Homeownership is difficult even if you do everything right.”</p>

The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor’s</span> 500 added 0.4% to close at 3,131.29, retracing losses after dropping 1% overnight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.7% to close at a fresh record of 10,131.37, its eighth consecutive day of gains, helped by strong gains from Apple after the company unveiled new features for its iPhones and Mac computers at its annual WorldWide Developers Conference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Technology sector stocks, which led the way higher as the market rebounded the past three months from a 34% plunge, helped power the latest gains. Health care stocks and companies that rely on consumer spending were among the big gainers. Real estate and utilities stocks fell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bond yields rose slightly, another sign that investors were regaining confidence in the economy.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coronavirus: 'Life-changing event' could alter how we work, spend and retire</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors appeared to look past reports of surging coronavirus cases in the U.S. and other countries to focus on evidence of economic recovery. On Tuesday, Federal health officials told Congress to brace for a second wave of coronavirus infections in the fall and winter of this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Volatility has picked up in recent weeks after stocks rebounded more than 40% from their March lows on hopes the worst of the pandemic was over. The near-term trajectory for the financial markets depend on several factors, analysts caution, including the spread of the virus, the development of treatments to lower mortality rates and ultimately the development of a successful vaccine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“While cases of new infections are rising in some countries and remain stubbornly high in others, there has not been a second wave of the coronavirus as yet in countries that quickly quarantined,” analysts at <span class="companylink">T. Rowe Price</span> said in a note. “However, it could take months to get meaningful portions of the public vaccinated.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors have been placing more weight on economic data releases that suggest economies that have reopened are making strides to emerge from a deep recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new single-family homes, a leading housing market indicator, rose more than expected in May, a sign the housing market is recovering in the wake of the pandemic. New home sales jumped 16.6% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 676,000 units, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Further updates on the U.S. economy are expected toward the end of this week, when the government will issue data on consumer spending, weekly unemployment aid applications and durable goods orders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks bounced back from overnight losses after Washington reassured investors that the trade accord with China was still intact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors were spooked by reported comments by White House trade adviser Peter Navarro suggesting the U.S. trade deal with China was in trouble. Navarro, however, said his comments were taken out of context, and President Donald Trump tweeted that the agreement with China, the basis for a truce in a tariff war over technology and other problems, is still on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comments by either side suggesting progress or problems with the trade agreement have added to the uncertainties prevailing in the midst of the pandemic, pushing and pulling at share prices. The Federal Reserve and other global central banks have intervened to calm markets in recent months in an effort to restore confidence among investors after the pandemic battered the global economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It appears this administration is ever so confused as the president says one thing and his trade advisor says another,” Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities, said in a note. “We believe these types of uncertainties could lead to another round of unsettled markets in spite of the Fed's printing presses working at full speed.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After some early losses, global markets pressed higher in Asia and Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 0.72% from 0.70% late Monday. It tends to move with investors’ expectations for the economy and inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Benchmark U.S. crude oil fell 9 cents to settle at $40.37 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, dropped 45 cents to close at 0.5% to $42.63 per barrel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Europe, France’s CAC 40 gained 1.4%, while Germany’s DAX rallied 2.1%. Britain’s FTSE 100 gained 1.2%. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 added 0.5%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index jumped 1.6% and South Korea’s Kospi climbed 0.2%. The Shanghai Composite gained 0.2%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales plummet 9.7% in may</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales in the U.S. plunged 9.7% in May. It was the third straight monthly decline and further evidence of the harm the virus pandemic has done to the housing market. The National Association of Realtors said Monday that the monthly decline pushed sales down to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.91 million, the slowest pace since a home buyers tax credit expired in October 2010. Sales fell in all regions of the country, with the biggest decline coming in the Northeast.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">factories orders for may are still in retreat</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American factories slowed for the third consecutive month in May as they continued to sustain economic damage from the coronavirus pandemic. The <span class="companylink">Institute for Supply Management</span> said Monday that its manufacturing index came in at 43.1 last month after registering 41.5 in April. Anything below 50 signals that U.S. manufacturers are in retreat. New orders, production, hiring and new export orders all fell in May but at a slower pace than they did in April.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. construction spending fell 2.9% in April, the largest drop in 18 months, with broad declines across all building activity as shutdowns hobbled projects and workers were told to stay home. The Commerce Department said that the April decline was the biggest monthly drop since a 3.% fall in October 2018. It followed a basically flat reading in March. Spending on residential construction dropped 4.5% in April with single-family construction down 6.6% and the smaller apartment segment down 9.1%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jessica Chamorro’s dream of owning her first home was upended in March after she was furloughed from her catering job at a hotel chain in Tampa, Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She and her husband, who have three children, had just started their pre-approval process to purchase a home this summer when the pandemic hit. Now their plans have been put on hold after the hotel industry was battered by travel restrictions and lockdowns. They are currently stuck in a 1,000-square-foot rental that they had been staying in temporarily to stash money away for a down payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I feel like the rug has been pulled out from under us,” Chamorro, 38, says. “Our goal was to get out. Now we’re stuck in this tiny house. It worries me because we were already living on top of each other to save money. I don’t know if I’ll even have a job to go back to.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like Chamorro, millennials and other younger Americans starting families and hitting their professional stride were poised this spring to achieve another milestone — buying their first home. Then the coronavirus hit, shuttering open houses, delaying deals, and causing would-be buyers to push pause as they worried about their health and the fate of their jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, applications to buy a home are again on the rise as states lift orders to stay inside. But the pandemic has altered how residential property is bought and sold, changes that aren't likely to disappear any time soon and that could reshape the American dream long after the current crisis has passed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A growing number of Americans are considering fleeing cities for the suburbs, to put more distance between themselves and their neighbors. Video home tours, a trend that was already increasing, may become routine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And rather than gathering in a courthouse or office conference room, more and more buyers and sellers are signing documents remotely instead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"All the technologies we've built for visualizing a home and virtualizing the closing process will just keep growing in importance," says Glenn Kelman, CEO of the national brokerage Redfin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Online searches for housing in small towns are growing at nearly twice the rate as queries for major metropolitan areas, he says. "Prior to this pandemic, the housing affordability crisis was already driving people from large cities to small,'' Kelman says. "Now more permissive policies around remote work, and a rising wariness about close quarters will likely accelerate that trend."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new reality will greet many of the buyers and sellers easing back into a thawing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage applications dropped 25% in April as compared to the month before, and were 12% below their total during the same month last year, as stay-at home mandates reached their peak, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But millennials remain eager to buy a place of their own, experts say. And with interest rates hovering at 3.41%, a near record low, a housing rebound could start as soon as this summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coronavirus takes steamout of home buying season but sales, prices should rebound</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You still have a lot of households at the point where they're interested in home buying,'' says Mike Fratantoni, chief economist for the MBA. "As some states have begun to reopen, we’ve seen a rapid pickup and ... very strong growth in purchase applications. And now we’re running only about 10% behind where we were last year.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Texas, North Carolina and Georgia, purchase applications have actually risen in comparison to 2019. And Fratantoni expects home sales for all of 2020 to be only 2% below where they were last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It all depends on how the pandemic evolves from here,'' he says, but currently, the future of home sales is "looking really, surprisingly strong.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors is slightly less optimistic about this year's forecast, predicting home sales will be 10% to 15% lower than 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But “sales will be higher by 15% to 20% in 2021 because more listings will steadily appear as the state economies steadily reopen,'' says Lawrence Yun, NAR’s chief economist,</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Head for the hills - or at least the suburbs</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A growing number of those sales might be in less crowded communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A survey by NAR found that 5% of members said the coronavirus pandemic was causing their clients to shift their sights away from cities to the suburbs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And 13% said the virus had made buyers prioritize a different home feature, such as a home office, or extra room where relatives could stay, as they considered what property to buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Remote work will become more prevalent,’’ Yun said of the home buying landscape in the wake of COVID-19. "That means there is less need to be close to the job centers. Suburbs and exurbs (areas situated beyond the suburbs and in, or adjacent to, rural areas) will get a greater interest. In addition, a larger single-family home with extra elbow room will be desired, such as dedicated office space and a personal gym.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data from the Harris Poll found that almost a third of Americans are thinking about moving to less densely populated areas. And 43% of city dwellers had recently checked a real estate site for a house or apartment to rent or buy as compared to 26% of those in the suburbs, and 21% of those in rural areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But being able to afford a home, whether in the suburbs or downtown, may be a tall task for some millennials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite an overall slip in home sales, the median home price has risen more than 5% as compared to last year, according to Yun, who noted that a shortage of available inventory has kept prices afloat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And stricter lending standards also threaten to block many first-time buyers. <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span>, for instance, now requires nearly all borrowers to put at least 20% down on a home, and it's raised the required minimum FICO credit score to 700 on purchase mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's a steep climb for many buyers who typically put down between 3% to 5% on their first home, says Odeta Kushi, deputy chief economist at First American Financial Corporation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">General worries about the stuttering economy also could dash the hopes of some potential buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Low mortgage rates will bump up demand and make housing more affordable,” says Kushi. “The bigger issue is economic uncertainty. Many people feel insecure about their job stability.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buying online, using a virtual notary</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who are able to buy a home may find that much, if not all, of the process has gone virtual.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers have been able to use FaceTime and other platforms to give video tours of houses for years. But those tools became critical during the pandemic when sellers became reluctant to have strangers traipsing through their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among sellers with active listings, the NAR survey found 68% wanted prospective buyers to use hand sanitizer, to use coverings for their shoes and face, or to wash their hands before entering their homes. When it came to home inspectors, 53% of sellers wanted them to take similar safety measures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokerages like Redfin, which has offices in more than 90 metro areas across the U.S. and Canada, canceled open houses as the coronavirus crisis escalated. And video walk-throughs became a common substitute for in-person visits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Van Fletcher, a broker/realtor with Allen Tate Realtors in Raleigh, North Carolina, was able to continue taking his clients, Liz Stokley and Ryan Stephens, on virtual tours, even as the couple stayed put in Baltimore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The married millennials, who intend to relocate to Raleigh, started their housing search in person in January. But they postponed a follow-up trip in March because they didn't want to fly in the midst of the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"So we started doing video tours with Van,'' Stokley said. "We felt very lucky that he was willing to go into these houses.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NAR's May survey found that among members who had a buyer put a contract on a home that week, 22% said the purchaser had only seen the property virtually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many buyers may continue conducting the bulk of their search via a computer screen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“For many home buyers today, the home search process starts online,'' says Fratantoni. "Greater use of online resources, less driving around, I think that’s definitely the trend we’re on.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But live walk-throughs are not likely to disappear, says Scott Elwell, Douglas Elliman Real Estate’s regional vice president of sales for Westchester County, New York, and New England.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Nothing will replace the experience of walking through a house and property,'' Elwell says. "I can see buyers looking at more houses online and weeding out what they don’t like, resulting in fewer in-person visits."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers and sellers may also increasingly complete their transactions online.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While 24 states have legislation that allow documents to be notarized remotely, 19 more passed executive orders to enable online signings after the pandemic hit, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Georgia is among the states to at least temporarily allow notaries to review paperwork with buyers and sellers on platforms like Zoom. Documents are mailed in afterward to get the official stamp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is an enhancement to the process that the industry has been working towards for several years,'' said Fratantoni. "It’s certainly needed in this kind of crisis but ... once people get used to the idea of not having to physically attend a closing, I think that might just become part of a new normal.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coronavirus has run roughshod over most of the nation's big-city real estate markets for more than six weeks now, paralyzing agents, halting showings and causing double-digit drops in listings and new inventory as frightened sellers withdraw their properties from consideration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in a precious few metro areas, something different is happening. In Atlanta and Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina, in Austin, Texas, among others, real estate agents are fighting back against the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They're making sure that state and local governments acknowledge that their profession is essential so they can keep working. They're figuring out how to make clients feel comfortable about interactions at a time of masks and gloves and disinfectants, and they're finding ways to complete just about every stage of the real estate transaction in the virtual world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You have to give a huge amount of kudos to the real estate community," said Jeremy Crawford, who runs Atlanta's Multiple Listing Service. "They learned how to show homes and sell homes and still practice social distancing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, this rare cluster of cities saw real estate listings or new inventory grow in the first week of April compared with the same period a year earlier, according to data provided by <span class="companylink">Zillow.com</span> – a remarkable achievement considering that almost every major metropolitan area in the country saw a sharp drop in those categories over the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider Los Angeles, which saw its total listings plunge 30% to around 12,800 as of April 5; or Phoenix, where listings were down 27% to just less than 15,000; or Philadelphia, where listings dove 26% to 14,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or ponder new inventory in Detroit, where only 113 new homes came on the market as of April 5 – 65% fewer than last year; or New York, where 532 new homes emerged – a 57% drop. These were massive declines, but not uncommon during COVID-19.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pattern: Cities that suffered the greatest declines in real estate activity were usually in regions where coronavirus landed first – the West Coast – or where the disease hit hardest and governments went into lockdown – the Northeast and upper Midwest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Pennsylvania and Michigan were two states that were very strict about lockdowns," said Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors. "Visiting a home was a violation there. As a result, Michigan and Pennsylvania real estate activity went down much more than say Virginia or Georgia."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jennifer Pino, the president of Atlanta Realtors Association, acknowledges that the continued strength of her city's real estate market is because the outbreak in Georgia came later and was not nearly as severe as in California or New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atlanta's real estate market also was in hyperdrive before COVID-19, Pino said. Inventory was extremely tight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But once the pandemic hit, Pino said Realtors in Atlanta petitioned Georgia's governor and the mayor of Atlanta to make sure everyone from agents to appraisers would be able to keep their doors open.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'We don't want people in our homes'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jo Gipson, an assistant broker with Compass Real Estate in Atlanta, said one of the biggest hurdles has been making sure buyers and sellers feel safe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In March there was a pause in the market," she said. "A bunch of sellers said: 'We don't want to have people in our homes.' Everything got put on hold or withdrawn. But that only lasted a couple of weeks until we were able to figure out what was safe."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Armed with gloves and masks and Purell, agents began to venture out again. They learned to go to homes ahead of time and turn on all the lights and open all the doors so buyers and their agents wouldn't have to touch anything. They learned not to ride around with clients in their cars. They relied more on virtual tours, walking through homes using FaceTime to show clients every nook and cranny.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We took it really seriously," Gipson said. "We knew people needed to feel comfortable." Then came the innovation, according to Tanya Ousler, and agent with Realty Associates of Atlanta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Realtors, mortgage brokers and bankers, title agents and attorneys figured out how to conduct practically every stage of the real estate transaction from showings to closings in the virtual world – the one exception being appraisals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most difficult piece, Ousler said, was the closing. But Georgia ended up allowing virtual notaries to oversee buyers, sellers and their attorneys remotely. The different parties all would appear on Zoom and go through the paperwork. Then the documents would be sent back to the attorney's office for their official stamps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Whether some or all of this will continue after this, I don't know," Ousler said. "But the crisis caused everyone to become more creative."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Following the rules</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Jason Lee and his wife, Katie, who were about to have their second child, the closing of their four-bedroom house coincided with the outbreak of COVID-19.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With help from Gipson, they found their new home in February in Decatur, a city northeast of Atlanta. They made an offer in mid-March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the time of the closing, the pandemic was in full swing. Jason Lee said there was nothing revolutionary about signing in all the right places.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We just followed the rules," Lee said. "We went to the closing in the attorney's office. Everyone sat in the conference room – eight feet apart. We all wore gloves and masks. We passed around the documents, and everyone used their own pens." He added that the room was sanitized before their arrival and again after they left.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result of these precautions and innovations, Ousler said Atlanta will not see much of a downturn when the April numbers come out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Crawford, the chief executive of First Multiple Listing Service in Atlanta, listings in his city have dropped 15% since the beginning of April. So home selection has dwindled. But Crawford said there's still plenty of data confirming the strength of Altanta's market in comparison to other cities across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> data, for example, shows that Atlanta was second in the country in terms of the decline in mortgage applications behind only Dallas. That means more buyers are moving ahead with purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That is a substantial change," Crawford said. "The Atlanta market is not only doing well compared to other regions of the country, it's doing a pretty darn good job compared to last year."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The same can be said of Raleigh-Durham, 400 miles to the north. The real estate market there was also red hot before COVID-19 and inventory was exceptionally tight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We had two months of inventory or less," said Van Fletcher, a broker/Realtor with Allen Tate Realtors in Raleigh.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When the initial shock of COVID-19 came, we hit a freeze frame on activity," Fletcher said. "Showings dropped off. New listings dropped off, and that lasted most of March. That's when we saw the greatest fear. But things started to thaw a little in April."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, the market has been relatively strong, especially at the low end. "Under $300,000, we're receiving multiple offers," said Otto Cedeno, the owner of Movil Realty, a Durham real estate firm. "People are buying properties without seeing them and closing on virtual tours."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coronavirus has run roughshod over most of the nation’s big-city real estate markets for more than six weeks now, paralyzing agents, halting showings and causing double-digit drops in listings and new inventory as frightened sellers withdraw their properties from consideration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in a precious few metro areas, something different is happening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Atlanta and Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina, in Austin, Texas, among others, real estate agents are fighting back against the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They’re making sure that state and local governments acknowledge that their profession is essential so they can keep working. They’re figuring out how to make clients feel comfortable about interactions at a time of masks and gloves and disinfectants, and they’re finding ways to complete just about every stage of the real estate transaction in the virtual world.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You have to give a huge amount of kudos to the real estate community,” said Jeremy Crawford, who runs Atlanta’s Multiple Listing Service. “They learned how to show homes and sell homes and still practice social distancing. ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, this rare cluster of cities saw real estate listings or new inventory grow in the first week of April compared with the same period a year earlier, according to data provided by <span class="companylink">Zillow. com</span> – a remarkable achievement considering that almost every major metropolitan area in the country saw a sharp drop in those categories over the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Opening the Gap: <span class="companylink">Gap Inc</span>. to reopen up to 800 stores by the end of this month, as COVID-19 freeze lifts</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Grim April: 21M job losses, 16% unemployment would reflect just part of the economic damage from the coronavirus</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider Los Angeles, which saw its total listings plunge 30% to around 12,800 as of April 5; or Phoenix, where listings were down 27% to just under 15,000; or Philadelphia, where listings dove 26% to 14,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or ponder new inventory in Detroit, where only 113 new homes came on the market as of April 5 – 65% fewer than last year; or New York, where 532 new homes emerged – a 57% drop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These were massive declines, but not uncommon during COVID-19.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pattern: Cities that suffered the greatest declines in real estate activity were usually in regions where coronavirus landed first – the West Coast – or where the disease hit hardest and governments went into lockdown – the Northeast and upper Midwest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Pennsylvania and Michigan were two states that were very strict about lockdowns,” said Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors. “Visiting a home was a violation there. As a result, Michigan and Pennsylvania real estate activity went down much more than say Virginia or Georgia. ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jennifer Pino, the president of Atlanta Realtors Association, acknowledges that the continued strength of her city’s real estate market is because the outbreak in Georgia came later and was not nearly as severe as in California or New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atlanta’s real estate market was also in hyperdrive prior to COVID-19, Pino said. Inventory was extremely tight – at around the two-month supply level – well below the six-month dividing line that separates a buyer’s market from a seller’s market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But once the pandemic hit, Pino said Realtors in Atlanta petitioned Georgia's governor and the mayor of Atlanta to make sure everyone from agents to appraisers would be able to keep their doors open.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'We don't want people in our homes'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jo Gipson, an assistant broker with Compass Real Estate in Atlanta, said one of the biggest hurdles has been making sure buyers and sellers feel safe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In March there was a pause in the market,” she said. “A bunch of sellers said: 'We don’t want to have people in our homes. ' Everything got put on hold or withdrawn. But that only lasted a couple of weeks until we were able to figure out what was safe. ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Armed with gloves and masks and Purell, agents began to venture out again. They learned to go to homes ahead of time and turn on all the lights and open all the doors so buyers and their agents wouldn’t have to touch anything. They learned not to ride around with clients in their cars. They relied more on virtual tours, walking through homes using FaceTime to show clients every nook and cranny.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We took it really seriously,” Gipson said. “We knew people needed to feel comfortable. ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then came the innovation, according to Tanya Oursler, and agent with Realty Associates of Atlanta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Realtors, mortgage brokers and bankers, title agents and attorneys figured out how to conduct practically every stage of the real estate transaction from showings to closings in the virtual world – the one exception being appraisals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most difficult piece, Oursler said, was the closing. But Georgia ended up allowing virtual notaries to oversee buyers, sellers and their attorneys remotely. The different parties would all appear on Zoom and go through the paperwork. Then the documents would be sent back to the attorney’s office for their official stamps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Whether some or all of this will continue after this, I don’t know,” Oursler said. “But the crisis caused everyone to become more creative. ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Following the rules</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Jason Lee and his wife, Katie, who were about to have their second child, it was the closing of their four-bedroom house that coincided with the outbreak of COVID-19.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With help from Gipson, they found their new home in February in Decatur, a city in northeastern Atlanta. They made an offer in mid-March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the time of the closing, the pandemic was in full swing. Jason Lee, who owns a company that builds and installs pipes and sewage systems, said there was nothing revolutionary about signing in all the right places.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We just followed the rules,” Lee said. “We went to the closing in the attorney’s office. Everyone sat in the conference room – eight feet apart. We all wore gloves and masks. We passed around the documents, and everyone used their own pens. ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added that the room was sanitized prior to their arrival and again after they left.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result of these precautions and innovations, Oursler said Atlanta will not see much of a downturn when the April numbers come out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“While there have been some people who stepped out of the market for a moment, there were lots who stayed in,” Oursler said. “For them, it may have been good timing. With fewer buyers, it might have been easier for them to find what they wanted. ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Crawford, the chief executive of First Multiple Listing Service in Atlanta, listings in his city have dropped 15% since the beginning of April. So home selection has dwindled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Crawford said there’s still plenty of data confirming the strength of Altanta’s market in comparison to other cities across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> data, for example, shows that Atlanta was second in the country in terms of the decline in mortgage applications behind only Dallas. That means more buyers are moving ahead with purchases than practically anywhere else. And while the total number of showings dropped during the pandemic, they’ve staged an impressive comeback.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of April 6, showings of homes in Atlanta bottomed out at 48% below the first week in January, Crawford said. Since then, they’ve increased every single day and are now just 7% below the first week in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That is a substantial change,” Crawford said. “The Atlanta market is not only doing well compared to other regions of the country, it’s doing a pretty darn good job compared to last year. ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The same can be said of Raleigh-Durham, 400 miles to the north.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Freeze frame, then a thaw</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real estate market there was also red hot before COVID-19 and inventory was exceptionally tight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We had two months of inventory or less," said Van Fletcher, a broker/Realtor with Allen Tate Realtors in Raleigh. “Properties were moving at every price point from starter homes to luxury. ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The local economy with its universities and hospitals and concentration of high tech companies was booming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When the initial shock of COVID-19 came, we hit a freeze frame on activity,” Fletcher said. “Showings dropped off. New listings dropped off, and that lasted most of March. That’s when we saw the greatest fear. But things started to thaw a little in April. ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, the market has been relatively strong, especially at the low end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Under $300,000, we’re receiving multiple offers,” said Otto Cedeno, the owner of Movil Realty, a Durham real estate firm. “People are buying properties without seeing them and closing on virtual tours. ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cedeno said his company was selling 130 to 140 homes in February and March, but he’s going to pass 160 in April, and that’s at the height of the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“A lot of people are still moving to this area,” Cedeno said. “I don’t think we’re going to suffer anything. ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'Please be safe'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Realtors in the Raleigh-Durham market did not come together as they did in Atlanta. That’s reflected by the fact that their five-county metropolis is riddled with different rules governing what agents can and cannot do during the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Durham stopped all showings,” said Tricia Manneh, an agent with Choice Residential Real Estate in Raleigh. “You could only show homes that were vacant and you couldn’t go at the same time as the buyer. ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other counties – Wake, which is home to Raleigh, and Chatham – have no restrictions whatsoever.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Realtors say they've been able to keep serving customers by doing virtual tours and video walk-throughs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That’s how Fletcher has been able to keep showing houses to Liz Stokley and Ryan Stephens, a married couple who are planning to move to Raleigh from Baltimore in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephens is a radiologist who will be joining a physician's practice. Stokley is a marketer for Boston Scientific who sells next-generation medical devices to hospitals around the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pair of millennials met with Fletcher and visited five or six houses on a trip to Raleigh in January and they had planned to return in March, but the pandemic made them feel squeamish about airplanes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“So we started doing video tours with Van,” Stokley said. “We felt very lucky that he was willing to go into these houses. "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, Stokley and her husband have looked at about eight houses in the $600,000 range and have made an offer on one of them. But they got beat out by a buyer who was able to close at an earlier date. So the search continues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Statistics show that the Raleigh-Durham market has its weaknesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stacey Anfindsen, a residential market analyst who runs the Triangle Area Residential Report, pointed out that showings were down by more than 20% in March in every county except Johnston County compared with last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“With showings down, pending sales should be down,” Anfindsen said. “But there’s one caveat: virtual showings. I don’t have a way to quantify them. "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, other numbers provided by Anfindsen still look positive. Sales for the first quarter in Raleigh-Durham were up 12%. The average resale price was up 6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cocky drunk confidence</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Texas cities also have shown considerable strength during the pandemic, and none more so than Austin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though total listings were down nearly 6% to just over 5,100 homes as of April 5, new inventory was up 13. 5% – more than any other major metro area in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Sprague, a housing market expert with Independence Title in Austin said there were very few homes for resale before the pandemic hit – less than a two month supply. The only thing that was keeping prices from shooting up too rapidly was a healthy supply of new homes. But while construction has continued through March and April, Sprague said there has not been enough building to cause total listings to rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We did not have inventory going into the crisis and will not have inventory coming out,” Sprague said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added that he usually looks at two indicators when considering the strength of a real estate market – the ability of the local economy to add at least 22,000 jobs a year and consumer confidence. Both are still looking good in Austin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With respect to consumer confidence, as long as it’s between 90 and 110, consumers will still buy houses, Sprague said. If it’s above 110, sellers will receive multiple offers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Before the crisis, consumer confidence was up at 154 in Austin, which is what I would call cocky drunk,” Sprague said. "Since then, consumer confidence has dropped about 30 points. "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that's still above the all-important 110 demarcation line where multiple offers are prevalent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Across the board, my agents are busy,” said Mary Anne McMahon, owner of Re/Max Posh Properties in Austin. “Lower-end properties -- $350,000 through $600,000 – are still receiving multiple offers. ”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales will likely plunge this spring in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, but bounce back by the end of next year, according to a new forecast from real estate search site Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales likely will plummet by up to 60%, as stay-at-home mandates and overall worries about the economy take the steam out of what was previously expected to be a robust spring home-buying season, according to Zillow's economists and analysts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But prices likely will experience a much slighter slide, and a quicker recovery. Zillow expects prices to drop no more than 3% by the end of this year, and then creep back up throughout 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales should also increase by roughly 10% a month through 2021, according to the forecast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Much uncertainty still exists, particularly with some states beginning to reopen and experts warning of a possible second wave of the coronavirus in the fall," Svenja Gudell, Zillow's chief economist said. "However, housing fundamentals are strong, much more so than they were leading into the Great Recession, and that bodes well for housing in general."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before measures to contain the coronavirus escalated in March, the home-buying market was expected to be strong, fueled by historically low interest rates, a limited number of properties for sale and an eagerness by younger Americans to purchase their first homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That demand remains despite economic uncertainty, Zillow says, noting that new listings and pending sales is increasing. And the real estate industry has adapted to the changing environment, using technology to allow for transactions amid social distancing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That means prices will barely budge, unlike during the Great Recession when prices plunged almost 25% and took five years to come back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Despite the difficulties, we're seeing several signs that there is still a good amount of demand for housing and buyers, sellers and agents are growing more comfortable moving transactions forward where possible," Gudell says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">pending home sales plummet amid pandemic</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said Wednesday that its pending home sales index, which measures signed buyer contracts, plummeted a seasonally adjusted 20.8% in March from the previous month to a reading of 88.2. That is the lowest level since May 2011, when the housing market was still dealing with foreclosures and crashing prices from the Great Recession. Pending sales have fallen 16.3% from a year ago.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only half of Americans say now is a good time to buy a home, marking an all-time low as pessimism spreads about the housing market amid the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, according to a new Gallup poll.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 50% of U. S. adults who say it is a good time to purchase a home is the lowest Gallup has measured, 2 percentage points below the prior low in 2006, before the subprime mortgage crisis helped plunge the country into the Great Recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The poll from Gallup's annual Economy and Personal Finance poll, was conducted April 1-14 and comes with a record drop in Americans’ confidence in the economy and in their own personal financial situation.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Americans' opinions about the housing market have shifted dramatically as the U. S. economy has abruptly slowed down in attempts to stop the spread of the coronavirus,” the pollster said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">March sales data from the National Association of Realtors showed an 8. 5% decline in the number of existing home sales, but home values held steady. But economists are forecasting grimmer news in coming months, with record unemployment and the likelihood that the U. S. is already in the grips of a recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More Americans will be cautious about buying or selling homes, and many homeowners who lose their jobs and incomes will struggle to hold onto their homes, Gallup said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new U. S. single-family homes dropped by the most in more than six years in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said Thursday that new home sales fell 15. 4%, the biggest percentage decline since July 2013.</p>

Two teams of port workers will be wearing a bracelet originally designed to find tugboat crew members. The bracelets vibrate when they move to within about 10 feet of each other. The bracelets ensure physical distancing and collect no data.</p>

Construction of single-family houses fell 17.5%, while apartment and condo starts were off 32.1% from a month ago.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">February home sales were highest in more than a decade, but that was before coronavirus</span>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">February home sales were brisk as buyers took advantage of low mortgage rates, but that trend could change as borrowing costs rise and concerns about the coronavirus escalate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of single family homes, condos and co-ops were the highest they'd been in 13 years, according to the National Association of Realtors. Home purchases were also 6. 5% higher than the previous month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“February’s sales of over 5 million homes were the strongest since February 2007,” Lawrence Yun, NAR’s chief economist, said in a statement. “I would attribute that to the incredibly low mortgage rates and the steady release of a sizable pent-up housing demand that was built over recent years. ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But February's activity occurred before concerns about COVID-19 ratcheted up, roiling financial markets, triggering layoffs, and reducing the ability to house hunt in person amid advisories to stay home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The coronavirus has undoubtedly slowed buyer traffic and it is difficult to predict what short-term effects the pandemic will have on future sales,” Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home buying predicted to slow down</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Fitch Ratings</span> says that not only might fewer people buy homes, those who do go through with a purchase may end up paying less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coronavirus could impact home buying: The race to buy a home slows a bit amid coronavirus, but demand is still high</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With coronavirus, who should be on highest alert: Coronavirus: Millions of Americans are especially at risk; here's a breakdown by state</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The broadening spread of coronavirus in the United States will slow down home buying activity and possibly lead to a decline in home prices with a widespread and protracted period of containment,'' the firm said in its latest quarterly home price report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest rates are also on the rise, as lenders try to slow the flood of applications they've received in recent weeks as home owners and buyers rushed to lower their borrowing costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average interest rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage was 3. 65% this week, the highest since mid-January, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. It’s the most significant week to week jump since November 2016. Only two weeks ago, those rates averaged 3. 29%, a record low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As rates began to climb last week, mortgage applications dropped 8. 4% from a week earlier, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Applications to refinance also decreased, dipping 10%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If home buying dips, expect a bounce back soon</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Yun says he believes home prices should hold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Unlike the stock market,'' he says, "home prices are not expected to drop because of the ongoing housing shortage and due to homes getting delisted during this time of crisis. ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And once the crisis ebbs, house hunting should start up again in earnest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Once the social-distancing and quarantine measures are relaxed, we should see this temporary pause evaporate,'' Yun said, "and . . . potential buyers return with the same enthusiasm. ”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the wake of President Donald Trump's travel ban from Europe, Americans are scrambling as they figure out how to get home amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Travelers on Thursday found that prices for major U. S. airlines had soared for flights back to the United States from Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of Thursday at 8 a. m. ET, one-way flights from Paris to New York on Friday through <span class="companylink">United Airlines</span> appear to range from $2,400 to $5,700. From Paris to New York the same day through American Airlines, flights are shown for $2,000 to $7,300 on their website. And for the same parameters, Delta's website shows a range of $2,200 to $5,900.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American Airlines told USA TODAY Thursday that they are placing fare caps on flights to tackle this issue. There are already limited seats on most flights due to the spring break holiday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are placing caps on fares for all cabins, on flights from Europe back to the U. S. that are affected by the government-imposed travel restrictions," the airline said in a statement provided by Senior Manager of Corporate Communications Andrea Koos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">USA TODAY has reached out to <span class="companylink">Delta Airlines</span> and <span class="companylink">United Airlines</span> for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, Delta issued a travel waiver covering flights between the U. S. and Europe, raising the possibility that other carriers would follow suit. Delta said it will waive ticket change fees for passengers traveling to, from or through Europe and the U. K. through May 31. The waiver applies to travelers who purchased tickets before March 11.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Travelers who are scrambling to change or cancel their flights to Europe are also encountering long waits for a response from airline reservation centers and on <span class="companylink">Twitter</span>. One traveler, @Quincy_Avery, asked Delta early Thursday: "I understand I'm sure you guys are swamped. I was given a call back time of 2 hours. It's been over 8 hours looking forward to hearing back soon. "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We don't know what we may have to do once we get back"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tennessee medical assistant Marie Boerger was scheduled to fly from Germany to Atlanta on Sunday but quickly changed her plans when she learned of the new travel restrictions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was 2 a. m. Thursday in Germany and her daughter-in-law started calling <span class="companylink">Delta Air Lines</span> to change their flight. The phone lines were jammed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The wait was 4+ hours or the call would hang up,'' Boerger said via <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> messenger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They decided to go to the airport later in Stuttgart to see if Delta could help. The place was practically empty when they arrived, Boerger said, and they had a new flight within five minutes of arriving. The family is now leaving on a Friday flight through Paris. They did not have to pay any fees or a fare difference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big question now: "We do not know what we may have to do once we get back to the U. S. ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vice President Pence on Thursday said returning passengers will have to self-quarantine for 14 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'We'll figure it out'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Haley Ohlund, a 20-year-old <span class="companylink">George Washington University</span> student, got the news while traveling in Copenhagen after her study abroad program in Florence was canceled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The program moved online and she proceeded with her previously-booked spring break trip. "I was just trying to kill the few days between my program ending and my spring break, which had been completely paid for, and then I had my flight home booked for the end of my spring break in about 10 days," Ohlund said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, everything changed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She booked a flight to leave at 11 a. m. local time on Thursday after seeing reports from the U. S. She "immediately" called her mom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We’ll get you out," her mom told her. "We’ll figure it out. "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her one-way ticket home after Trump's announcement was so expensive that it jumped thousands of dollars in just minutes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When I went to book it was $340 and it ended up being well over $1,000 10 minutes after," she said. "As I was clicking to book it just kept jumping up. " In total? She spent about $1,500 to get from Copenhagen to Pittsburgh.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She's feeling calmer, but disappointed about the money and losing out on experiences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Everything was cut very short and it feels a bit unfair, even though I know that a lot of people are experiencing much worse around the globe," she said. "So I’m trying to be optimistic and looking forward to going home but it’s quite disappointing. "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her university has told her she'd keep her credits but she remains concerned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I hope I’m reimbursed for the housing I paid for," she said, adding that "I’m not sure I’ll get the same education" online as she would have gotten at her program in Florence, from a wine studies education class (which she can’t legally take in the U. S. ) to the ability to tour and learn at Italian museums and cathedrals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'Trying to get home . . . seems illogical'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Raquel Guarino just moved to Italy two-and-a-half weeks ago for a one-year master's program University of Gastronomic Sciences in Pollenzo, Italy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, she feels safer there than she would flying back to the U. S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If I decided to go to home, I looked it up and with flights being canceled, I'd need to pass through at least three international airports crowded with people from all over Europe," the 28-year-old told USA TODAY. "Considering one of the advisories is to avoid crowded areas, trying to get home when thousands of others are doing the same seems illogical," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When she landed in Milan on Feb. 23, she didn't know the virus had gotten to Italy. They took her temperature at the airport and she soon found out why.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At that point I saw a few people with masks on at the airport and in Milan but it wasn't a big deal," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Guarino dreamed of moving to Italy for almost 10 years and wanted "to do all kinds of traveling this year. " Now, that's on hold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Every few days the situation here gotten slightly more intense," Guarino said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within a few days of landing, she was told her program would be delayed a few days. Then, with each government announcement, a few more days. It was most recently delayed until April 15. She was supposed to start her program on March 11.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She feels safe since she's in the small town of Bra, a place with approximately 30,000 people about two hours from Milan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Most outsiders don't really have a reason to visit here, and many folks in the town are very serious about containment and restricting activities," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another concern: Would she be able to return to Italy at all if she left?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I've rented a place for a year and have just settled down here. So not knowing if I could come back to my place makes the situation more overwhelming. There really doesn't seem to be much information on that at all. "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'Get out now'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Salvador Ochoa, a music photographer in Los Angeles, and his family were set to board a <span class="companylink">Virgin Atlantic</span> flight from London to San Francisco on Thursday after a recommendation from a Virgin Atlantic agent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She told them the situation is "changing rapidly. " "She suggested we try and get out now that we can," Ochoa told USA TODAY.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He had been traveling with his two sisters and their husbands and kids as well as his brother. They went to Paris, Madrid and London was their last stop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We got to London last night and didn’t get a chance to sight see when we were awaken by 2 a. m. text messages from family in <span class="companylink">Yuba City</span> (in California) to get back ASAP," Ochoa said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're searching for a home this spring, get ready for a fight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bidding wars are likely because mortgage rates are low, demand is strong, and the amount of homes for sale is down – way down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"January has already been strong with prices up, home sales up, (and) listings . . . down quite a bit,'' says Daryl Fairweather, chief economist with RedFin. "So homebuyers are more likely to face competition. " She thinks sales will still be strong, simply because more buyers will pull the trigger on buying homes. ’</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The coronavirus remains a wild card, however. The outbreak of COVID-19 is helping drive down mortgage rates as jittery investors shift from stocks to bonds. But the virus might deter some house hunters who are worried about their jobs, their 401(k)'s) and their physical health.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The recent developments with coronavirus may throw a wrench in these patterns we've been seeing,'' Fairweather says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fewer homes mean higher prices</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last spring, buyers had more of an upper hand as more properties came on the market and sellers tried to woo back house hunters turned off by high prices and higher interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now buyers have fewer choices. At the end of January, there were 1. 42 million units, including condos, co-ops and single-family homes on the market, up 2. 2% from December, but down 10. 7% from the same time last year, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">January's housing inventory was the lowest it's been in 21 years, according to NAR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fewer homes coupled with high demand means higher prices. In January, the median sale price for housing including condos, single-family dwellings and new construction was $306,000, up 6. 7% from a year ago, according to Redfin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates continue to drop</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But mortgage rates continue to drop as concerns about the coronavirus roil financial markets, leading the Federal Reserve to take the surprise step of cutting key rates by half a percentage point this week and more investors to put their money in bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rates for a 30-year fixed mortgage dropped to 3. 56% this week, the lowest since October 2016, according to Bankrate's weekly survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low rates are a key reason the greater Boston metropolitan area has less than two months of single-family home inventory available for sale, says Jason Gell, president of the Greater Boston Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyer tips</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't give up - "Be patient,'' says Lautz. "You may have to bid on several properties before you beat out the competition for that home. ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Work with a broker - “That local realtor will know how to sweeten the pot for that potential seller, and make your offer the most attractive,'' Lautz added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Go the extra mile - Consider writing the seller a letter. “It doesn’t cost the buyer anything to write a nice little letter about how much they like the home,'' Fairweather says. "But other financial incentives, like having an all-cash offer, shortening the escrow terms, waiving contingencies and offering more money, obviously . . . help to,o. ’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sellers advice</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spruce it up - "Even in this tight inventory environment, homebuyers' expectations have risen,'' says Lautz. "When they come into homes, they expect them to look like TV shows. They expect them to be staged. They're attracted to beautiful photos online. . . . Those types of factors really do matter. ’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't get greedy - "An overpriced home is still going to sit on the market,'' Gell says. "With the right price, you're likely to get a bidding war. ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Know where you're moving before you hand over the keys - Have a plan for what you will do after you sell your home, whether that's staying in temporary housing, or buying another property before the sale of your house closes if you have enough cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While it may be very easy for them to sell their home. . . it may take multiple tries to buy a home, especially in more competitive markets,’’ says Fairweather. "What's difficult for sellers is . . . getting that timing exactly right. ''</p>
