<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A more confident consumer is giving a lift to the improving job market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy added a better-than-expected 171,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department said Friday. A healthy portion of the additions came from sectors such as retail and construction that were lagging but now are benefiting from a more bullish consumer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retail employment rose by 36,000 in October, the most since January 2011, and it's up by 82,000 since August, the biggest three- month increase in several years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Households are starting to contribute more to the economic recovery," says Mark Zandi, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics. The recovering housing market, in particular, is bolstering employment in several sectors, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Diane Swonk, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Mesirow Financial</span>, says rising home prices are making consumers feel wealthier, and mortgage refinancings are putting more cash in their pockets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reports last week showed chain-store sales rose briskly last month and consumer confidence reached the highest level since February 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vehicle sales, though down slightly from the 41/2-year highs hit in September, are still 7.2% above a year ago as consumers continue to replace aging vehicles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And home sales and housing starts are picking up noticeably.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The accelerating activity is filtering into payrolls, adding diversity to a labor market that largely had been driven by job gains in professional and business services, health and education, and business travel-related services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have seen a better mix of job growth," says <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> economist Marisa DiNatale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within the retail industry, auto and auto-parts dealers added 7,300 jobs last month, a two-year high. Although department stores trimmed jobs, discount stores such as <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span> added employees as middle-income consumers hunt for bargains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps most encouraging: Furniture and home furnishing stores, which were battered in the recession, have added about 7,000 jobs the past three months as rising home sales spark more furniture purchases. After cutting its staff by 17% in the recession to 2,500, Western furniture chain R.C. Willey added employees this year -- about 55 -- for the first time in several years, says President Jeff Child.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Las Vegas, "People are now buying (homes) to live in" rather than as investments, prompting more flooring and appliance sales, Child says. Revenue this year is up nearly 10%, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet long-term shifts in retailing to online sales and the spread of technology, such as self-service checkout, will likely limit the pace of employment advances, says Jack Kleinhenz, chief economist at the <span class="companylink">National Retail Federation</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other industries benefiting from awakening consumers:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction companies added 17,000 employees last month, the most since January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Specialty trade contractors, such as plumbers and electricians, accounted for much of the increase as home building and remodeling surged, says Ken Simonson, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Associated General Contractors of America</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturers of wood products, including goods for the housing industry, have added 4,200 jobs since July after cutting payrolls steadily in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A financial services sector that includes mortgage brokers has added about 10,000 jobs since June on a non-seasonally adjusted basis. That industry also had been shedding workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Food services and drinking places added 23,000 jobs in October and have added 320,000 over the past year.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As homeownership rates continue to fall, a new type of single- family home buyer has emerged: large corporate investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With house values still depressed in many areas, investment funds and real estate trusts have been scooping up thousands of foreclosures across the U.S. in hopes of managing houses the same way large real estate funds hold apartment complexes and office buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That trend has accelerated recently as <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> announced its first two bulk sales of foreclosed homes to investment companies, selling 94 Chicago properties and 699 in Florida to firms that have pledged to rent them for at least three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal mortgage-finance giant expects to sell nearly 2,000 units, the majority of them single-family homes, as part of a pilot program to stabilize cities hit hard by the housing crisis and to lighten its portfolio of foreclosed houses, which in June numbered about 109,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're in unprecedented times," said Don Cogsville, chief executive of The Cogsville Group, an investment company that bought the Chicago houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until now, his firm has focused on distressed commercial properties and multi-family housing complexes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We view (single-family housing) as a real continuation of our strategy," Cogsville said, adding that his company wants to buy more homes to gain economies of scale needed to manage scattered properties. "It is different, but it's doable."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cogsville offered $11.8 million on the Chicago homes, putting $2 million down and agreeing to pay the rest over time by splitting rental income with <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What remains to be seen is how the new ownership will affect neighborhoods, and how long investment firms will stick around if prices rebound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"No one really has a crystal ball as to how this is all going to play out," Cogsville said. "Time will tell the commitment institutions make to these local markets. But right now, institutional capital coming in is really going to help stabilize these communities."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bulk sales have drawn some critics. The California Association of Realtors has said <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>'s program takes ownership out of local hands and fails to publicly disclose the exact locations and sale prices of the properties bought by investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some also worry a glut of rentals will hurt neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We need home buyers in the properties," said Sharon Bowler, chairwoman of the California Association of Realtors' distressed property task force. "When you put this amount of rentals in one community, your housing values are going to drop."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But studies show clusters of empty homes can invite crime and hurt home values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's growing evidence that vacant, abandoned foreclosed properties are not good for communities," said Ingrid Gould Ellen, co-director of NYU's Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy, who has studied how foreclosures affect neighborhoods. "It's surely a lot better to have a renter in a property than have a property that's vacant."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2011, homeownership dropped to 64.6%, the lowest in the past seven years, according to Census Bureau data. Single-family homes have steadily become a larger share of the rental market, rising from 30.8% in 2005 to 34.1% of all rental properties in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About two-thirds of the nation's metro regions saw the number of single-family rentals grow by at least 10% in the past seven years. Roughly half -- including Phoenix, San Diego, Indianapolis, Detroit, Philadelphia, New York and Orlando -- saw the number of owner-occupied homes shrink in the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Institutional investors are poised to become a bigger force in the housing market in the months to come.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September, the newly formed <span class="companylink">Silver Bay Realty Trust Corp</span>. became the first entity to seek an IPO for its single-family-home real estate trust. It hopes to raise $287.5 million. <span class="companylink">Two Harbors Investment Corp</span>., which spent $150 million this year to enter the single-family market, contributed its portfolio of homes to the new venture. It partnered with another investment firm to create a pool of 2,250 houses in five states by the end of August, according to a regulatory filing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That level of spending isn't unusual, or even that large. In June, Colony Capital officials told USA TODAY they planned to invest $1.5 billion in the single-family rental market in the upcoming year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Colony owns about 3,000 houses, and expects to own and manage 15,000 to 20,000 houses by the end of 2013, the company said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It may sound like a lot, but if you put it in perspective here, we have a million foreclosures a year," said Mark Willis, the Furman Center's resident research fellow. He's heard other firms talking about similar scales of operation: "Ten thousand is a number they all like."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other companies also have plans for expansion. In Phoenix, American Residential Properties President Laurie Hawkes said her company, with more than 1,500 houses in five states, hopes to take its real estate investment trust public next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many say the job would be impossible without sophisticated database systems and a careful eye on which properties they scoop up. Picking the right market -- one with deteriorated home values but a rosy economic outlook -- also matters. Hawkes said that made Phoenix, for instance, a better market for institutional homeownership than some Rust Belt cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with renters in complexes, single-family renters tend to be older, have children and have higher incomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We appeal to families," Hawkes said. "Many of them are former homeowners. They are people who still want to have houses to live in."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Left to be seen is how many firms stay in the single-family rental business. If sales prices increase, it could cut off discount buying, and make it more tempting for companies to sell their stock of homes. Eventually, many rentals could return to owner occupancy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Census data show the largest percentage drop-off in homeownership is among those under 35. That indicates people are putting off buying, not abandoning it altogether, Ellen said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We think of single-family homes as owner occupied," she said. "But those homes transition in and out. I don't think these properties are now permanently rental properties. There's nothing about becoming a rental that means they can't transition back."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recovery in home construction is finally building strength to help the economy for the first time in years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home construction market registered "blowout" numbers in September, IHS Global Insight says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts were up 15% from August, the Commerce Department reported, with increases in every region of the U.S. except the Northeast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing permits, which are less volatile than starts and indicate future building, rose 11.6% and posted solid gains in all four U.S. regions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strong numbers, while they may not be repeated in coming months, are "good solid evidence" that the housing recovery is underway, says David Crowe, chief economist at the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> (NAHB).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing typically leads the U.S. economy out of recession. It hasn't this time, given the depth of the crash that knocked down home prices by 30% and left behind a string of dismal years for new construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in recent quarters, housing has shown improving vital signs, with rising prices and year-over-year increases in existing and new home sales. Since World War II, housing has contributed an average 4.7% annually to the growth in U.S. gross domestic product, the NAHB says. That's rebounded to more than 10% this year, Crowe says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home construction is closely watched because it's labor intensive. The industry lost more than 2 million jobs since the housing bubble burst. Few have come back, Crowe says. When people buy new homes, they also unleash spending for goods such as appliances and furniture -- and that generates jobs in other industries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Housing is now contributing to the economy," says Michael Lea, director of San Diego State University's Corky McMillin Center for Real Estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, home builders began construction on 434,000 single- family homes, the worst year on record. This year, single-family starts will be up 21% from last year, the NAHB forecasts, and then increase 26% and 30% in the next two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the upbeat trend of recent housing data, some housing experts warn of headwinds. Falling interest rates this year have probably pulled some demand forward, says Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist for Mizuho Securities.</p>

</div><div class="author">Paul Davidson   </div><div>Paul Davidson, @PDavidsonusat, USA TODAY</div>
<div>566 words</div><div>11 October 2012</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.4</div><div>English</div><div>© 2012 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy grew modestly in late August and early September, with activity picking up in 10 of 12 districts, the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> said in a report Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economic activity leveled off in the New York area and slowed in the Kansas City region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed's beige book, named for the color of its cover, was slightly more tempered than the report on the previous six-week period, which showed modest or moderate growth in nine of 12 <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> bank districts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The job market was little changed despite a government report last week that said unemployment in September fell to 7.8% from 8.1%, according to a survey of households.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employment was flat or up slightly in the Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, Minneapolis and Dallas areas but weaker in New York and Chicago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Uncertainty about looming tax increases and spending cuts, the presidential election and the European financial crisis all restrained hiring, the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, employers in several areas said they were having trouble finding skilled employees -- continuing a paradox that has bedeviled the jobs recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This report, the last before the presidential election, reflects an economy that most analysts believe grew at a tepid annual pace of 1.5% to 2% in the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real estate market continued to climb out of a years-long slump, but consumer spending was up only slightly, manufacturing was mixed, and the job market was little changed, with uncertain businesses holding back on hiring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the bright side, the housing market "showed widespread improvement," the report said, with all 12 districts reporting stronger existing home sales, "in some cases substantially."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sale prices were steady or rising in the Boston, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Dallas and San Francisco regions amid tight housing inventories, while the market tilted to low-to-midprice home sales in Boston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, multifamily construction was "robust" in several large cities, including Boston, New York, Atlanta and Chicago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commercial real estate market -- typically, a barometer of the job market -- softened in the Northeast and picked up some in Atlanta, Minneapolis and San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer spending was "flat to up slightly," with retail sales improving modestly in areas including Cleveland, Atlanta and San Francisco, but flat or softer in the New York and Kansas City regions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising gasoline prices, weather and "political uncertainty" dampened sales, and Atlanta and San Francisco reported that discounters are doing better than department stores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vehicle sales, a recent bright spot in a plodding economy, were running ahead of last year's levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And tourism bolstered the economies of regions such as Boston, New York, Philadelphia and Atlanta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturing was also mixed, with "significant gains" in activity related to construction, energy and transportation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But steel production was flat in Cleveland, the high-tech sector was sluggish, and machinery- and equipment-related production fell in the Philadelphia, Chicago and Kansas City areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The European financial crisis and recession have hurt U.S. exporters, particularly manufacturers, in recent months. Factory orders fell sharply last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A drought that has ravaged crops in the Midwest continued to hurt farmers in the Chicago and Minneapolis areas, though increased rainfall improved crops in the Chicago and Dallas regions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Activity also improved in the Atlanta and St. Louis areas.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home prices are coming off the bottom faster than many expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Market researcher <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> says prices were up 4.6% in August from a year ago, the largest year-over-year gain in six years. The report parallels others showing recent strengthening in home prices, which are still down about 30% from their 2006 peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the recent increase is tied to tightening supplies of homes for sale. In August, existing single-family home sales were up 9% year over year, but the supply of listed homes for sale was down 18%, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Inventories drive prices," says Christopher Thornberg, an economist with Beacon Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As home prices rise, more people will eventually list homes for sale. And as they do, price gains may slow, says Zillow economist Stan Humphries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">August was the sixth consecutive month that home prices were up on a month-over-month basis, <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> says. That's a reversal from last fall when prices were still falling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> expects September home prices were up 5% year-over- year, too. But it says they likely slipped 0.3% in September from August as summer ended.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the housing market lately has shown a strength that was not evident last year or even last spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, some housing experts thought home prices would fall through 2012. There were fears that lenders would flood the market with foreclosed homes, driving drive down prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That hasn't happened. What's more, low mortgage interest rates -- which last week reached an all-time low average of 3.4% for a fixed 30-year loan -- and better consumer confidence are helping demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As people perceive that prices have bottomed, they're coming back into the market," says Mark Goldman, real estate expert at San Diego State University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher prices help homeowners build equity. In the first half of this year, 1.3 million homeowners moved from being underwater -- owing more on their mortgages than their homes were worth -- into positive equity status, <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More will cross that bar if prices keep rising. That enables more people to sell or refinance into lower-cost loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zillow predicts home prices rise modestly for two to four years, given high unemployment and the many borrowers still underwater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 20% of homeowners with mortages remain underwater, says <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>. Zillow's estimate is 30%.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices are continuing to improve, further evidence of the housing market's growing health.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices in July rose 1.6% from June and 0.4% when adjusted for seasonal factors, according to the 20-city <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case- Shiller index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increases have been broad as prices rose for the third- consecutive month in all 20 cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Year over year, Case-Shiller's data show home prices up 1.2%. Phoenix led the way with a 17% jump. After Phoenix, the biggest year- over-year gainers were Minneapolis, up 6.4%; Detroit, up 6.2%; and Denver, up 5.4%. Atlanta remained the laggard, down almost 10% year over year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"All in all, we are more optimistic about housing," says David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S&amp;P/Dow Jones Indices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller report follows other recent good news about housing. Existing home sales were up 8% in August from July, single- family home starts were also up, and foreclosures are slowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers are more optimistic, too. The Conference Board said Tuesday that its consumer confidence index this month reached its highest level since February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Further home price increases are likely as long as the U.S. avoids recession, says Patrick Newport, IHS Global Insight economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He calls the recent home price gains a "game changer" for the economy and says they'll help in "small and different ways."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One effect of rising home prices is to help homeowners build equity. In the first half of this year, 1.3 million homeowners moved from being underwater -- owing more on their mortgages than their homes were worth -- into positive equity status, says market researcher <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fewer underwater homes will lead to fewer defaults and enable more people to refinance and take advantage of interest rates near all-time lows. They averaged 3.55% for a 30-year fixed-rate loan for the week ended Sept. 13, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Increased refinancing will give more consumers more money to spend, Newport says. Higher home prices will give builders more room to raise prices. Higher prices may also boost home sales by enabling more owners to sell homes and move up to others, Newport adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home price increases are likely to soften in the fall, as they typically do after the stronger spring and summer seasons, says Jed Kolko, economist for real estate website <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>. But overall, Capital Economics expects home prices to rise 5% this year and a similar amount next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices are rising in part because distressed properties now are a smaller share of overall sales. The supply of homes for sale is also tighter -- 6.1 months in August vs. 8.2 months a year earlier, says the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market's rebound is gaining strength as foreclosure sales slow and more people who are not in financial trouble put their homes on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New signs are adding to recent evidence of housing's upward momentum:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales in August were the strongest since May 2010. They rose 7.8% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.82 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> reported Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">August housing starts rose 2.3% from July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 750,000, the Commerce Department said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders are getting ebullient. On Tuesday, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> reported that builders' confidence is the highest since 2006. The NAHB's list of improving local markets now includes hard-hit areas such as Jacksonville and Tucson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing prices have fallen so sharply that the ratio of home prices to incomes is now near the average from 1985 to 2000, said Stan Humphries, chief economist at real estate website <span class="companylink">Zillow.com</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Factor in interest rates, and house payments are 16% easier for today's average buyer than they were for a decade and a half before the bubble, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Prices have gotten so low, and affordability so high, that buyers have come off the fence," Humphries said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday's data show that the supply of homes added to the market is rising, even as foreclosure sales slow, meaning regular buyers and sellers are gaining confidence, <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics economist Celia Chen said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand is growing even faster than new supply, putting pressure on prices, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national median existing-home price was $187,400 in August, up 9.5% from a year ago, the Realtors said. The increase was the biggest since January 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stable prices are bringing out buyers who hesitated while values were falling, said Stephen Paul, executive vice president of Mid- Atlantic Builders in Rockville, Md.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His summer sales tripled this year, to 15 units from five last year. Low-down-payment mortgages backed by the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span> are filling gaps remaining in private financing markets, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We had our best summer in seven years," Paul said. "If I'm selling in July and August, when markets are in hibernation, people are looking to buy in a serious way."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Wall Street prepares for today's report on housing sales prices, some experts argue that the gold-standard index for tracking the market may be falling behind the times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case-Shiller index for home sales closed in June is expected to show a 1.5% decline from this time last year and a seasonally adjusted gain of 0.1% from May, according to <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics. But data compiled by sites such as Trulia.com suggest asking prices are now rising faster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are higher asking prices unrealistic, or is Case-Shiller compiled too slowly to catch the turn? And do higher asking prices signal an approaching return to mid-single-digit annual appreciation, after housing's 33% tumble since 2006?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It suggests that we'll continue to see increases in the Case- Shiller at least through September, which will be the sales they report in November," Trulia chief economist Jed Kolko said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Case-Shiller's data are relatively slow for two reasons. The homes it reports on have to be sold. Second, the laborious process of compiling data from top markets to calculate the national index takes long enough that June figures are just coming out. Prices for those homes may have been set as long ago as March or April. Case- Shiller's authors think that's a worthy tradeoff for greater accuracy, says David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, asking prices rose 1.2% in the three months that ended in July, compared with the prior three months, according to <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>. They climbed 4% or more in at least 10 markets, including Birmingham, Ala., and Omaha.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Opinion is divided over whether this can last.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Realogy</span>, parent company of Coldwell Banker and Century 21, said Aug. 7 that July sales prices rose by "mid-single digits," which it expects to last through year's end. At <span class="companylink">HomeServices of America</span>, the second-biggest national realty firm, executives said higher asking prices are sticking in many markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the jump may prove premature, said Stan Humphries, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Zillow.com</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Slower job growth in the second quarter, plus expectations of slower second-half expansion and federal budget austerity next year, could scare buyers, he said. And a shortage of lower-price homes for sale may be inflating asking prices, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I hesitate to say, 'Don't look at (asking prices),' but a lot is going on," he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales kept up their recovery in July, but the market's slow progress makes some economists question why record-low mortgage rates aren't having a bigger impact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said sales of previously occupied homes rose 2.3% from June, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.47million. That was still the second-worst pace of the year and followed a decline in June. A 5.5 million rate is considered healthy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of homes sold rose 9.4% from a year ago -- the sharpest increase since January 2006 -- but the gain may be deceptively large. The Realtors association says that higher median prices are due to fewer sales of small, less-expensive homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price gains also reflect a smaller percentage of foreclosure- related distress sales, <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics economist Mike Zoller said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Distressed homes -- including foreclosures and other properties sold at steep discounts from market value -- accounted for 24% of July sales compared with 29% a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another reason lower-priced homes are in short supply is many owners are still in financial distress five years into the housing bust, said Stan Humphries, chief economist of real estate website Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost half of homeowners younger than 40 owe more on their homes than they are worth, keeping cheaper homes off the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That skews statistics by making the Realtors' median sales price, which reached $187,300 last month, reflect a different mix of homes than it once did.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Appreciation will go flat once people are out of having negative equity and put their homes on the market," Humphries said. "As people sense a recovery is afoot, they may price their homes higher and be disappointed."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">July's sales pace missed economists' expectations for an annual rate of about 4.52 million home sales, says <span class="companylink">UBS</span> economist Drew Matus. One reason is that credit continues to be relatively tight, as former homeowners who consented to short sales or lost homes to foreclosure are largely unable to get loans for new properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Yun, the Realtors association's chief economist, said sales could be stronger if not for "unnecessarily tight lending standards and shrinking inventory supplies."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Mortgage interest rates have been at record lows this year while rents have been rising at faster rates," Yun said. "Combined, these factors are helping to unleash a pent-up demand."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to a record-low 3.55% in July compared with 4.55% in July 2011, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Worries about jobs also may be keeping some home buyers on the sidelines, after job growth slipped in the second quarter, said Patrick Newport, an economist at IHS Global Insight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These are not great numbers," Newport said. "We have record-low mortgage rates. Something is going on."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists have predicted the housing market will begin slowly reversing its more than 30% slide in prices since the 2006 peak, though most do not expect substantial price gains until at least 2013 or 2014.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investment opinions are like, um, noses: Everyone has one. Buy stocks, sell bonds? Go long steel and short copper? Buy sheep, sell deer?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's pretty easy to see both sides of an investment argument. But it's hard to argue against buying a house now, assuming you can get a loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing cycle is a long one, in part because buying a house moves at a glacial pace, at least compared with the time it takes to buy a stock or bond. If you're not pre-approved for a mortgage, you have to submit to a credit check, which, these days, is only slightly less intrusive than a CIA background check. You have to get the home inspected. You have to figure out the various fees your bank charges, including the one marked "Just because we can."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How long is a housing cycle? Pretty long. A relatively modest housing bubble, by today's standards, occurred in Boston in the late 1980s. Average home prices, adjusted for inflation, hit $310,000 in October 1987. Home prices didn't hit that level again until May of 2000. Someone who bought at the high had a long wait to get even -- particularly in light of the standard broker's commission of 6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices bottomed, however, in March 1993 -- roughly six years after the top. History doesn't repeat itself precisely, but it's interesting to note that the top of the last housing bubble was six years ago, in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why be bullish on housing?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices. You can always buy low and watch prices go lower. But by many measures, home prices are still cheap. The median single- family home price -- half higher, half lower -- hit its nadir in January, dropping to $154,600, the lowest since October 2001, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. That's down from a high of $230,900 in July 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home prices rose in June to a median $190,100, up 8% from June 2011. Those are still 2003 levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supply. The good news is that the enormous supply on the market is shrinking. It takes a wearisome amount of time for supply to shrink, in part because there are people who have been wanting to sell their homes for many years, but haven't been able to get the price they want. As prices rise, more homes come on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, Ned Davis Research, a respected institutional research firm, estimates that excess supply of houses on the market should be eliminated by the end of 2013. When excess supply dries up, people start building more new houses, which has the virtuous effect of reducing the unemployment rate and increasing the economy generally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates. The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rate is 3.59%, according to mortgage giant <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. That's above the all- time low of 3.49% the week of July 26, but close enough. It's conceivable that at some point in the next 30 years, your interest rate would be less than the rate of inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Assuming you financed 80% of the median single-family home, or $152,080, your mortgage payment would be about $691, excluding taxes and other irritations. About $5,589 of your first year's payments would be tax-deductible mortgage interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thanks mainly to low home prices and interest rates, the NAR's housing affordability index rose to its highest level on record. (The higher the index, the more affordable the average home. The index also takes into account average family income, which has been falling since 2008.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What could go wrong? All sorts of things. You may not be able get a loan. Bankers are insisting on checking things that seemed far too troublesome during the housing bubble, like whether you have a decent credit rating, a down payment, or a job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other problem is that houses are leveraged investments -- that is, you borrow money to buy them. Let's consider the example above, where someone buys a $190,100 house and finances $152,080.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Your investment is $38,020. Let's say that the worst happens: Home prices fall, and you have to sell the house for $175,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately, the bank won't split the loss with you. You'll get back $22,920 from the sale, and wave goodbye to $15,100 of your down payment. That's a 40% loss, even though your house has fallen 8% in value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are other risks with homeownership, ranging from termites to ghosts in the hall closet. But if you're planning to live in your home for a long time, you have the money, and you can get financing, it's a fine time to buy.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home values have risen four consecutive months, <span class="companylink">Zillow.com</span> said Tuesday, a trend that led the housing website to declare that the market has turned the corner from its five-year slump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"After four months with rising home values and increasingly positive forecast data, it seems clear that the country has hit a bottom in home values," said Stan Humphries, chief economist at Seattle-based Zillow, which measures home values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The housing recovery is holding together despite lower-than- expected job growth, indicating that it has some organic strength of its own."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its home value index in the second quarter rose on an annual basis for the first time since 2007, increasing 0.2% compared with last year's second quarter, to $149,300, according to Zillow. Going back to March, values have now risen four months in a row.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zillow's index is a measure of the value of single-family residences, condominiums and units in housing cooperatives, regardless of whether those homes sold within a given period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index is calculated using Zillow's method for estimating home values in a given geographic area on a given day. The index is based on data from more than 80 million homes, Zillow says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zillow's index differs from other indexes that track prices of recently sold homes, such as the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the latest numbers from that better-known index, home prices rose in nearly all major U.S. cities in April from March, further evidence of a housing market that is slowly improving even while the job market slumps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second-quarter data showed annual increases in home values in nearly one-third of the metropolitan areas that it tracks, or 53 of 167. Phoenix posted the largest increase, with values rising 12.1% from last year's second quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zillow forecasts that home values will increase the next year in nearly 43% of the markets it tracks, with Phoenix expected to lead with a 9.9% increase, followed by Miami with a 6.1% gain. U.S. home values are expected to rise 1.1% overall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Of course, there is still some risk as we look down the foreclosure pipeline and see foreclosure starts picking up," Humphries said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That would result in a greater supply of homes being offered for sale by the end of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"But we think demand will rise to absorb that, particularly in markets where there are acute inventory shortages now," Humphries said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts jumped 6.9% in June to a 3-year high, underscoring the housing market's slow recovery as a bright spot in a sputtering economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of homes and apartments rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 760,000 in June, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. That exceeded analysts' estimates and was the highest level since October 2008. Single-family home starts increased 4.7% to 539,000, highest since March 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permit applications fell 3.7% to a seasonally adjusted pace of 755,000, but the decline was driven by a 10.9% drop in multifamily permits, which can be volatile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After hitting all-time lows in the recession, single-family starts picked up the second half of last year and kicked into higher gear in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're finally starting to get some traction," says Robert Denk, senior economist for the National Association of Homebuilders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the housing market is still far from healthy. IHS Global Insight expects 765,000 homes to be built this year, up from 612,000 in 2011, but that's about half a normal volume, says IHS economist Patrick Newport. He says it will take three to four years for construction activity to return to normal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Credit conditions remain tight and nearly a quarter of homeowners owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth, keeping them from moving to new units. And foreclosures continue to dump homes on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But employers have added nearly 4 million jobs since early 2010, prompting young adults living with parents or friends to rent apartments or buy homes, Newport says. Meanwhile, inventories of about 144,000 new homes are near record lows and less than half the normal supply, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stabilizing prices are giving some Americans the confidence to trade up to new homes. "There's a lot of pent-up demand," Denk says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After hampering the economy the past few years, the housing market is expected to add about a quarter of a point to estimated economic growth of 2% this year, Newport says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ed Kopal, owner of Kopal Building and Design in Tyler, Texas, plans to build 12 to 14 homes this year, up from five last year. For the first time in several years, he's building homes worth at least $1 million as well as a community of 32 houses that don't have buyers yet. Buyers want to take advantage of low interest rates, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mid-Atlantic Builders of Rockville, Md., signed seven new home contracts last month, its best June since 2004, says Executive Vice President Stephen Paul. Many customers sold homes in the downturn, and were renting and waiting for the market to recover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They have housing needs," he says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scott Andresen would love to sell his Seattle house. He just can't afford to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 41-year-old policeman and his wife, Rebecca, an environmental consultant, bought the house six years ago. Because of falling prices, they now owe at least $25,000 more on it than it's worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple would like to move to a better neighborhood with better schools for their children, ages 7 and 4. But they'd have to write a check to cover the difference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We can't get out, because it would be too expensive," Andresen says. "It's very frustrating."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners like the Andresens inhabit just about every housing market nationwide, and their reluctance to sell is having an unexpected impact on the U.S. housing market, which is showing signs of stabilizing after years of declining prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rather than a housing market defined by weak demand and falling prices, the market is now being hampered by a restricted supply of homes for sale as demand improves. That's leading to multiple offers in dozens of markets, rising prices in some and a more volatile housing recovery than many expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When you get (houses priced) under $125,000, it's like a frenzy," said Linda Schlitt-Gonzalez, owner-broker of a Coldwell Banker franchise in Vero Beach, Fla. "It's not unusual to have five offers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Negative equity, also known as being underwater, is a big part of the issue. Nationwide, almost three of 10 homeowners with mortgages have no equity in their homes or less than 5% equity, says market researcher <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>. Those homeowners would have to write a check in a traditional sale, so many are not selling. Other homeowners, seeing prices rise or stabilize after falling for six years, are holding out for more price increases, Realtors and real estate experts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We thought, if demand was there, there would always be sellers. But instead the supply is sitting on the sidelines," says Stan Humphries, economist for real estate website Zillow. "The inventory phenomenon will make for a more volatile housing recovery than what we initially expected," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices in certain markets may rise faster than expected, given shortages of homes for sale, then level off when homeowners and home builders add to supplies and banks unload more financially distressed properties, Humphries says. He had expected home prices to stop declining, then level off for years before trending up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nation had a 6.6-month supply of homes for sale in May, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> reported. That's considered a balanced market. But NAR also reported "broad-based shortages" of lower-priced homes for sale in much of the country outside of the Northeast, "extremely tight" supplies in most price ranges in the West and "widespread" inventory shortages in much of Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the 18 major markets tracked by real estate brokerage Redfin, 10 had less than a three-month supply of homes for sale in May. Those included Seattle, Phoenix, Denver, Sacramento, the San Francisco Bay Area, Washington, D.C., and parts of Southern California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tara and Steve Andersen are seeing the low inventory up close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They're not selling their Southern California home, because they can't find anything to buy. Their town, Placentia, now has just a one-month supply of homes for sale, says data tracker ReportsOnHousing.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Andersens started looking a year ago to move from their 2,100- square-footer into a bigger house with a pool. "We were looking for the house we wanted to live in forever," says Tara Andersen, 43, a professional fundraiser and mother of four.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With low interest rates, "We figured it was a good time to do that," she says. They estimate they have almost $200,000 in equity in their $550,000 home, which they've owned for 12 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple bid on a handful of homes, but each received about a dozen offers, Andersen says. Meanwhile, "prices have inched up," she says, and some homes have moved out of their price range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rather than move, the couple are considering adding a pool to their home. "We're feeling kind of stuck," Andersen says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phoenix hit hard</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The impact of limited home supplies may be most evident in Phoenix, a major market that was pummeled by foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April, Phoenix-area home prices were up 9% year-over-year, according to <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case-Shiller home price data. Nationally, prices were down 1.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Phoenix region had 50% fewer homes for sale in May than it did a year earlier, says Michael Orr, real estate expert at <span class="companylink">Arizona State University</span>. Nationally, the May year-over-year drop was 20%, NAR says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For homes under $250,000, buyer competition is intense. Multiple offers are common. One home recently got 95 offers, Orr says, and sold for 17% above its listing price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orr says Phoenix prices may level off during the hot summer months, when buying activity typically slows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phoenix-area foreclosures are also going up as banks work through more distressed loans in the wake of a national settlement earlier this year between state and federal officials and major mortgage servicers, Orr says. That will increase supplies, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, the flow of bank-owned homes coming to market slowed 18 months ago, adding to the inventory crunch, but it may pick up again, as it has in Phoenix.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fears that banks will flood the market with foreclosed homes, however, have been "scaled back," given that they haven't so far and that they are modifying more distressed loans, says Herb Blecher, senior vice president of mortgage tracker LPS Applied Analytics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Its good for prices to go up, but you see crazy things happening," Orr says. "In order for us to see a more stable housing recovery, the basic rule of economics requires prices to change enough to bring a new wave of sellers on the market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of those prospective sellers are sitting tight -- and may be for a while.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Less than 20% equity</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, 45% of home-loan borrowers have less than 20% equity in their homes, <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> says. Sellers would generally need at least 20% equity to generate enough cash to turn around and buy a similar or larger home using a conventional loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If people owe 25% or more on homes than they're worth, they may not be right-side-up again for a decade, says Sam Khater, <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supplies are shortest in markets where more homeowners are underwater, <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It recently analyzed underwater borrowers and housing supplies in the nation's 50 largest metropolitan areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In those where more than half of the home-loan borrowers were underwater, the supply averaged 4.7 months in March. In markets with less than 10% of underwater borrowers, supplies averaged 8.3 months, <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Over time, (home) prices will increase and lift people out of debt," Khater says. "But the scale of this is too large for anything but time to cure."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is the time right?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rob Oyler, 42, a fiber optics executive in a suburb of Kansas City, Mo., is pondering whether time is on his side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and his wife, Leigh Ann, have owned their home for 10 years. They're considering selling so they can buy a bigger home for the family of five.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest rates, which last week averaged 3.66% for a 30-year fixed-rate loan, have enticed them to think about leaving a beloved home and neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But they haven't taken the plunge. They suspect they'd get $20,000 less for their home than they put into it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We'd hate to take a loss on this house unless I know I'm getting a deal on a bigger one," Oyler says. "At the same time, interest rates have nowhere to go but up, and I worry that, if we don't sell, I'll be kicking myself in five years."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the Oylers and Andersens have equity in their homes, Eric Berto does not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and his wife, Kelci, bought their home in Kent, Wash., almost four years ago. They thought they'd bought at the bottom of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We were seriously wrong," says Berto, 31, who works in public relations. The couple estimate they could get $250,000 for the home they bought for $100,000 more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Berto is pursuing a lower interest rate loan so they can turn the house into a cash-flow-positive rental and still buy another home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Right now, we're operating under the assumption that the house will never again be worth $350,000," Berto says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dwindling inventories aren't confined to once-red-hot markets that took the biggest price declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Minneapolis, inventories of available homes are down to a 4.5- month supply, says Barb Jandric, president of Edina Realty, the largest brokerage firm in the Twin Cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike and Annie Resop tested the market in January, putting their 2,500-square-foot suburban Minneapolis home on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They listed it at the "high end," $269,000, Mike Resop, 31, says. They purchased it in 2008 for $250,000. No offers came. They considered lowering the price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Annie, an administrative assistant, and Mike, a truck driver, made a list of the pros and cons of selling. They'd leave a great neighborhood and good friends. But they'd buy a place with more land and a nicer backyard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They decided not to sell. The couple have since made closer friends in the neighborhood. Instead of being excited about someplace new, they're excited to improve their home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're happy to stay put," Resop says.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Home sales slide slightly in May</span>
</div><div class="author">Julie Schmit   </div><div>Julie Schmit, USA TODAY</div>
<div>394 words</div><div>22 June 2012</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>First</div><div>B.1</div><div>English</div><div>© 2012 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home sales slipped in May as tight supplies hampered the market amid growing economic headwinds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales slipped 1.5% in May from April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.55 million, but were still almost 10% above last year's pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The "slight pullback" in sales of existing homes is largely due to broad-based shortages of lower-price homes for sale rather than softening demand, says Lawrence Yun, National Association of Realtors chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Normally, more sellers put homes on the market in the spring, a big buying season. That didn't happen this year, Yun says, given the huge number of people who owe more on their homes than they're worth, and still-declining prices in many areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR says shortages of lower-price homes are evident in much of the country except the Northeast and that supplies are tight in all but upper-end markets in the West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tight supplies are helping home prices. NAR data show median home prices in May up almost 8% from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But NAR data don't account for the mix of homes sold. The share of more expensive homes has risen, while the share of distressed homes has fallen. That drives median prices higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other data sources that adjust for the mix of homes sold also show prices improving. The <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> said Thursday that U.S house prices were up 0.8% in April from March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As prices rise, more sellers will likely list homes for sale, says Zillow chief economist Stan Humphries. That would expand supply but could also depress prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">May's decline in the pace of existing home sales was not surprising, given the recent slowdown in job creation, and serves as a reminder that housing demand remains "mired in a tug of war" between sluggish job and credit growth and improved housing affordability, says Alistair Bentley, an economist with TD Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other economic news Thursday unnerved stock markets. One report showed China's manufacturing activity fell this month, and the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia</span> said manufacturing in its region shrank at the fastest pace since August. Jobless claims were little changed from last week, indicating a weak job market in danger of stalling.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">RENTING HOMES: The new American Dream? ; The housing crash fallout is changing neighborhoods and remaking the U.S. real estate market</span>
</div><div class="author">Julie Schmit </div><div>Julie Schmit, USA TODAY</div>
<div>1734 words</div><div>6 June 2012</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>A.1</div><div>English</div><div>© 2012 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steve and Jodi Jacobson bought their Phoenix-area "dream home" in 2005. They built flagstone steps to the front door. They tiled the kitchen and bathroom. They entertained often, enjoying their mountain views.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We put our soul into that house," says Steve Jacobson, 37.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, home prices tanked more than 50%. Steve, a software quality assurance engineer, suffered pay cuts. In 2010, foreclosure claimed the home and their $100,000 down payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Jacobsons didn't lose their desire to live in a single- family home, however. They now rent one, like many other former homeowners displaced by foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike traditional apartment renters, these new American tenants are older and have kids, U.S. Census Bureau data indicate. As they move from homes they owned to ones they rent, they're changing neighborhoods for better and for worse. They're fueling a land rush as investors snap up homes, mostly in markets hard-hit by foreclosure, to rent to them. And their growth -- in cities from Florida to California -- has implications for home builders, school districts and companies that will jockey for the dollars they used to invest in homes, Wall Street analysts and demographic researchers predict.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've never seen anything like this," says John Burns, CEO of John Burns Real Estate Consulting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The foreclosure crisis will drive 3 million former homeowners to rent single-family homes between 2010 and 2015, Burns estimates. Single-family home rental was the fastest-growing part of the rental market from 2005 to 2010, <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> says, citing U.S. Census data. Its continued growth is "unprecedented," Burns adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In the next five to 10 years, you'll see tens of billions, if not hundreds of billions, of dollars of private equity" pouring into the single-family rental business, says Justin Chang, principal of investment firm Colony Capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past six months, Colony has bought more than 1,000 homes to turn into rentals. Most are in Arizona, California and Nevada, though Colony expects to expand into Texas, Georgia and Florida. In the next year, it will invest at least $1.5 billion in single- family rentals, Chang says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new tenants are "a family, two kids, a dog and a fish bowl," says Gregor Watson, managing director of 643 Capital Management, which has 400 single-family rentals, most in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Jacobsons' neighborhood of 484 homes -- The Arbors in Gilbert -- typifies the trend. About 38% of the homes appear to be rentals. That's twice the percentage of the entire 3,900-home Power Ranch subdivision, says Stephanie Fee, manager of the Power Ranch Community Association. She says the number of rentals in The Arbors has grown. "The neighborhood has kind of turned," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes in The Arbors -- mostly two-story stuccos spaced a few feet apart -- were built less than a decade ago. Some were initially purchased as rentals, but most attracted first-time buyers, Fee says. Their values climbed with the housing bubble, then fell when it popped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2008, eight of 40 homes on the Jacobsons' street went through foreclosure, according to data from ForeclosureRadar. Public records indicate four appear to be rentals, because property tax bills go to different addresses. Other nearby homes have also become rentals in recent years, homeowners say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A neighborhood's evolution</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These used to be all owner-occupied," says Daniel Vandenberg, 28, an environmental consultant who bought his house in 2007 and lives on the same street as the Jacobsons. Most houses near him are now rentals, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vandenberg says the street "still looks nice" and is in better shape than a few years ago when more homes were vacant. The homeowners' association maintains much of the neighborhood, including its parks, community pools, lakes and playgrounds. Trash bins can't be out for more than 24 hours. Cars can't be parked on streets overnight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, the combination of rentals and declining home values has taken a toll on The Arbors' appearance, other homeowners say. On a recent Friday night, a home that neighbors said was a rental sat vacant. Its garage door hung crooked and part-way open.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You see fewer people taking care of yards, more parked cars, more people working on cars," says Arbors homeowner Michael Grandy, 35. He moved into the neighborhood in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michelle House, who bought her Arbors home in 2009 for $163,000, says she's now surrounded by rentals and people she no longer knows. She picks weeds left in yards. While the community is still "nice," it's not the owner-occupied neighborhood she thought she'd bought into. She also worries that rentals will harm home values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some cities have recently taken steps to limit the spread of rentals, fearing the same thing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city of West St. Paul, Minn., recently adopted a law limiting single-family home rentals to 10% of homes on a block. If blocks already had more than that, they were grandfathered in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Neighbors were complaining the homes weren't kept up," says Jim Hartshorn, community development director of West St. Paul, population 19,800. He says the city was hard-hit with foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mankato and Northfield, Minn., also passed block rental limits in recent years. Another Minnesota college town, Winona, did so in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Minnesota limits are at the "leading edge" of efforts that could grow, given the foreclosure crisis, says Anthony Sanders of the Institute for Justice, a non-profit public-interest law firm. It's representing Winona homeowners in a lawsuit against the limits. "There's just a fundamental right to be able to rent out your property," Sanders says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even some home builders are wary about too many rentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blandford Homes in Power Ranch recently stopped selling to investors, given ample demand from regular homeowners, says Blandford sales manager Jerry Lilly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You just don't want a neighborhood full of rentals," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Preliminary data from a study of home values in the late 1980s and early 1990s show that they decline slightly as rentals increase, says Edward Coulson, a Penn State University economist who is doing the independent study. A decade ago, he did a similar study, paid for by the Fannie Mae Foundation. It found that a 10% increase in a neighborhood's ownership rate led to an approximate 3.6% rise in home values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some cases, investor-owned rentals could help neighborhoods, says Paul Willen, a senior economist in the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of Boston</span>. In lower-income areas, for example, such owners might have more money to maintain homes than other owners can.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He says the growth of big-time investors in the single-family rental market is a "transitory thing" because it's more expensive to manage them than multi-family housing. "The end game for investors is to sell these homes profitably in three to five years to owners," Willen says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A temporary state</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Burns expects that 70% of those who lose homes to mortgage distress will own again. A recent <span class="companylink">Harris Interactive</span> survey, commissioned by Coldwell Banker, found that 83% of renters want to own a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, the growth of single-family home rentals will reverberate through communities and the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rentals can mean shifting student populations that present more challenges for schools, says Roger Freeman, superintendent of the Littleton Elementary School District in Avondale, Ariz., in the Phoenix region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Half of his district's 5,000 students are new this year, a far higher percentage than normal. Foreclosures are part of the reason, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Everything slows down," when new students enter a classroom, Freeman says. Parents are less likely to be involved in schools if they're not sure they'll be there for long, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move toward a "rentership society" is bad for home builders, says a report from <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>, but it's good for home furnishing retailers. People buy furnishings when they move, whether they rent or buy, the report says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More renters will present opportunities for other companies, says a study from the Demand Institute, which studies consumers. Without mortgages to pay, they may have more money to invest. That will affect financial-services firms, the study says. Tenants may need to rent storage space, should their rental homes be smaller than those they owned. Home improvement retailers will benefit as investor-owners repair homes to rent, the study adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new tenants in The Arbors have already changed their spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jessica and Mark Pierce started renting there 28 months ago. They lost their $550,000 home, 11 miles away, in a short sale in 2009 after a job loss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home sat on a quarter-acre lot. It was an "oasis with 18 palms," says Jessica Pierce, 37, a career consultant. The couple enjoyed dinner parties with neighbors. "Our kids knew each other," Pierce says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, they rent a smaller home. Their neighbors, whom Pierce doesn't know by name, can peer into her backyard. From her kitchen table, Pierce points out broken floor tile. She hasn't been inspired to get the landlord to fix it. The couple don't spend money on plants, new carpet, fresh paint, new tile -- as they would if they owned, Pierce says. They're also socking away money for a down payment and counting the days until they can own a home again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I just feel like I'm in someone else's home," Pierce says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Jacobsons aren't so wistful about homeownership. For 19 months, they've rented. Their home is neat, their furnishings are fashionable. Yet, their backyard is dirt and weeds, just as it was when they moved in. They keep the shades drawn. Instead of paying $2,100 a month to own, they pay $1,243.38 to rent. Instead of spending weekends fixing up their home, occasionally, they go to a jazz club.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I guess that was fun," says Jodi Jacobson, 38, recalling weekends at their former home. "But do we have any vacation memories from that time? No."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If they buy a home again, it'll be smaller, they say. "I would never put so much of my income again into a house," Steve Jacobson says.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Multiple offers and bidding wars have returned to some housing markets amid shrinking supplies of homes for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dwindling inventories -- driven by a mix of reluctant sellers, fewer foreclosure resales and rising demand -- are spreading as the housing market gains strength.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes for sale in April hit a 6.6-month supply, down from 9.1 months a year ago, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> says. A six-month supply is considered a healthy market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some markets have fallen below that. Last month, nine of 18 leading markets tracked by real estate brokerage Redfin had less than a three-month supply. That means it would have taken three months to sell all of the listed homes at April's sales pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those markets included the San Francisco Bay Area, Phoenix, Denver and Washington, D.C. A year ago, only Phoenix had such a low inventory, Redfin's data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Multiple offers are definitely the norm," says Rick Turley, president of <span class="companylink">Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage</span> for the San Francisco Bay Area. At one point this month, 80% of the properties that his agents were working to buy or sell had multiple offers, Turley says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike the days during the housing bubble, house shoppers are more likely to go to the sidelines after making three or four offers, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're seeing a significant number of people step back from multiple bids," says Glenn Kelman, Redfin CEO. "They say, 'I'm not going to make the mistake people made in 2006.'"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with a year ago, supplies are tighter in every price category in 47 of 50 top U.S. markets, according to real estate website Zillow. Leaner supplies of lower-price homes are especially evident in some markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Phoenix, San Francisco and Las Vegas, the number of lower- price homes for sale has dropped 64%, 53% and 50%, respectively, in the past year, Zillow's analysis found. That's a bigger drop than what's occurred for higher-price homes in those markets, Zillow's data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tight inventories will push up prices, encouraging more people to list homes, Zillow economist Stan Humphries says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plenty are waiting. "Every Realtor knows divorced couples living in the same house because they're waiting for higher prices," says Remax Realtor Kathie Shandro in Denver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many people lack enough home equity to buy again, <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> economist Mark Fleming says. <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> says 45% of mortgage holders have less than 20% home equity.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales rose last month, offering further evidence that the U.S. housing market is on track for a slow and bumpy recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April, existing home sales were up 3.4% from March to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.6 million, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> reported Tuesday. They rose 10% from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales were higher in all four U.S. regions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NAR data show distressed sales were 28% of April's total, down from 37% a year ago. Fewer distressed home sales, which include foreclosures and short sales, helps values. Distressed homes sold at 14% to 21% discounts in April vs. non-distressed sales, the NAR says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory of homes for sale has also shrunk year-over-year. Nationwide, the number of homes listed for sale in April was down 21% from a year ago, the NAR says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, demand is up, given job growth and a strengthening economy, says Jed Kolko, economist for real estate website Trulia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's more buyers, but they're chasing fewer homes on the market," Kolko says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some areas of the country, the inventory of homes for sale is particularly tight, including: Washington, D.C.; Miami and Naples, Fla.; Phoenix; Orange County, Calif.; and Seattle, the NAR says. Most are likely to see stronger price increases, it says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of those markets have seen inventories shrink more than the national average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Southern California had 41% fewer homes for sale in April than a year ago, says Steven Thomas, who tracks the market for ReportsOnHousing.com. "Multiple offers are now the norm," he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors and foreign buyers have helped reduce Phoenix's housing inventory to its lowest level in more than six years, says John Burns Real Estate Consulting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Multiple offers are also the norm for homes in the east side of Seattle, including Bellevue, Wash., says Coldwell Banker Bain Realtor Anthony Gilbert. Competition has heated up so fast that some buyers have been surprised, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, he had a client who was shocked to find out that her offer was one of six on a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the market continues to improve, Gilbert expects more sellers to put homes on the market. Now, many sellers are waiting for better prices, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trulia data show that homes listed for sale in February through April averaged 6.2% larger this year than last, suggesting higher- price homes may be making up more of the market.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nation has fewer homes for sale, and that's helping prices in markets where low supplies are meeting strong demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. had 2.37 million existing homes for sale at the end of March. That was down 22% from a year ago and 41% from the peak in mid-2007, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> reported Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-quarter home sales, meanwhile, were up 5.3% from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The combination of improving sales -- coming off one of the worst years ever for home sales -- and declining inventories is helping prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NAR says median existing single-family home prices rose in 74 of 146 U.S. markets in the first quarter, while they fell in 72 areas. In last year's fourth quarter, 29 markets showed gains from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Given the steadily dwindling supply of inventory and notably higher listing prices prices are expected to show further improvements," says Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At current levels, the housing inventory is at a more "normal" level, says <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> economist Sam Khater. If home prices aren't already at the bottom, "We're not far away," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home price data from <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> and Zillow both show prices up slightly in March from February. Meanwhile, Fiserv Case-Shiller predicts home prices will stabilize this summer and post a 0.8% drop for the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As prices rise, after six years of declines, sellers who have kept homes off the market will increasingly put them on, says Jed Kolko, Trulia economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"But buyers will come out, too," says Stan Humphries, Zillow economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The broad trend is for home sales to be 5% to 10% above last year, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some markets are already seeing tight supplies, leading to price gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Phoenix, the supply of homes for sale in March was down 64% from a year earlier, says Michael Orr, real estate expert at <span class="companylink">Arizona State University</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home inventories in Phoenix peaked in late 2010 and began to fall. Now, prices for homes under $500,000 are rising and "there's no sign of it stopping, because supplies are so tight," Orr says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yun says NAR has noticed "broad shortages of lower-priced homes," most notably in Phoenix; suburban Washington, D.C.; Orange County, Calif.; Naples, Fla.; Seattle; and North Dakota.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreclosures may rise following the recent $25 billion foreclosure settlement between mortgage servicers and federal and state officials. But the number of foreclosed homes for sale isn't likely to swamp markets due to increased efforts to modify home loans or allow short sales, Khater says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average U.S. home prices -- down by a third since 2006 and still falling -- will rise almost 4% a year for the next five years, according to a new forecast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Market watcher Fiserv sees prices stabilizing by summer's end and then climbing, quickly in some places until gains taper off. The forecast is based on an analysis of leading home price indexes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors will drive much of the momentum, as they are now in cities such as Las Vegas and Phoenix.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time and trade-up buyers will eventually follow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the time home prices stop falling, they'll be almost 35% below their 2006 peak, Fiserv says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, market researcher <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> said Tuesday that U.S. home prices rose 0.6% in March from February, the first month-over- month increase since July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Good affordability and declining inventories are key factors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conventional mortgage payments now account for just 12% of median family incomes vs. a historical norm of 20%, says Fiserv economist David Stiff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fiserv forecast, done with <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics, assumes steady economic growth with no major shocks. Markets hardest hit by foreclosures will show the biggest five-year increases in home appreciation, it adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Six of the 10 markets where annualized prices are expected to rise most over the next five years had price drops of more than 50% from their peaks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Las Vegas, for instance, is 61% off its 2006 peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Realtor.com says Florida has more cities than any other state that show the strongest signs of a housing recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each quarter, the real estate website assesses housing data, including changes in list prices, inventories of homes for sale and local economies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phoenix, Miami and Orlando are the top turnaround cities in its study, based on those markets' improvements in the first quarter compared with a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asking prices are up more than 20% in Phoenix and Miami, says Realtor.com. Inventories are down more than 40%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Naples, Fla., and Boise are also climbing in the rankings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New to the list of top 25 markets are Oakland and San Jose, which are benefiting from growth in the tech industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The continued performance of local markets will depend a lot on the economy as well as on how quickly lenders dispose of distressed homes, says Realtor.com CEO Steve Berkowitz.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Realtor.com is owned by Move, which operates a network of real estate websites.</p>

</div><div class="author">Wendy Koch   </div><div>Wendy Koch, USA TODAY</div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everyone's heard the horror stories -- the contractor who rips out the back of a house, has a nervous breakdown and disappears, one day before the homeowner leaves town for vacation. Or the builder who never shows up on time, does poor work and overcharges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home renovations, expected to pick up later this year, don't have to be traumatic. With a bit of luck, and lots of preparation, homeowners can boost the odds for a happy ending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're working on the heart of a person's life. We're house doctors. Choose your doctor carefully," says Jerry Levine, a Washington, D.C.-area remodeler with the Levine Group. He says remodeling is sensitive business, because it forces occupants to think about their lives together and to make myriad decisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I've seen marriages fall apart," Levine says, adding that contractors often act as much as therapists as builders. When a couple start arguing about whether they want stripes on the wallpaper, he says they may really be talking about whether to stay in the marriage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a very personal relationship (between customer and contractor). You have to like the person," says designer Stephen Saint-Onge, author of No Place Like Home (Wiley), encouraging people to get referrals from friends and neighbors. "You don't want to have someone in your house you'll dread seeing every day."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those encounters are likely to be more common, given the industry's projected growth by the Remodeling Futures Program at Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies. In a mid- April report, the program said stronger home sales and low interest rates will boost remodeling later this year, ending 2012 up 5.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With homeowners crushed for time, the selection process often becomes a sort of speed dating, and contractors say they're often asked the wrong initial questions:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How long will it take? How much will it cost? When can you start?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People are too focused on getting it done and the price," says George "Geep" Moore Jr., a remodeler from Elm Grove, La., and the 2012 Remodeling Chairman for the National Association of Home Builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The cheapest price is not always the best price," he says, noting some contractors may underbid to get a job, then tack on higher fees later, do poor work or possibly not finish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He recommends homeowners learn more instead about the contractor's qualifications, licensing and insurance by asking for proof of each and verifying the information with licensing boards and insurers. Unless the insurance covers workers' compensation, he says, a customer can be liable if a workman gets hurt on the job, and many homeowners' policies don't cover those expenses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The right questions are especially important in older homes because of new federal rules for handling lead-based paint. In 2010, the Environmental Protection Agency began requiring that contractors who work on pre-1978 homes be certified in lead-safe practices or face daily fines of up to $37,500. Not all remodelers have been certified, and homeowners may unknowingly hire less expensive, untrained workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of 129 million U.S. housing units, 76.5 million were built before 1980 and half of those -- about 38 million -- contain lead, according to the EPA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Always call and get references," Moore says, adding it's wise to check on the contractor's record with the Better Business Bureau, as well as with local builders' associations. And he adds: "Don't ever do a job without a contract."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I would interview three people" when hiring either a contractor or an architect, says architect Sarah Susanka, co-author of Not So Big Remodeling (<span class="companylink">Taunton Press</span>). "I wouldn't go much more than that, because you'll drive yourself crazy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Susan Matus, a project designer for Case Design/Remodeling, a large Washington, D.C.-area firm, says homeowners often benefit by picking a contractor who also offers design services. That way, she says, the project is designed to meet the client's budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You don't want to go through the design process and find you're off track" financially, she says, referring to cases where an architect designs something that the client can't afford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When hired separately, however, architects can represent the owners' interests in checking the work of contractors -- up to a point. Who checks the architects? In some large projects, homeowners hire an independent third party to make sure everyone is doing his or her job correctly. Usually, though, that falls to the homeowner. That's why homeowners are advised to take the time to hire qualified people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Direct experience is the No. 1 priority. Have they really done this kind of project before?" says Duo Dickinson, an architect and author of Staying Put: Remodel Your House to Get the Home You Want (<span class="companylink">Taunton Press</span>).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He adds: "The one thing you have to do is not hire a brother-in- law."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">---</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What to ask before hiring a contractor</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of the Remodeling Industry suggests homeowners ask these questions to pick a contractor (the same approach works for architects):</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How long have you been in business? Are you licensed to do this kind of job? Make sure the level of license is right for your job, and that the license is current.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Who will be working on the project -- employees or subcontractors? Do you do background checks on these workers?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do you carry workers' compensation and liability insurance? Check with the insurance company to verify the policy is current.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How many projects like mine have you completed in the past year? May I have a list of references from them? Check with the Better Business Bureau and the local or state consumer affairs office for any complaints.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Have you or your employees been certified in remodeling or had any special training or education? Lead-abatement certification is now required for remodelers working on most homes built before 1978.</p>

</div><div class="author">Julie Schmit   </div><div>Julie Schmit, USA TODAY</div>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage loan rates are touching new 60-year lows, but many consumers won't be able to take advantage of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lower rates will likely spur some homeowners to refinance, economists say. But mortgage standards remain so tight that many people won't qualify for a loan if they want to buy a house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Disappointing economic growth helped drive fixed 30-year mortgages down to an average of 3.84% this week, says mortgage giant <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. That bested the previous record low of 3.87% in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low rates are traditionally good for housing demand, but this time may be different. Rates are dropping on signs of slowing economic growth, which isn't good for consumer confidence or housing demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We should not be excited about lower rates for home purchases," says Jed Kolko, economist for housing website Trulia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has been showing signs of improvement. Existing home sales were up 5.2% in March from a year ago, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Declines in home prices are smaller, and there are signs of bottoming in some markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strong demand and tighter inventories sparked a nearly 2% rise in asking prices on homes for sale February through April, compared with the prior three months, new Trulia data shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After adjustment for seasonal factors, 92 of the USA's 100 largest metro areas showed increases, Trulia says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for home loans is also up. The latest data from the Mortgage Bankers Association shows applications for home purchases on the upswing for the week ended April 27.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That shows people who need mortgages are beginning to add to improving home sales, says economist Paul Diggle of Capital Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers shouldn't hold out for lower rates, says Guy Cecala of Inside Mortgage Finance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're near the lowest you'll ever see," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the latest drop, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> still expects 30-year-fixed- rate loans to rise later this year to 4.25% or even 4.5%, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> economist Frank Nothaft says.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Where's the recovery going? ; Slower? Steady? Faster? Washington may decide</span>
</div><div class="author">Tim Mullaney   </div><div>Tim Mullaney, USA TODAY</div>
<div>1791 words</div><div>25 April 2012</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.1</div><div>English</div><div>© 2012 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists may have finally learned CEOs' first rule of dealing with Wall Street: It's better to underpromise and overdeliver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the past two years, forecasters have overpromised, as bullish predictions for 2010 and 2011 fell short. Last year's hoped-for recovery soon faded in the fallout from Japan's earthquake, coupled with Washington's flirtation with defaulting on the national debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Heading into this year, economists all but unanimously predicted a first-half slowdown that would keep unemployment near 8.5% through the election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fortunately, so far this year they've been wrong again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke will discuss the Fed's outlook today after the Fed's policymaking body ends its two-day meeting. On Friday, the government is preparing to report first-quarter growth, which is expected to beat most economists' estimates from three months ago -- maybe as high as 3%, says Diane Swonk of <span class="companylink">Mesirow Financial</span>, who had predicted only 1.9%. Joblessness is at 8.2%, and USA TODAY's 50-member panel of economists forecasts it will reach 8% by year's end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the recovery finally puts down what appear to be stronger roots, it faces one big force that could strengthen and reinforce it -- and an even bigger one that threatens to derail it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coming down the track from one direction is the bullish force of pent-up demand -- especially the potential buying power of households that haven't been formed since 2008 as the recession and its aftermath forced young people to double up, not move out of relatives' homes or not get married.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the other direction is another Washington-induced showdown: a locomotive of expiring tax cuts and spending reductions set to take effect Dec. 31 that forecasters think could shave 3.5% off the economy next year -- in essence, negating all of its 2012 growth and then some -- if the election doesn't produce a clear direction for fiscal policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People don't realize the U.S. was the only major economy in the world that improved last year," said Richard Bernstein, head of money manager Richard Bernstein Advisors in New York. "It's not strong, but it certainly has improved. As we progress through this year, the fiscal cliff will be a major issue -- for (financial) markets all over the world."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Running off that fiscal cliff would add more pain to what has been the most painful recession and protracted recovery in most Americans' lifetimes. The 2.5% growth economists predict for this year is nothing special but better than last year's 1.7%. The economy grew 7.2% in 1984, coming out of the next-deepest postwar downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deep wounds, long recovery</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recession was deep, and the recovery long, for the same reason, Fed Governor Sarah Raskin said in an April 12 speech. Americans got in over their heads on housing, then saw $7 trillion of home equity and 8.8 million jobs wiped out by the housing bust and its aftermath. Consumers have also been slow to resume spending because they have so much debt left over from the housing bubble, said Carmen Reinhart, co-author of This Time Is Different, a 2009 book that argues recoveries from downturns caused by financial panics are always protracted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While consumers' debt payments have come down because of lower interest rates, their debt loads are twice as large as after the 1982 recession, Reinhart said. The result: Even with 4.1 million new private-sector jobs added since February 2010, the U.S. is still 5.2 million total jobs below January 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that effect is slowly wearing off. With a boost from rapid retirements among Baby Boomers, the unemployment rate has dropped nearly 2 percentage points in two years. Two different surveys Tuesday reported modest gains in housing prices, and first-quarter new home sales were up more than 10%, helped by better credit quality among more-recent mortgages and a slow unwinding of the stock of foreclosed homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Growth is 2.5%, rock-solid," said Mark Zandi, <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics' chief economist, reflecting the consensus of USA TODAY's panel of economists, whose median 2012 growth estimate is 2.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Job growth is 175,000-200,000 a month, pretty much rock-solid. We were at 250,000 a month, but some of that was the warm winter, and March (when the economy added 120,000 jobs) was a kind of payback," Zandi said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> is still worried enough to keep monetary policy very loose. It has committed to keeping interest rates "extremely low" through late 2014, even though more than 80% of USA TODAY's economists now expect the Fed to raise rates sooner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street is also campaigning for the Fed to do more bond- buying operations, known as quantitative easing, in which the central bank pumps money into the economy by buying U.S. Treasuries and other government-backed bonds. Some on Wall Street, including Goldman Sachs Asset Management Chairman Jim O'Neill, have worried that the recent uptick in new claims for unemployment insurance may herald a new slowdown in growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The last two weeks have not been great for those thinking of GDP growth surprising significantly" for the better, O'Neill wrote on Monday. "We need to take each stage of evidence as it comes."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the forces that have prompted recent worries are fading, however:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The eurozone's financial woes are a long way from over, but the crisis has calmed some since the European Central Bank created a 500 billion euro ($658 billion) lending program to prop up continental banks in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase in the price of gasoline that sparked renewed recession fears in the U.S. this winter is abating. Gas prices have fallen 7 cents a gallon in the last two weeks, to $3.87 a gallon for regular, and are now slightly below this time last year, the Energy Department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers' debt payments as a percentage of their income are at their lowest levels since 1994, according to the Fed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That sets the stage for consumer confidence, and especially new household formation, to take the recovery up a notch by next year, Zandi argues. Household formation fell to 357,000 in the year ended in March 2010, where 1.2 million is normal, he said. He estimates the car market has 2 million units in pent-up demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You have a lot of twentysomethings who have been doubled up with their parents because they couldn't find a job," Zandi said. Coupled with people who have put off buying cars or houses because of the economy, household formations should help push up vehicle demand by another million units a year, to 15.5 million, he said. At the same time, home building could double from last year's record low as the market works off the backlog of foreclosed and vacant homes. Both should be underway by late 2013 or 2014, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Car sales have already picked up. Washington, D.C.-area dealer <span class="companylink">Darcars Automotive Group</span> posted a 14% sales gain in the first quarter, Vice President Tammy Darvish said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're back to worrying about growing our facilities," said Darvish, whose $100-million-a-year company has more than $10 million in capital improvements underway. "A lot of it has to do with the age of cars on the road, and the biggest accelerant has been better availability of credit."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Headed for a cliff?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big question is whether the other train coming down the track is even more powerful -- and what Washington should do about it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two major economics consulting firms, <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> and IHS Global Insight, have said the nation could lose substantially all of its short-term economic momentum after the election if potential tax increases and budget cuts go into effect simultaneously.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each put the potential impact of allowing the 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts to expire, sunsetting the 2010 payroll tax cut that was extended to last through this year, and letting $900 billion in automatic spending cuts over 10 years take effect as scheduled, at 3.5% of gross domestic product. That's worth about $550 billion, based on last year's GDP of $15.1 trillion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither party so far has proposed anything as drastic as rushing headlong off what Bernanke has called the "massive fiscal cliff" waiting at the end of the year. President Obama has proposed raising taxes on incomes above $250,000 for couples and $200,000 for single taxpayers. Mitt Romney, the likely Republican presidential nominee, has proposed a 20% income tax cut across the board. Both have proposed cutting corporate tax rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But unless Congress can forge a deal by Dec. 31, all the tax cuts will expire and spending reductions will take effect in January. That has economists on the left and right musing about alternatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congress could cut the deficit and protect the economy by phasing out Bush's tax cuts for the top two brackets, covering joint filers with incomes above $212,300, instead of just the top bracket, said Jared Bernstein, a former top aide to Vice President Biden who works at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He would also phase out tax cuts for middle-income consumers as the economy improves, until most people pay the tax rates they did under President Clinton. Bernstein would suspend most of last summer's spending cuts in exchange for phasing out extended unemployment benefits and the payroll tax cut as unemployment falls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A small number of GOP-leaning economists are also calling for the party to compromise some, and to tone down their rhetoric on the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A lot of conservatives have been way too negative on the economy," said Brian Wesbury, chief economist at asset manager First Trust in Chicago, and a former chief economist for the congressional Joint Economic Committee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The likeliest outcome is for the post-election Congress to split the difference, extending some tax cuts and not following through immediately on all the planned spending cuts, Zandi said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That strategy could produce 3% growth next year and 4% in 2014, he said. Unemployment might fall to about 7% by the end of 2013, he added -- the lowest since November 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But until Congress and the president make a deal, economists and market analysts don't rule out another drama like last year's debt- ceiling showdown, which helped stall the economy and slice 20% off the stock market.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices continue to fall but there are small signs of improvement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, prices fell 0.8% in February, the sixth-consecutive month of price declines, according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case Shiller index released Tuesday. When adjusted for seasonal factors, prices rose 0.2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> index shows home prices rising 0.4% for the 12 months ended in February, the first 12- month increase since July 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Home prices are slowly bottoming out," says Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist of Mizuho Securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller index shows February's prices were 35% below their 2006 peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">March numbers appear to be stronger, says Stan Humphries, chief economist of Zillow. A report it's releasing today shows home prices rising 0.5% from February to March, the largest monthly increase in almost six years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nineteen of the 30 markets covered by the Zillow forecast will bottom in 2012, or already have, Zillow forecasts. Nationally, home prices will fall 0.4% in the next 12 months and may bottom in late 2012, Zillow adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Markets will hit bottom at different times, economists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The FHFA index, which includes fewer distressed homes than the Case-Shiller data do, shows prices are holding up better in markets with fewer distressed homes, says Patrick Newport, IHS Global Insight economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices are picking up in some markets especially hard hit by the foreclosure crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They have risen for five months in Phoenix, including a 1.2% gain in February, Case-Shiller data show. Miami posted a 0.6% monthly increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zillow forecasts Phoenix will see a 6.5% gain in the next 12 months, the nation's best home price appreciation rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strong demand from investors and increasing demand from regular buyers -- coupled with a low supply -- is driving prices in Phoenix, says Michael Orr, real estate expert at <span class="companylink">Arizona State University</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Miami will follow Phoenix, with a 5.6% gain in the next year, Zillow says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phoenix and Miami both suffered huge price declines but are attractive to second-home buyers and investors, Humphries says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atlanta, whose market lacks those strengths and has been hurt by high foreclosures, posted a 17% drop in prices in February from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was far worse than the 3.5% decline in Case-Shiller's index of 20 leading cities.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's great wall of cash is pouring into the struggling U.S. property market, from multimillion-dollar mansions on the West Coast to venerable hotels on the East Coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers from mainland China and Hong Kong are snapping up luxury homes, often paying cash, in major U.S. cities such as New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco. They're coming by the dozens to buy foreclosed properties in downtrodden cities in Florida and Nevada. Chinese buyers are even starting to snap up pricey commercial buildings and hotels in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese interest in U.S. real estate began climbing during the U.S. housing meltdown, when plunging property prices made the U.S. a magnet for global buyers. Today, interest is growing as a rising yuan -- up more than 8% since mid-2010 -- gives the Chinese greater purchasing power, and the mainland's restrictions on property purchases encourage them to look overseas. With U.S. single-family home prices a third lower since 2006, the U.S. also compares favorably with other top markets for Chinese investment, such as the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For China, the world is an emerging opportunity," says Andrew Taylor, founder of Juwai.com, a real estate site based in Hong Kong that was launched in 2011 to match Chinese buyers with U.S. real estate. "We're talking about a huge chunk of people with cash and the desire" to invest overseas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.S., the Chinese are now the second-largest foreign buyers of homes, behind Canadians, accounting for $7.4 billion of sales in the 12 months ended March 2011, up 24% from the previous 12 months, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. Buyers from China and Hong Kong also spent $1.7 billion on commercial property in the U.S. in 2011, more than quadruple their investment in 2008, says <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those numbers likely understate Chinese investment, as investors may buy property under business entities they've set up in the U.S., says Patrick O'Neill, founder of ONeill Group, a Hong Kong-based company that helps Chinese buyers find U.S. property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Roughly 40% of Chinese buyers want property in the U.S. as investments, while 60% are buying in anticipation of their children going to school here, or for business or immigration purposes, says Steven Lawson, chief executive of Windham China, a firm that helps match Chinese buyers with U.S. sellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lily-Sui Zhang, 30, says her husband's Beijing family bought a house in South Pasadena, Calif., last year so her three young children would have access to good public schools. The family thought investing in the U.S. was "probably more stable than in Beijing" due to concern about a Chinese real estate bubble, Zhang says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some Chinese buyers also see the U.S. as an attractive place to invest because on the mainland, Chinese never own land -- they just lease it from the government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While mainland China allows each citizen to exchange only $50,000 of yuan into foreign currency per year, wealthy clients often do business overseas and have offshore funds they can use to buy property, says Alan Liu, managing director of North Asia for Colliers International, a brokerage and real estate firm. The currency restriction doesn't apply in Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hong Kong residents Lillian and Frank Yan say they bought a condo in Honolulu this year because U.S. property prices are relatively low compared with major cities in Asia. They plan to stay there two to four weeks a year, and rent it out the rest of the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The majority of our equity is tied to the Hong Kong or Chinese economy, so we wanted to diversify our portfolio," says Lillian Yan, 42.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A multitude of millionaires</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China has more money to invest than ever. Mainland China now has 960,000 millionaires -- defined as individuals with residences, private businesses and investable assets of more than 10 million yuan or $1.5 million, according to the Hurun Report, a Shanghai publisher of magazines for China's wealthy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly half of those millionaires are considering moving or getting permission to reside overseas. Their top country of choice? The USA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the year ended Sept. 30, Chinese applicants accounted for 78% of the 3,805 EB-5 applications in the U.S., up from 35% four years before, according to government data. In that program, foreign investors can get permanent resident status, or "green cards," in exchange for investing $500,000 or $1million, depending on the part of the country, in ventures that create or sustain at least 10 jobs within two years of the immigrant investor's admission to the U.S. as a conditional permanent resident.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some lawmakers also see foreign investment as a way to boost the U.S. housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Legislation proposed last fall by Sens. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and Mike Lee, R-Utah, would let foreigners get a three-year resident visa if they invest $500,000 in U.S. real estate, including $250,000 for a primary home. They'd have to live at least 180 days a year in the property and pay taxes here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California dreamin'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco areas are most popular with Chinese home buyers, according to Realtors and data from real estate website Trulia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">East West Bank, a regional bank heavily active in California with branches in China and Hong Kong, says U.S. home buying among mainland Chinese has been "stable" in recent years as buyers wait for prices in various markets to hit bottom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They want to buy at the lowest" price, Senior Vice President Emily Wang says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the affluent Southern California city of San Marino -- where the median price of a home sold in January was $1.6 million, according to MDA <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span> -- Chinese buyers are looking for high- end homes in good school districts and neighborhoods likely to see stable home values, says Linda Chang of Coldwell Banker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of her recent mainland Chinese buyers paid $5 million for a 5,000-square-foot home in Pasadena that the family expects to occupy for one month a year, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They treat it like a hotel without room service," says Chang, who estimates that a quarter of shoppers in the $3 million-plus market in her area are from mainland China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mainland Chinese also account for a third of the buyers at luxury home builder <span class="companylink">Toll Bros</span>.' new home development, the Heritage in Vista Del Verde in Yorba Linda, Calif., southeast of downtown Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the San Francisco Bay Area, Realtor Stanley Lo of Green Banker real estate says mainland Chinese -- a third of his clientele -- are looking for homes priced at $800,000 and up. Most of his clients are Chinese business executives, who can afford second homes. They follow friends, relatives or work colleagues to the suburbs between San Francisco and the Silicon Valley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One recent rainy afternoon, Lo showed a six-bedroom $4.5 million Hillsborough home to Lee Xiao Jun, from Hubei Province in China. Her husband works in manufacturing and makes frequent trips between the U.S. and China, so they want a home in a good location close to the San Francisco airport.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The prices here are more reasonable than in China," she says, standing under wood-beamed ceilings overlooking a garden terrace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York City, mainland Chinese are increasingly paying cash for $20 million "trophy apartments," says Pamela Liebman, CEO of <span class="companylink">Corcoran Group</span>, a residential real estate brokerage company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based on current trends -- and the increasing numbers of mainland Chinese buyers -- Liebman expects they'll account for one in 10 uber- luxury buyers in the next year or two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York, New York</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York City is also popular with a growing number of Chinese investors looking for commercial property. Last year, China's <span class="companylink">HNA Group</span>, which owns <span class="companylink">Hainan Airlines</span>, paid $265 million for 1180 Avenue of the Americas, a 23-story office building in Manhattan, and $126 million for the luxury Cassa Hotel and Residences near bustling Times Square.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hong Kong billionaire Cheng Yu-tung's family also bought five U.S. luxury hotels in 2011, including Manhattan's iconic Carlyle, for $570 million. Chinese investors are looking to buy hotels as a growing number of mainlanders travel overseas, says Chris Brooke, chief executive of broker CBRE, Asia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, unlike the Japanese, who were criticized for overpaying for high-profile U.S. assets in the 1980s and 1990s, many Chinese investors "do not care about the image of a building and usually do not want to pay a premium for such image," says Allen Wu, chairman of Wu &amp; Kao law firm, which represents <span class="companylink">HNA Group</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rising numbers of Chinese investors are hard for U.S. developers and real estate agents to ignore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LA Urban Homes, which is selling a development of 125 new homes in Southern California's San Gabriel Valley, recently added a Chinese language section to its website to lure the mainland Chinese, says President Jeff Lee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corcoran is working with partners in China to bring potential buyers to New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, Corcoran brought one group of 11 Chinese buyers, four of whom bought properties. This year, it plans to do at least four such events, maybe six, Liebman says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Five years ago, developers were coming to me about opportunities to invest in China, and now, they're coming to me to try to get Chinese to invest" in the U.S., says Patrick Randolph, a professor of real estate law at the University of Missouri-Kansas City and a co-director of the Real Estate Research Center at Peking University in Beijing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zhuang Nuo, president of SouFun International, a Beijing real estate company that brings dozens of mainlanders to the U.S. each year to tour new and foreclosed properties, says he expects the U.S. to remain the top choice for clients buying overseas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The U.S. is always the Chinese people's dream," says Zhuang.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spring home-selling season could be the strongest in years and may foreshadow which markets will lead a battered housing industry in an anemic recovery, economists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This spring will be the litmus test for housing demand," says Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist for Mizuho Securities USA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spring season typically runs March through June but may have started early this year because of unseasonably warm weather.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While last year was dismal for existing home sales, this year is looking better. Existing home sales in February were up 9% from the same time a year ago, as was the Pending Home Sale index, which reflects signed contracts leading to sales, says the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Realtors' confidence in the single-family home market is the highest in four years, according to a late February NAR survey of 4,300 agents. Coldwell Banker says its website's traffic was up 47% in February from last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This spring season "will be the best in four or five years," says economist Paul Dales of Capital Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But not all markets will move together, and spring sales may signal which ones are improving or still declining, says Eric Fox, Veros Real Estate Solutions economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Veros forecasts that U.S. home prices overall will drop 0.85% in the next 11 months but that 40% of 321 metropolitan areas will see prices rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phoenix will do best, Veros says. Given a 42% drop in home supply and a relatively strong economy, Phoenix homes will see a 5% price gain this year, Veros says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A similar-size drop in supply is also helping Denver, says Scott Webber, president of Fuller <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>. "We've returned to a much more balanced market," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Denver prices rose 0.2% in January year-over-year, the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case-Shiller index shows. Of 20 cities, only Denver, Phoenix and Detroit posted annual gains, S&amp;P says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Webber says non-distressed homeowners still hesitate to sell, but others see a shift. In central Pennsylvania, Coldwell Banker saw a 30% jump in new listings in February over a year ago. March was strong, too, says manager Naomi Fredlund in Hershey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People were holding off," hoping for stronger prices, Fredlund says. "Now, they're selling." She expects flat prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spring sales could disappoint because a mild winter drew some buyers into the market earlier, Dales says. Also, investors bought a record 25.4% of homes in February, says a Campbell/Inside Mortgage Finance survey. They buy all year and may mute the impact of the spring season this year.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Home-price slide slows, so bottom may be near ; Especially true for homes that aren't foreclosures or short sales</span>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices are still dropping, but the pace is moderating and expectations are growing that the bottom is near.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices fell 0.8% in January from December, according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller 20-city index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">S&amp;P described the home sales market as off to a "rocky start" this year, but the decline was less than the 1.1% drop in December and the 1.3% decline in November. Year over year, January prices were off 3.8%, which is also a better showing than the 4.1% drop posted in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, home builder Lennar said Tuesday that first-quarter sales were the strongest in four years. New orders were up 33% year- over-year, enabling some price increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have seen the market stabilize," Lennar CEO Stuart Miller said in a statement. The strong results inspired investors, who bid up Lennar shares as well as those of other home builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other home price indexes also show signs that the long decline in prices may be near an end, especially for homes that aren't foreclosures or short sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices were unchanged from December to January, based on the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span>'s index. That includes fewer distressed homes than does the Case-Shiller index, says Patrick Newport, IHS Global Insight economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>, meanwhile, shows prices rising in January by 0.7% for homes not subject to short sale or foreclosure. When accounting for all homes, <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> says, prices were down 1% from December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices are "not far from the bottom," says <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> chief economist Mark Fleming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet slowing declines -- and even a bottoming -- are far from rising prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 6 million homeowners were either late on their mortgage payments or already in foreclosure at the end of last year, the Mortgage Bankers Association says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As many of those distressed homes eventually sell, they'll put further pressure on prices, says Stan Humphries, Zillow economist. He expects home sales to trend up this year while prices continue to fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newport also expects prices to drop more this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much will depend on consumer confidence and credit availability. Consumer confidence pulled back slightly in March after rising sharply in Feburary. But consumers don't feel the economy is losing momentum, says Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board Consumer Research Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the 20 cities in the Case-Shiller index, Atlanta continues to suffer the most. Prices there are down almost 20% over the last six months, S&amp;P says. Distressed home sales are probably driving those declines, economists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">S&amp;P reported year-over-year price gains for three cities: Denver, 0.2%; Detroit, 1.7%; and Phoenix, 1.3%.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">30-year home mortgage tops 4% ; Average rate rises, but still comparably low</span>
</div><div class="author">Julie Schmit   </div><div>Julie Schmit, USA TODAY</div>
<div>401 words</div><div>23 March 2012</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.1</div><div>English</div><div>© 2012 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage has topped 4% for the first time since late October, but the increase isn't expected to derail budding signs of strengthening in the U.S. housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage giant <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> said Thursday that the average rate on 30-year loans jumped to 4.08% this week, up from 3.88% two weeks ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates, which have been at or near record lows for months, are rising with higher yields on 10-year Treasury notes and the improving economy. They may go higher. <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> expects 30- year fixed-rate loans to be nearer to 4.25% to 4.5% by the end of the year, says Freddie Mac chief economist Frank Nothaft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher mortgage rates are historically bad news for housing, but their impact will be tempered by:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still super-low rates. Even with increases, mortgage rates are still "extraordinarily low," Nothaft says. From 1990 through 2010, mortgage rates averaged 7.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage affordability. Nationwide, home prices are nearly 34% below their 2006 peak. For mortgage affordability to return to the average level seen between 1990 and 2008, 30-year mortgage rates would need to rise to 9%, Capital Economics says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With home prices still falling in many markets, the latest mortgage rate increases "won't put the brakes on the recovery," says Paul Dales of Capital Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other economic concerns. With unemployment still high at 8.3% and lending standards still tight, borrowers' outlook on the economy is likely to influence housing demand more than slightly rising mortgage rates, says David Crowe, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of dampening demand, rising rates may "get a few people off the fence" and into buying, Crowe says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's more likely for people who are considering refinancing, says Jed Kolko, Trulia economist. He says rising rates "might slow the (housing market's) momentum slightly but not more than that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher rates are arriving amid mixed economic data on housing's improvement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes slipped in February from January but were still 9% higher than a year ago -- which was a dismally bad year. Also last month, building permits for single-family homes, which signal future construction, reached their highest rate in 22 months.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">'Sand states' see job gains amid uptick ; 'Drags' on economy are now boosting growth</span>
</div><div class="author">Paul Davidson   </div><div>Paul Davidson, USA TODAY</div>
<div>682 words</div><div>19 March 2012</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.3</div><div>English</div><div>© 2012 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The four states hit hardest by the housing bust -- Arizona, California, Florida and Nevada -- have seen job growth pick up noticeably in recent months. And that bodes well for the nation's employment picture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All four states are tourism and retirement meccas. They're benefiting as the housing crisis eases, Americans travel more amid the improving economy, and the flow of retirees to Sun Belt states picks up modestly after slowing to a trickle in the downturn, says Mark Zandi, chief economist of <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The states "were huge drags on the job market, and now, they're contributing to growth," Zandi says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From August through January, the rate of job gains in three of the four states equaled or exceeded the U.S. overall. Florida had been surpassing the nation until it lost 38,600 jobs in January, according to Labor Department figures released March 13. Still, the nearly 250,000 jobs added in the "sand states" in the six-month period account for nearly a quarter of the U.S. total, and <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> expects their rate of payroll growth to exceed the nation's this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That marks a dramatic turnaround. Job growth in all four states was slower than the nation's from early 2010 until last July, as falling home values slammed household wealth and the construction business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The states' unemployment rates still exceed the nation's 8.3%. Nevada had the nation's highest jobless rate in January at 12.7%. California was at 10.9%; Florida, 9.6%; and Arizona, 8.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They also face other formidable challenges as they continue to work through numerous foreclosures this year, and real estate prices fall further. But the housing price declines have eased, and both residential and commercial building are rebounding modestly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Moody's</span> expects housing permits to total about 164,000 this year in the four states, up from 106,000 in 2011, though that's far below levels reached during the real estate bubble. Permits will fall in Nevada this year before rising sharply in 2013, <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The spillovers from the housing bust are diminishing," <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> said in a recent report on the four states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sand states' rebound is good news because they have potential to power U.S. job growth, economists say. Zandi expects the sand states to lead the U.S. when their construction employment picks up more sharply next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, their leisure and hospitality employment averaged growth of 3.3% in 2011, vs. 2.3% in the U.S., as vacationers flocked to Florida beaches, Las Vegas casinos and Scottsdale, Ariz., resorts. Also, older Americans who had put off retirement began moving to the Sun Belt again, as their investment portfolios recovered and stabilizing real estate prices allowed some to sell their homes, Zandi says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 286,000 more residents moved into the four states than moved out in the year ended July 1, up from 172,000 two years earlier, according to the Census Bureau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other sectors are also growing. In California, booming social media, cloud computing and smartphone firms are hiring. Dan Losito, 31, recently quit his job as a stock compensation specialist at <span class="companylink">Fidelity Investments</span> in Kentucky to take a similar position at <span class="companylink">Motorola Mobility</span> in San Diego. There are "a lot more companies in the tech industry that give equity to employees," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tech job boom is having ripple effects. The Iron Cactus/ Creamery, a San Francisco cafe and sports bar, saw sales rise 35% last year, prompting it to hire 12 employees, general manager Ivor Bradley says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Tampa, biomedical firms are investing and hiring, says Bob Rohrlack, CEO of the Greater Tampa Chamber of Commerce. "When the economy went down, everyone was hunkering down," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, there's been a shift, he says, with businesses saying, "We're not going to wait for others to pull us out."</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Property taxes start to decline ; Analysis: Breaks will be seen on devalued homes</span>
</div><div class="author">Dennis Cauchon   </div><div>Dennis Cauchon, USA TODAY</div>
<div>511 words</div><div>13 March 2012</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>A.1</div><div>English</div><div>© 2012 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than five years after real estate prices began to tumble, Americans are finally starting to get property tax breaks on their devalued homes, a USA TODAY analysis finds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cities, counties and school districts today collect about 20% more in property taxes than they did in 2006, when home values were one-third higher than now, but the tax tide is slowly starting to recede.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, property tax collections rose just 1.2% -- and actually declined 0.9% when adjusted for inflation, according to data from the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis. That's the first time property tax collections have fallen below the inflation rate since 1995 and only the third time in 40 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the downward trend continues, property taxes may actually bring in fewer dollars this year than last -- even before adjusting for inflation. That hasn't happened since the Great Depression.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property taxes generated $436 billion last year, about $66 billion more than in 2006 when home values peaked. Public schools get about 40% of this money. The rest flows to other local governments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most states have complex laws that make property tax declines rare, small or long-delayed, even when home values plummet. This makes the property tax stable during economic turmoil, unlike the income or sales tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People say, 'Hey, my house value went down. How about my tax bill going down?' But it doesn't work that way," says Robert Ross, chief assessment officer for McHenry County, Ill., near Chicago. In Illinois, assessments are based on a formula that considers home values as far back as seven years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">School districts, already suffering from reduced state funding, are feeling the property tax squeeze most. Public schools have cut 270,000 employees -- 3.3% of their workforce -- since July 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're doing everything we can to save classroom teachers," says Alexandra Nicholson, superintendent of West Northfield School District 31 in Northbrook, Ill., which gets nearly all revenue from property taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The district will ask voters to approve a property tax hike on March 20 to avoid the elimination of sports, band, busing and educational assistants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Factors delaying lower property taxes:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tax limits. Most laws that cap property tax hikes have a little- known flip side: limits on decreases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Delayed assessments. Many states base tax assessments on a home's value three, six or even 10 years ago -- or on an average of multiple years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The practice protects homeowners from fast-rising taxes when home values soar, but also delays tax cuts when values fall. It also reduces the administrative burden of assessing every home annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shared sacrifice. New York, Ohio and many other states automatically raise property tax rates when real estate values fall and cut rates automatically when values rise, a practice called equalization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the real estate boom, this practice automatically lowered rates when values rose to prevent taxes from rising too quickly.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices fell sharply at the end of last year and a turnaround this year looks unlikely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices were down 4% in the fourth quarter from the same period in 2010, according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case-Shiller national home price index released Tuesday. Prices are nearly 34% below their peak in 2006's second quarter, rolling back average home prices to 2002 levels, the index shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's more, home prices fell in December from November in 18 of 20 leading cities, according to another Case-Shiller index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market "might be on the verge of recovery" but "might not," said the index's co-creator, Yale University economist Robert Shiller, in a conference call Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet there are more reasons for optimism now than there were at this time last year, he said. On the plus side, housing starts are up and unemployment is down from the same time a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet unemployment, at 8.3%, is still high. Gasoline prices are rising and it's still hard to get a home loan. Those factors will continue to restrain home buyers, Shiller says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, "People now know that house prices can fall," says economist Karl Case, Shiller's price index collaborator. That marks a "permanent shift" in the nation's thinking, he says. Before the recent downturn, home prices hadn't fallen nationally for decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Case described the market now as "the little engine that could." Household formation, which drives demand, rebounded in the last nine months of last year, he said. What's more, the inventory of homes for sale has declined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Previous signs of stabilization for home prices, such as in mid- 2011, proved untrue, said David Blitzer, chairman of S&amp;P's index committee. "Neither the economy nor consumer confidence was strong enough to move the market in a positive direction as the year ended," Blitzer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, Miami and Phoenix were the only two of 20 major cities posting monthly price gains, up 0.2% and 0.8%, respectively. Only Detroit experienced year-over-year gains, with prices there up 0.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller indexes include sales of distressed homes. That's one reason they show home prices falling, says IHS Global Insight economist Patrick Newport. Foreclosures picked up at the end of the year as lenders overcame some processing delays, says PNC Bank chief economist Stuart Hoffman. As that continues, PNC expects home prices to drop through the first half of this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another home price index, from the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span>, includes fewer sales of distressed homes. It shows that prices for non-distressed homes may be stabilizing, Newport says. Home prices, as measured by Case-Shiller, will drop another 5% to 10%, Newport predicts.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Phoenix shows healthier home signs ; Bidding wars are breaking out, prices rising in one of nation's hardest-hit markets</span>
</div><div class="author">Julie Schmit   </div><div>Julie Schmit, USA TODAY</div>
<div>937 words</div><div>28 February 2012</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.5</div><div>English</div><div>© 2012 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Phoenix housing market is showing signs of improvement, even generating bidding wars among buyers for lower-priced homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The area was one of the hardest hit by the foreclosure crisis. Prices had fallen 57% from their peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, "We list a property and, within two or three days, we have multiple offers," says Keith Krone of <span class="companylink">Keller Williams Realty</span> in a Phoenix suburb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While frustrating for buyers attempting to get homes at rock- bottom prices, it's a healthy sign of healing in a market scorched by the housing bust five years ago, say local Realtors and real estate experts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The area's January home sales were up 8.1% year-over-year. Multiple offers are common on lower-end homes, investor-buyers say. And the inventory of homes for sale is now well below the 10-year average, says Michael Orr, real estate expert at Arizona State University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">National data watchers have also seen improvements in Phoenix. In October and November, it was the only one of 20 major cities to see home values rise month-to-month, according to <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case- Shiller home price index, which reports December results today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phoenix "is probably the best example we have right now of a hard- hit market that's showing signs of recovery," says Zillow economist Stan Humphries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Making money on rentals</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strong demand for rental homes is boosting the market, Orr says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While home prices plummeted in the downturn, rents haven't, he says. That's lured mom-and-pop and institutional investors who are buying single-family homes to turn them into rentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, more than 25% of homes sold were bought by investors, Orr says. Historically, they account for 10% of Phoenix home purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investor demand for homes priced below $100,000 is "frenetic," says Laurie Hawkes, president of American Residential Properties. The real estate investment firm has bought almost 800 Phoenix-area homes in the past three years and turned them into rentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, cash buyers accounted for about 94% of purchases for homes that sold for less than $100,000, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The homes are often filled with people who lost single-family homes to foreclosure, Hawkes says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Job growth in the Phoenix area has also outpaced state and national averages since mid-2011, says a December report on the region by <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics. That drives rental demand, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices are responding in the lower end of the market, says James Breitenstein, CEO of Landsmith, an investment firm that's bought 225 Phoenix-area homes in the past year to rent out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Houses we used to buy for $50,000 are now creeping up to $60,000 or $70,000," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Arizona's relatively fast foreclosure process is also helping to clear inventories of distressed homes. The state is among those that do not require court approvals of foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About half the states do, including New York and Florida. In judicial foreclosure states, foreclosures have taken longer to complete. New rules since 2010 to ensure that foreclosures are done properly have extended time frames even more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Phoenix, it would take about 20 months -- half the national average -- to liquidate all homes currently in foreclosure or more than 90 days delinquent on loans, based on current foreclosure sales rates, says mortgage tracker LPS Applied Analytics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new government plan launched Monday should hasten the clearing of inventories of distressed homes, says Jim Belfiore, of Belfiore Real Estate Consulting in Phoenix. The government is offering to sell some foreclosed homes owned by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> in Phoenix and other cities to investors to turn into rentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Improved affordability</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to investors, first-time buyers are also active, as are vacation home buyers and people who lost homes earlier in the downturn, says Arthur Welch of Realty World Superstars in the Phoenix suburb of Buckeye.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More traditional buyers are also in the market, Belfiore says. "People who have sat on the sidelines sense that the bottom has been hit," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When compared against median incomes, Phoenix homes are 15% more affordable now than they were on average from 1985 to 2000, Zillow says. Record-low mortgage rates, around 4%, stretch buyers' dollars further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zillow expects Phoenix home values to rise 0.6% this year, vs. a 3.7% drop for the nation. Through November, Case-Shiller data show Phoenix home values down 3.6% year-over-year vs. a 3.7% decline for an index of 20 leading cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phoenix still faces big challenges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, the region posted the nation's sixth-highest metropolitan foreclosure rate, based on foreclosure filings by housing unit, market researcher RealtyTrac says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As those homes hit the market, they'll drive home prices lower, says <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> analyst Daniel Culbertson. Meanwhile, new single- family home construction will remain "lethargic," he wrote in the December report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's more, almost half the Arizona homes with mortgages were underwater at the end of September, says researcher <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>. That compares with about a fifth of homeowners nationwide who owe more on their mortgage than their homes are worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's harder for underwater homeowners to sell and then buy other homes. Normal resales in Phoenix aren't seeing higher prices yet, Orr says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, he says the market is poised for a "significant rise" in prices at the lower end. "We will have to wait and see if this possibility turns into reality," he says.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales are rising, but prices won't follow quickly in many markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes increased 4.3% in January from December to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.57 million, the National Association of Realtors reported Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While still weak, that was the highest level in 20 months, the third gain in four months and a 0.7% increase over January 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A housing market turnaround "may finally be starting," says Gus Faucher, senior economist at <span class="companylink">PNC Bank</span>, noting that home builder confidence and new home construction are also up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Falling inventories may be even more important than stronger sales, says Trulia economist Jed Kolko. In January, the unsold listed inventory was down almost 21% from a year earlier, NAR says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As demand tightens, prices typically rise. Yet Kolko and others say that may be far off in many markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost 3.9 million homeowners are in foreclosure or more than 90 days late on their mortgages, says LPS Applied Analytics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As those homes come to market, they'll "keep prices down even as sales pick up and the economy improves," Kolko says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Getting rid of the excess supply will be a "drawn-out affair" that will take at least two more years, says IHS Global Insight economist Patrick Newport.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IHS predicts home prices will continue to fall this year on a national basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Markets without high numbers of foreclosures will see prices stabilize, if they haven't already, Newport says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors, who are buying homes to turn into rentals, drove 23% of January sales, NAR says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some markets, such as Phoenix and Las Vegas, demand for distressed homes is especially strong, says Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He says the government's plan to sell foreclosed homes it owns to investors to turn into rentals may not be needed in some markets: "If the market is working, maybe it should just be left alone."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NAR revised down its December home sales rate to a pace of 4.4 million units. That means sales fell 0.5% instead of rising 5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The December numbers were adjusted more than normal as part of an annual recalculation of seasonal effects, such as stronger winter sales in recent years because investor-buyers are active all year.</p>

</div><div class="author">Julie Schmit   </div><div>Julie Schmit, USA TODAY</div>
<div>1555 words</div><div>15 February 2012</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>A.1</div><div>English</div><div>© 2012 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chicagoans Linda and Debra Basili thought about becoming landlords years ago. But even two professional women's combined salaries were no match for the Windy City's high housing prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then the biggest real estate crash since the Great Depression hit, driving down Chicago home prices by a third in five years. The 54-year-old twins took the leap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, they bought not one but two condominiums near downtown. They found renters within weeks, and the rent more than covers their costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Tell Donald Trump to look out," says Linda Basili, a State Farm insurance manager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mom and pop investors such as the Basilis are snapping up homes and condominiums to rent out all over the country. They're capitalizing on a confluence of events: depressed home prices, rising rents and strong rental demand. A typical plan? Buy cheap. Collect rents to cover costs. Cash out -- one day -- when home prices recover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"An unprecedented number of investors are looking into this," says John Burns, CEO of John Burns Real Estate Consulting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investor purchases are strengthening demand in a still-weak market for home sales. Through the first nine months of last year, investors bought more than 26% of single-family homes and condominiums sold in 167 U.S. markets, indicate data tracked by Burns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's up from 21% in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the U.S. government wants to capitalize on a strong rental market. It recently started a pilot program for investors to buy and rent out foreclosed homes owned by government-backed mortgage giants <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and the Federal Housing Administration. Together they own more than a quarter-million single-family homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a recent paper, the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> noted that "small investors" are buying foreclosed homes and converting them to rentals. It also said that larger investors were struggling to do so, in part because of tight financing and their inability to buy enough properties in the same area to make it worthwhile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Right now it's just that perfect storm for mom and pop investors," says David Hicks, co-president of HomeVesters of America, known as the "We Buy Ugly Houses" company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A multiyear investment</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As with any real estate buy, good timing is key.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jason Huerkamp, 35, a Coldwell Banker real estate agent in Minneapolis, got especially lucky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and his wife, Brooke, cashed out some stocks in 2006 to buy rentals in their former college town of Mankato, Minn. Nothing panned out, and home prices started what's turned into a five-year fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That was dumb luck," Huerkamp says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2009, the couple bought their first rental. "That was probably premature," he says, as home prices dropped further still.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, the couple have bought four rental homes, plus a duplex. They paid $310,000 for the properties and spent $90,000 to fix them up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, they take in about $7,100 a month in rent and clear about $2,700 after expenses, including financing costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While home-loan financing has tightened since the go-go days, the couple secured loans for all the rentals. They did have to put 20% down. Their interest rates are also higher than for owner-occupied homes. At today's rates, that might mean a 5% rate vs. a 4% rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Assuming home prices rise in three to five years, Huerkamp says the couple hope to sell the homes at a profit and buy small apartment buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"By the time we're 60, we hope to have 60 doors (rental units) and make that our retirement lifestyle," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That buy-and-hold mentality is now common among investors buying homes, says Zillow economist Stan Humphries. Unlike "flippers," who quickly bought and sold homes for a profit when prices were soaring, the buy-and-hold investors intend to keep properties for years, Humphries says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rental markets vary by city. An 8% annual return is now about the norm, with some markets higher and some lower, Burns says. That means that someone who buys a $100,000 property -- and pays cash for it -- makes $8,000 a year after expenses, including maintenance and taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given today's tight financing, Burns says, many rental properties are purchased with cash. Many banks will also lend to investors, assuming they have good credit, for three rentals in addition to a primary home, Hicks says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The soft costs</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Basilis' experience as landlords has also been positive, so far.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They rented both units quickly, one to a friend of a friend. The young professional renters pay on time. Except for a busted microwave and broken refrigerator, the units have been largely hassle-free.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That isn't everyone's experience, and a "fair number of people aren't cut out to be landlords," says Eric Tyson, co-author of Real Estate Investing for Dummies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Landlords not only have to be tough enough to evict people -- even families in the dead of winter as Huerkamp had to do -- but to take midnight calls about broken plumbing, confront late-paying tenants and live with a heightened risk of legal hassles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They also have to be able to "crunch the numbers," Tyson says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paying too much or underestimating the cost to make a place rentable can sink even cautious investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there's the risk of deadbeat tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shelley West, 49, a physical therapist in Tampa, just bought a $100,000 townhouse to turn into a rental. She and her husband, Tom, plan to rent it to a friend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She still thinks the rental market is a good business despite her experience renting out another home in 2008. In that home, the first tenant "was nice but couldn't pay after five months," West says. The second tenant stopped paying, too, and even demanded money back when West moved to evict him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Wests gave the tenant some money so that he wouldn't delay leaving, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The whole experience cost the Wests about $7,500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jason and Tammy Bezdicek experienced the emotional toll of becoming landlords.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, they bought a $140,000 home in St. Paul that had been flipped after going through foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The health care manager and pharmacist paid a "premium," to get a home that had been largely fixed up, Jason Bezdicek says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His plan was to rent it out without it taking over his life. He looked at more than 30 homes. He put each into a spreadsheet to calculate rents, taxes, assessments, insurance, utilities, repair, cash needed and the "time value of money" to calculate the years it would take to break even on the investment. They also put 20% down and financed the purchase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This home was the best," says Bezdicek, 34.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But then water leaked into the basement, requiring drainage improvements to the front yard. The couple put central air conditioning into the house and found that it needed a new furnace, too. That cost several thousand dollars. Someone had stuffed food, garbage and toys in air ducts that needed to be cleaned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bezdicek hired a company to screen applicants for credit scores and employment histories. But he showed the property himself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 20 applicants traipsed through.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They all loved it, took an application and then we didn't see them again," Bezdicek says. "It kind of stressed me a little bit."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The time he poured into the house caused some conflict at home, especially since the couple had a new baby .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Bezdicek says he had been keen to think of another rental purchase in the future, his wife "isn't sold on doing it again," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barring any disasters, he estimates it'll take them six years to recoup their initial investment, not including any home price appreciation that may occur.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We bought at the right time," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Risks exist in rental market</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buying a house cheaply and getting someone else to cover the costs sounds like a no-brainer financial move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are some big risks, given the potential for hidden costs and struggling tenants, Burns says. Because there are so many foreclosures in some cities, there's more danger now that someone might buy a rental only to see the neighborhood deteriorate around it, Burns says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's also the risk that too many people will turn rentals into cash-flow machines and then attempt to cash out at the same time if home prices rise, says Hessam Nadji, managing director of real estate investment services firm Marcus &amp; Millichap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They could flood the market," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate is also cyclical. Demand is strong now for single- family rentals because so many people are losing single-family homes to foreclosure, says Ronald Johnsey, president of apartment market researcher Axiometrics. But as foreclosure rates drop, home prices are likely to rise. That could inspire home buying and lessen single-family rental demand, Johnsey says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, though, many economists expect home prices to continue to fall and then flatten for some time. That will continue to lure real estate investors, real estate experts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For this year and next, the market will be hot," Humphries says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barb Jandric, the head of Minnesota's biggest real estate broker, hasn't seen the Minneapolis market boost sales without government aid in six years -- until a narrow gain in 2011. Ryland Chief Executive Larry Nicholson hasn't seen a yearly profit since before the recession, but the home builder expects one this year, buoyed by a 31% increase in homes on order at year's end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Enthusiasm about a housing rebound may be getting out of hand on Wall Street, where stock prices for home builders have jumped 20% to 134% since August even though housing starts are expected to rise just 15% to 20% this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke prepares for a major speech on housing today, talk is turning from when housing will hit bottom to whether it's time to buy housing stocks and count on the sector to propel the economy again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market still has big problems, from tight credit for all but government-backed loans to a glut of foreclosures expected to hit the market now that the nation's biggest mortgage servicers have reached a $25 billion settlement with state attorneys general and the federal government. On the other hand, prices are now below historical norms, relative to incomes and rents, in most of the nation, inventories of homes for sale are down and sales volumes began to pick up late in the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's beating on its own heartbeat now," said Jandric, president of Edina Realty in Edina, Minn. "Our big campaign for this year is to make sure home sellers understand things are different than a year ago. They don't know the market has been changing for the last six months."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stock market was first to pick up the idea that the housing market is turning. Shares of <span class="companylink">Hovnanian Enterprises</span>, a Red Bank, N.J.- based builder, have led the charge since summer. The caveat, though, is that the stock market has pushed builders' stocks higher in the fall and early winter for the last eight years in a row, leading to seven disappointments so far once the spring selling seasons failed to show hoped-for improvement, said Buck Horne, an analyst at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Fla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We still see long-term issues that have to be solved before we get back to what we've always thought of as normal levels of housing construction," Horne said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year's gains will still leave construction at less than half its pre-recession pace, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Better profits are beginning to turn around at big real estate companies. <span class="companylink">Berkshire Hathaway</span>, which owns Edina Realty, said its Home Services of America unit, which owns 22 regional real estate brokerages around the country, saw revenue rise 12% in the third quarter as profit doubled to $22 million. <span class="companylink">Realogy</span>, the franchiser that owns Coldwell Banker and Century 21, also reported that third- quarter sales rose. Both said sales in the first half of the year were below 2010, and neither has released fourth-quarter results yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even builders, who lost up to 90% of their stock market value from 2005 through last year, are feeling better. CEOs such as <span class="companylink">PulteGroup</span>'s Richard Dugas said they expect to return to profitability this year. Attendance at the National Association of Home Builders' annual trade show in Orlando, which Bernanke will address today, is up 10% this year, NAHB Chief Executive Officer Jerry Howard said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, there are warning flags in both the short and the long term. As many as a fifth of contracts to buy new homes are being canceled, usually because of credit concerns, Pulte disclosed in its year-end earnings report. And prices of existing homes were down 5% nationwide in December from a year earlier, Trulia.com chief economist Jed Kolko said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders hope Bernanke comes to Orlando and urges Congress to take more steps to help stem foreclosures and refinance mortgages for owners who are current on their payments but can't snag today's lower rates because they have no equity in their homes, and prods banks to loosen credit to both builders and home buyers, Howard said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One sign that smart investors are not counting on the rally to persist: BlackRock, the $3.5 trillion mutual-fund house, is reducing its positions in home-building stocks to take profits, said Robert Doll Jr., its chief equity strategist.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fewer Americans own homes and many of</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">them are continuing to see values decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. Census Bureau reported Tuesday that</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">the nation's homeownership rate fell to 66% in the</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">fourth quarter, continuing a seven-year drop from</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">a fourth-quarter peak of 69.2% in 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, U.S. home prices fell 1.3% in</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">November from October and were 3.7% below</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2010 levels, the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">home price index indicates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Falling homeownership</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">and prices reflect</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">the worst housing</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">downturn since the</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Great Depression. And</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">while there are signs that</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">the housing industry's</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">downturn may at least</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">be nearing a bottom, the</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">impact of the collapse</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">will be evident for years</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">to come, economists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of November, average</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home prices</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">were back to mid-2003</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">levels, S&amp;P says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Americans are less keen on homeownership</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">knowing now that prices can fall," says Paul Dales,</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">economist with Capital Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if people want to own a home, they may</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">not be able to, given the difficulty in getting</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">financing for a mortgage, Dales says. The National</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Association of Realtors says many purchase contracts</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">appear to be falling through for that reason.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists expect home prices to continue</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">to fall this year and maybe into next year</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">before stabilizing and then showing little or no</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">appreciation for some time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The trend is down, and there are few, if any,</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">signs in the numbers that a turning point is close</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">at hand," says David Blitzer, chairman of S&amp;P's</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">index committee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phoenix was the only city in Case-Shiller's 20-</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">city index where home prices rose in November</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">from October. They were up 0.6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a year-over-year basis, only two cities</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">showed rising values. Detroit was up 3.8%, and</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Washington, D.C., 0.5%, the Case-Shiller data</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While prices are still falling in most areas, there</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">are signs of increased home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales rose in December for the</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">third consecutive month, the National Association</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">of Realtors says. And pending home sales, while</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">dropping more than expected in December, were</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">still above levels a year before, NAR says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Home prices will be the last thing that moves</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">up" after increasing sales and shrinking inventories,</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blitzer says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The homeowner vacancy rate fell again in the</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">fourth quarter, the Census data show, to 2.3% from</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2.4% in the third quarter and from 2.7% in the</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">fourth quarter last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2.3% rate is the</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">lowest since early 2006</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">and "leaves the visible inventory</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">at a level consistent</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">with house prices</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">bottoming out later in the</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">year," Capital Economics</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop in homeownership</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">rates has been</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">most pronounced in the</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">West. As of the fourth</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">quarter, the homeownership</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">rate there stood at</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">60.1%, the Census data</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's down from 64.5% in the fourth quarter of</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2006, which is about when home prices began</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">their five-year tumble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The West is home to three of the states most</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">affected by foreclosures, which have hurt homeownership</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">rates. Nevada, Arizona and California</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">were the top three states last year with the</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">highest foreclosure rates, market researcher RealtyTrac</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While homeownership drops, more people</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">rent. Almost 34% of occupied homes in the fourth</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">quarter were rented, according to the Census data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's up slightly from the same quarter a year</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rental vacancy rate of 9.4% for the quarter</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">was the same as a year ago but down from above</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">10% rates in the fourth quarters of 2009 and 2008,</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Optimism is building that the housing industry is nearing a bottom -- finally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales and home building are forecast to rise this year after sliding steeply the past five years in housing's worst downturn since the Great Depression.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recovery is expected to be slow, and home prices are widely expected to fall this year. But investors are betting on the start of an upturn, bidding up home builder stocks and causing them to outperform the broader stock market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chief executives are more positive. <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span>'s Jamie Dimon said last week that housing is near its bottom but could stay there a year. Stuart Miller, CEO of home builder Lennar, said the market has started to stabilize because of low prices and record-low interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Market researcher <span class="companylink">RBC Capital Markets</span> has also turned from a "bearish" view on housing to saying that 2012 "will mark a step in the right direction."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists expect home prices to fall more this year because of foreclosures and other properties sold at very low prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As foreclosures pick up this year, "prices will drop," says Stan Humphries, Zillow chief economist. He says home prices won't bottom until later in 2012 or next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On average, prices have fallen by about a third since 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This year will feel a lot better to builders, investors and real estate agents than to consumers," says Jed Kolko, economist for real estate website Trulia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing's outlook is brightening with signs of a better economy. Last month, U.S. employers added 200,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate fell to 8.5%, lowest in nearly three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While an economic shock could derail progress, "there's now more evidence of improvement in the economy, and housing will follow the economy," says David Crowe, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders. More improvement is expected for:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales. Existing home sales will rise 12% this year after a 2% increase last year, and new home sales, coming off a horrid year, will jump 74% this year, <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics predicts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">November's existing home sales hit their highest mark in 10 months, and new home sales were the year's second best, IHS Global Insight says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction. Single-family housing starts will rise 37% this year, <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> predicts, after falling 9% last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builder stocks are on a run. The S&amp;P 1500 homebuilding index is up 38% since mid-October, vs. 7% for the S&amp;P 500.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flush with cash from an oil boom and plentiful jobs, North Dakotans are snapping up homes 1,500 miles away in balmy Arizona, where prices have plunged since the real estate bubble burst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It boils down to the weather and taking advantage of the market," says real estate agent Rocky Parra of HomeSmart Realty in Gilbert, Ariz., a Phoenix suburb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and wife Beverly, a native of Minot, N.D., have sold eight homes to North Dakotans in recent months. Parra is heading to North Dakota this month to meet with possible buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A lot of people have struck it rich," he says. "Oil companies are coming in and buying businesses and land. They're selling up there at the peak and buying down here at the bottom."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some want second homes. Others move outright.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blaine Bjella, 41, still owns three auto body and truck accessories businesses in his native Williston, N.D., the hub of the state's oil bonanza, which has pushed the state's unemployment rate to the lowest level in the nation (3.4%).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When an oil company made him an offer for the 6 acres that his log home sat on, he couldn't refuse. He moved his wife and three sons to a lake cabin he owns while they looked for a new house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High demand is causing a shortage of real estate in western North Dakota. That inspired Bjella to look south, where his father- in-law lives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I saw what you could get for the dollar, and we bought a house here in Mesa," Bjella says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bjellas found their dream home on an Arizona mountaintop: a new 8,000-square-foot estate in the Usery Mountains with pool and guest house on 1 acre with a panoramic view of Phoenix, Mesa and Scottsdale. The mansion was on sale for $5 million at the peak of the market, but Bjella bought it earlier this year for $2.1 million cash and moved his family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They really love it," he says on a recent December day when temperatures hovered near 60 degrees (barely 30 in Williston). "And it was an investment for me. It was a very, very good deal."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bjella goes back to North Dakota for a week each month to oversee his businesses, and he has bought 10 acres outside Williston to consolidate his shops on one site. He knows of more than 50 North Dakotans who are buying homes in the Phoenix area, where median housing prices (half are more and half are less) have fallen almost 55% since their peak of $264,100 in June 2006, according to <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not everyone is paying millions, Parra says. He has sold everything from homes costing about $200,000 to multimillion-dollar estates in gated communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weather and bargain prices are drawing many more North Dakotans now because small towns are overrun with oilfield workers sleeping in cars, motels or "man camps," compounds of modular, temporary housing for predominantly male oil workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The oil boom has changed the way of life," says Mark Schill, an economic development consultant with Praxis Strategy Group in Grand Forks, N.D. "The region has become fairly congested, with 15 to 20 oil trucks backed up (on roads)."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Williston grew 15% over the past decade, a big jump for a town that still has fewer than 15,000 residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Williston is overrun," Bjella says. "The traffic it's tough to get around."</p>

<div>465 words</div><div>22 December 2011</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.1</div><div>English</div><div>© 2011 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After years of pain and a market free fall that has shaved $6.8 trillion off the value of the nation's 104 million homes, the decline in U.S. house prices may be nearly over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. homeowners lost $681 billion this year, according to a study by real estate website operator Zillow set for release today. That's less than the $1.1 trillion drop in value in 2010, let alone the $2.7 trillion in losses in 2008, Zillow said. And a Zillow survey of 109 economists says U.S. home prices will stop falling late next year or early 2013, with the most optimistic quarter of economists predicting an 18% rebound by 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reason is that the economy is slowly turning around, as prices have come into balance with buyers' incomes and how much they'd pay to rent comparable homes, said David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>, which publishes the S&amp;P/ Case-Shiller national home price index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The negatives are that consumer confidence is low and there's an overhang of foreclosed homes whose owners will discount them for resale, economists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If it weren't for confidence and consumer debt, we'd be in a boom," Blitzer said. "Houses are cheaper than they have been since 2003, and mortgage rates are the lowest in 40 years."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two key numbers that foreshadowed the housing bust that began in 2006 now point to a stabilization and recovery, economists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ratio of the average home price to median income is now 13% lower than its average from 1990 to this year, <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> says. In 2005, the average price was 44% higher than the long-run average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ratio of rental costs to home-buying expenses is about 15% lower than in 2000, according to S&amp;P. At the peak, housing prices were about 20% higher than average, relative to rents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists differ over how sharp the housing recovery will be, said Stan Humphries, chief economist for Zillow. The most pessimistic economist in Zillow's survey thinks prices will decline an additional 26%, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His own forecast is 3% appreciation by 2016 -- total, not annually, he said. One reason is that unemployment, while falling, is still high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nation's largest real-estate brokerage firm expects little recovery without a turn in the job market, said Richard Smith, CEO of Realogy, owner of Coldwell Banker and Century 21.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't see a spiking recovery until there's an improvement in jobs, and until then it's a steady but slow recovery off a pretty dismal pace," Smith said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home prices slipped in September, and more declines are likely as the housing downturn nears its sixth year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices fell 0.6% in September from August and were down 3.6% from September last year, according to <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case- Shiller home price index of 20 leading U.S. cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, third-quarter home prices were at early 2003 levels, S&amp;P says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Further price declines this year and perhaps next are expected, economists say, because:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreclosures remain high. Nationwide, 12.6% of home loans were delinquent or already in foreclosure at the end of the third quarter, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. That equates to more than 6 million distressed homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreclosed homes typically sell at a deep discount. In October, foreclosed or short-sale homes made up 28% of existing home sales, the National Association of Realtors says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many borrowers are underwater. More than 22% of homeowners with a mortgage owe more on the home than it is worth, market researcher <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> reported Tuesday. That's 10.7 million borrowers. Another 2.4 million had less than 5% equity in their homes, <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When homeowners are underwater, they're less able to sell homes and buy new ones -- a key driver of housing demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Job growth is anemic. The unemployment rate has remained in a narrow range of 9% to 9.2% since April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much stronger job growth is needed to boost consumer confidence, which fell to recession-level lows last month but picked up this month, the Conference Board reported Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's moving in the right direction but off a very low base," says Stan Humphries, chief economist of real estate website Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He says home prices may bottom next year but then remain flat for three or four years. Or, they may fall throughout next year, then flatten for two or three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest factor likely to affect prices is the pace at which lenders push homes through the foreclosure process. The backlog of distressed homes has grown in the past year as lenders delayed or slowed foreclosures because of new state or court rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the third quarter, the Case-Shiller national index shows home prices down 3.9% from the same period last year. That was an improvement over the 5.8% year-over-year decline in the second quarter, S&amp;P says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's more, the annual rate of change in 14 of the 20 Case- Shiller cities improved in September vs. August. That means prices fell by smaller percentages in most of the cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Detroit and Washington were the only two cities to show prices up in September year-over-year. They were up 3.7% in Detroit and 1% in Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The plunging collapse of prices seen in 2007 to 2009 seems to be behind us," says David Blitzer, chairman of the S&amp;P index committee. "Any chance for a sustained recovery will probably need a stronger economy."</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Home market sees a sliver of good news ; Fewer behind on mortgages, building permits show uptick</span>
</div><div class="author">Julie Schmit   </div><div>Julie Schmit, USA TODAY</div>
<div>471 words</div><div>18 November 2011</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.3</div><div>English</div><div>© 2011 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The share of borrowers falling behind on home loans dropped in the third quarter, and building permits for single-family homes climbed in October to their highest level in 10 months, new data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reports bring "some of the most solid, relatively good news" that the housing sector has seen in some time, said Jed Kolko, chief economist for real estate website Trulia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mortgage Bankers Association said Thursday that the share of mortgage borrowers who have missed at least one payment -- but are not yet in foreclosure -- fell to 8% in the third quarter from 8.4% in the second quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The share of borrowers more than 30 days behind but less than 60 days late fell the most, to a four-year low of 3.2% from 3.5% in the second quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That drop suggests that fewer borrowers are falling behind for the first time, which will reduce foreclosures years from now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, 4.2 million borrowers are more than 90 days behind on their mortgages or are already in foreclosure. Most of those borrowers will lose their homes to foreclosure or other distressed sales in the coming years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That will continue to put pressure on home prices, said Paul Dales, economist at Capital Economics. He expects U.S. home prices, down about 4% from last year, to stay flat next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're moving in the right direction, but we're still well above normal" for troubled loans, said Michael Fratantoni, MBA's vice president of research and economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He says the number of new delinquencies should continue to decline if job growth continues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home building is also well below normal, even with the stronger October showing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts slipped slightly in October from September to an annual rate of 628,000, the Commerce Department said Thursday. That's about half the pace of long-term trends leading up to the housing bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family starts were up 3.9% from September. Permits, which are a better indicator of future activity, rose 5.1% for single- family homes and 24% for multifamily units, the Commerce Department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The October results point to a single-family market that's "finally getting off the mat" and a multifamily segment that's making "small strides," said Patrick Newport, economist at IHS Global Insight. Still, single-family home starts and permits are likely to set record lows this year, Newport says.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreclosure sales are moving so slowly in half of the states that at the current pace, it will take more than eight years on average to clear the 2.1 million homes in foreclosure or with seriously delinquent mortgages, new research shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's twice as long as a year ago in states where foreclosures go through courts -- before the mortgage industry was upended by disclosures that court papers in many foreclosure cases were improperly prepared. Since then, new checks have slowed the process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The backlogs suggest that the fallout from the nation's worst housing-market collapse is likely to weigh on real estate prices in many markets for years to come, and on some markets for longer than on others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York and New Jersey, where courts imposed new rules last fall, it would take lenders more than 50 years at their current pace to clear pipelines of homes that are seriously delinquent or in the foreclosure process, according to LPS Applied Analytics, which collects data on 40 million mortgage loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The process is moving faster in the other states, where courts aren't typically involved in foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In those, the time to clear foreclosure pipelines has remained at just under three years, according to LPS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California's pipeline would take about three years to clear, LPS says. In Nevada and Arizona, less than two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York, foreclosure lawyers now must affirm that they reviewed documents and asked lenders to verify their accuracy. Since that rule took hold last fall, foreclosure filings have slid to about 750 a month from 3,500, according to the office of the chief administrative judge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New Jersey, foreclosure activity was curbed after a court requirement that lending companies prove that their foreclosure processes were sound. The companies were cleared this fall to resume foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The longer time frames may support home prices by reducing the supply of distressed properties for sale. But they also delay recoveries because buyers may wait, fearing further price drops when distressed homes hit the market, says James Sacchio, RealtyTrac CEO.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a question of whether you rip the Band-Aid off quickly or slowly," says Herb Blecher, LPS senior vice president.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Economic reports may calm fears ; Inflation slows, housing starts up</span>
</div><div class="author">Tim Mullaney   </div><div>416 words</div><div>20 October 2011</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.3</div><div>English</div><div>© 2011 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inflation slowed from its summertime blip in September, housing starts rebounded, and the Federal Reserve reported signs of modest economic growth, suggesting that fears of a double-dip U.S. recession may have been overblown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer prices rose 0.3%, driven by cost increases for food and energy, while builders broke ground on new homes at an annual pace of 658,000 houses and apartments, the U.S. government said in two separate reports. Each was better than economists' forecasts. The Fed's "beige book" survey of business conditions said companies reported tourism and auto sales are leading growth in much of the nation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The news shows inflation is well under control and growth is still weak, said Diane Swonk, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Mesirow Financial</span> in Chicago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pockets of inflation in food and energy should slow as consumers balk and growth slows in developing nations that have pushed commodities prices higher, Swonk said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The essential story is that a very sluggish economy is keeping inflation in check," said Ken Goldstein, chief economist at the Conference Board in New York. "In August, we wondered if the economy was about to go off a cliff. Now, it looks like August was just a bad month."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The consensus before the report was that the consumer price index would rise 0.3%, and that the core inflation rate, excluding more volatile energy and food costs, would be 0.2%. Instead, the core rate was 0.1%, for a 12-month gain of 2.0%. The two reports follow a better-than-expected 1.1% retail sales gain in September, said Randell Moore, editor of the Blue Chip Economic Indicators newsletter. That makes a recession less likely, although falling savings rates and the looming expiration of last year's payroll tax cut mean consumers might not have the cash to keep spending, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest inflation flare-ups continue to be in food eaten at home and in energy, especially gasoline prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Groceries rose 0.6% in September and 6.3% for the last year, while energy jumped 2% last month, bringing its 12-month surge to 19.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Food inflation will likely slow soon, Swonk said. Last week's retail sales report said grocery store sales fell 0.3% in September as overall sales rose. Combined with falling after-inflation incomes since June, grocery-store data suggest consumers are switching to cheaper products, Swonk said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It used to be when someone was moving out of a house along mail carrier Rob McGregor's route, he'd see a "for sale" sign quickly go up in front.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, when houses along his northern Des Moines route empty out, it's not unusual for them to stay that way. There's no sign or Realtor's phone number or house-hunters stopping by.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stagnant home prices have become usual nationwide, and one of the big reasons is the giant shadow inventory -- the hundreds of thousands of homes like those on McGregor's route that are either in foreclosure or repossessed by banks but not yet on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already, more houses are for sale in America than people want to buy, and the roughly 1.6 million homes in the nation's shadow inventory promise to drag down home prices for years, experts say. States such as California, Florida, Illinois, Georgia and Ohio have the largest shadow inventories, according to RealtyTrac, a firm that tracks foreclosures and delinquent properties nationwide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Sale prices are down across the state, with none of the area being able to maintain more than a one-month growth in sales prices," said Bob Niemi, director of the Ohio Mortgage Bankers Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in Iowa, a state that had been largely immune from the bubble and bust of the housing market, empty off-the-market homes are a gathering cloud on the horizon, state mortgage bankers and real estate agents say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jayne Seelhammer lives in a working-class part of Des Moines along McGregor's route. She watched the family next door leave their home as HSBC Bank foreclosed in May 2010. It was more than a year before a "for sale" sign went up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason: <span class="companylink">HSBC</span> didn't get a title to the home until April 2011, according to court records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And odds are, when the house does sell, it will be for a greatly reduced price. Foreclosed homes on Seelhammer's block have sold for a fraction of their assessed value the past two years. According to the Polk County Assessor's office, one house assessed at $134,900 sold for $45,250 in February; another assessed at $75,600 sold for $40,000 in September 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ohio has almost 70,000 homes in its shadow inventory, according to RealtyTrac. California has nearly 270,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's absolutely an impediment," says Dustin Hobbs, a spokesman for the California Mortgage Bankers Association. "It's hanging over the market."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said there are two factors slowing the movement of foreclosed homes into the market. First, legislators imposed a moratorium on foreclosures in 2009, as well as imposing other delays. And lenders have imposed delays as they try to find ways to keep homeowners in their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But eventually, he says, "The market will have to cycle these homes through."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> estimates the national shadow inventory of homes is worth $405 billion. That's down from $433 billion in June, but S&amp;P still estimates the inventory will take four years to clear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We believe prices are likely to fall further as servicers clear the shadow inventory backlog and the properties under the distressed loans crowd the already weak housing market," wrote Diane Westerback, a managing director for S&amp;P.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a paradox for banks. If they clear the shadow inventory slowly, home prices will be depressed for an extended period. If it happens quickly, the glut will overwhelm the market and quickly drive down prices, the S&amp;P report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many foreclosed homes must be repaired and cleaned before they can go to market, said Jason Menke, a representative for West Des Moines-based <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo Home Mortgage</span>, the No. 1 mortgage lender in America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's in everybody's best interests to move the inventory of foreclosed homes as quickly as possible," Menke said. "We want to make sure that we are doing what we can to turn those houses into homes."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But foreclosed properties are taking longer to sell in all states, according to RealtyTrac, up from a national average of 164 days in June 2010 to 178 days a year later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neighborhood Finance, which makes loans to home buyers in some Des Moines neighborhoods, is trying to sell three foreclosed homes that have been renovated. An additional 10 homes are in foreclosure and will have to be sold eventually, said Holly Olson, the organization's director.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A baby swing sat empty in the living room of one such home in southeast Des Moines. A blanket and clothes hangers were scattered on the hardwood floor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Olson said the group has changed the locks and winterized the home so pipes won't burst during the cold months. Someone regularly checks on the home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jack Daugherty has been trying to sell a two-story home near Union Park, on Des Moines' east side, for three months. The house is listed at $150,000, but he believes the reason it hasn't sold isn't the price or the neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He thinks it's because buyers can't get financing, or they can't sell the home they live in now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Part of the problem is people are anxious about what's going to happen in the future," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Really, it's nobody's market," Daugherty said. "I don't think anybody's winning in this market."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like many homeowners selling in a stubbornly depressed market, Candy Spelling didn't get her asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her 14-bedroom, 57,000-square-foot mansion in the Holmby Hills section of west Los Angeles was on the market for 28 months -- at $150 million, the priciest private home ever listed in the United States. Spelling eventually accepted $85 million from Petra Ecclestone, the 22-year-old daughter of British billionaire Bernie Ecclestone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Spelling is feeling seller's remorse unloading The Manor, she is hiding it well. "At the time it was listed, $130 million was the bottom line. If market conditions had been better, maybe I would have gotten more," says Spelling, who pocketed another $6 million from Ecclestone on artwork and furnishings after closing the sale this summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a market where the housing bust has rippled through all price points, few entertainers, athletes, business tycoons or other well- heeled sellers are willing to share details about their pains or gains. But nowhere are the price cuts sharper -- or more visible -- than in the super and ultra-luxury markets, where prices, depending on location, range from $15 million to more than $50 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall home prices in 20 major markets are up slightly from 2010 over the four-month period ending in July, but values remain about 30% or more off their 2006 peak, according to Standard &amp; Poors Case- Shiller Home Price Index. Some high-end home prices have been battered by 50% or more. As the threats of a double-dip recession and another swoon in financial markets linger, high-end homes stretching from Beverly Hills to Park Avenue languish on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investment banker William Chadwick sought $65 million for his Malibu, Calif., estate in 2008. The price was slashed to $35 million, then the estate was put up for auction Sept. 18 -- a rarity on a stretch known as billionaires beach, where property owners include <span class="companylink">Oracle</span> CEO Larry Ellison and DreamWorks co-founder David Geffen. Opening bids for Chadwick's estate were set at $22 million, 66% off the initial asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We don't have a deal yet," says Tony Fitzgerald of Premiere Estates Auction, which is overseeing the Chadwick sale after the recent auction of an Austin estate for $6.2 million -- 64% below 2009's $17 million list price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fleur de Lys, the Versailles-style estate of Spelling's socialite neighbor, Suzanne Saperstein, has been on and off the market since 2005. Asking price: $125 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some deals are still eye-popping. Actress Jennifer Aniston recently sold her Beverly Hills estate for $35 million -- 17% below the $42 million asking price -- within four months of listing it. (Her ex-husband Brad Pitt sold his Malibu home for $13.5 million, 25% less than the $18 million he first sought in 2009.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But frequently even steep price cuts fail to attract interest. And many newer listings reflect the somber reality of lower values, a glut of luxury homes and an absence of deep-pocketed buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Actor/producer Mark Wahlberg's Beverly Hills home, for example, was listed at $16 million in 2008. It recently came back on the market for less than $14 million. Sharon Stone's Beverly Hills home, on and off the market several times, is priced at $9 million, 28% below its 2006 listing at $12.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower prices haven't helped move other properties, such as Michael Jackson's former Bel Air rental, Le Chateau d'Or. It's priced at $30 million, 25% off 2010's $40 million asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wrestler Hulk Hogan's Florida mansion, listed at $25 million in 2006, is still on the market, for just under $9 million. Singer/ songwriter Carole King's Robinson Bar Ranch, a 128-acre spread in Idaho's rugged Sawtooth National Recreation Area, was listed at $19 million in 2006, then dropped to $16 million earlier this year before being cut again to $11.9 million. Weight-loss queen Jenny Craig is trying to shed her 228-acre equestrian estate near San Diego; it's listed at $25 million, down from $30 million last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Except for pockets of prosperity, the high-end market "is absolutely dead across the board. There's a three-year supply of inventory," says Fitzgerald, a veteran Los Angeles broker. "Newer condos are down 50% from what they were selling at. There are stretches where they're off, 60%, 70%. I don't see any light at the end of the tunnel."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither does King's real estate agent, Sun Valley, Idaho-based Stoney Burke of Hall and Hall, whose ranch listings include a 1,750- acre spread near Wyoming's Grand Tetons on the market for $175 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Burke has weathered several recessions and depressed markets over nearly a 40-year career.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In the past, the very best properties would flat line for two or three years and go back up in value," he says. "This time, despite substantial price cuts, things are different. The buyers aren't there."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At these prices, "you're dealing with billionaires vs. millionaires, but every buyer wants to feel like they're getting a discount," says Sally Forster Jones, the Coldwell Banker agent who co-listed Spelling's home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, even the well-heeled are jostled by gyrations on Wall Street and overseas markets. "The daily ripples in the economy can have an impact. I just had a listing that fell out of escrow because of what was happening in the European financial markets," Jones says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York-based Realtor Raphael De Niro says that although sales picked up during the summer, prices remain below 2007's peak. And another Dow selloff could send the real estate market reeling because area sales are heavily influenced by Wall Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Caught 'with their pants down'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Observers such as Mark David, whose clever, often snarky Realestalker is among the most widely read and exhaustively reported blogs on celebrity real estate deals, notes that although it remains a buyer's market, interest is tepid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are fewer celebrities buying the massive, $20 million mansions," David says. "Part of this is the whole economic comedown. They're affected by all the same things that affect everyone else. When you have a lot of money, you can pay a premium. But they aren't making as much as they used to. And there's a little more modesty in their choices. The market that still sells are the $6 million (to) $10 million properties."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some celebrities have a knack for turning a profit. Others have owned for so long that they have amassed ample equity. Spelling and her late husband, TV mogul Aaron Spelling, spent less than $25 million on The Manor's 6-acre parcel and building the 123-room home during the 1980s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Relative newcomers and late-blooming "flippers" who bought near the market's peak aren't as lucky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are people who are good at flipping, and people who consistently lose," David says. "In this market, some got caught with their pants down. I still see prices coming down. And many, many foreclosures" for prominent homeowners. (Among the recent ones: actors Nicolas Cage and Burt Reynolds, singer Toni Braxton and former NBA star Allen Iverson.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, a celebrity home can attract plenty of attention on the market, but it's not always positive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You get a lot of tire-kickers and screwballs who can be a pain in the butt," Burke says. "You get people who get off making calls about an executive ranch, and it turns out they're living in a double-wide in Topeka."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">De Niro has parlayed some of his celebrity ties to success at Prudential Douglas Elliman, selling more than $600 million in property since getting his broker's license in 2004. As the son of actor Robert De Niro and actress Diahnne Abbott, he also has a bead on actors, musicians and athletes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of their notoriety, Realtors say celebrity sellers think their property is worth 20% more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Typically, there is no premium, unless you're Jackie O or there's historical value," De Niro says. "Selling is easier. The one issue is press. When you put it on the market, you make a price reduction, it's all scrutinized and chronicled."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Potential buyers also have privacy concerns, De Niro says. "There can be a lot of handlers and intermediaries -- sometimes, six or seven people. Or someone is being tailed by paparazzi. They'll rush through a showing because they're so distracted."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">De Niro also has a potentially tough client -- his folks. De Niro listed their West Village townhouse -- Abbott's former home -- for $14 million in July. "I was concerned how I was going to handle it and some of the attention it was going to get, but there's no trepidation from my parents," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was some needling about his commission, however.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We'll cut whatever deal we need to," De Niro says. "They tend to be pretty reasonable."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Privately shopping celebs' homes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many celebrity homes are sold as "pocket" listings -- off the grid of multiple listing services to maintain privacy and thwart stargazers. Others are acquired in relative anonymity, purchased through trusts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A lot of homes are shopped around in ways you never hear about," David says. "Sometimes celebrities have an accountant, manager or agent in common, and there are many transactions from those in the same social and business networks that are a world unto itself."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is that fine line between getting attention and maintaining your privacy," Jones says. "Some love it and want to be in the limelight, others don't want anyone knowing what they're buying or selling."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Realtors also must deal with quirky sellers. Jones, who has been selling high-end properties such as Spelling and Jackson's former homes for more than 30 years, was surprised to learn how she got Spelling's co-listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Unbeknownst to me, (Spelling's) dog Madison assisted in the process. She liked me," Rogers says. "Since then, I've tried extra hard being nice to every pet on a listing appointment."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Actress Julie Newmar, famous for her mid-1960s portrayal of Catwoman on TV's Batman, has owned investment properties for years, including a small apartment building. Her neighbors in Los Angeles' Brentwood section have included Rita Hayworth, Orson Welles and Sally Field.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Every few years, real estate takes a dump -- and this is kind of a long one," says Newmar, who has been unable to secure money to develop long-held commercial property. She has thought about selling, but not at distressed prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It might be a wonderful time to get in," she says. "If you have the cash."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spelling appears to have plenty, just from the recent sale. That didn't prevent her from haggling a better deal on her new luxury condo at the 42-story Century building in Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She had planned to pay about $47 million for her two-floor, 16,500-square-foot unit. With prices plunging, Spelling says she got it for about $34 million, a 28% reduction, plus perks including additional parking spaces, storage space and an office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I kept asking" for concessions, she said. "At one point, I was either going to buy the unit or walk away. But I'm very happy. We did well."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home prices showed signs of stabilizing in July, but more drops are expected later this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices rose 0.9% in July over June, marking the fourth- consecutive month of increases for the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case- Shiller index released Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increases were not a surprise given typical home-buying boosts in the spring and summer. S&amp;P cautioned that continued increases through the end of the year and better annual results must occur before it could confirm a housing market recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When adjusted for seasonal factors, home prices were essentially flat in July over June, S&amp;P's data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The housing market is still bottoming and has not turned around," says David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S&amp;P.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">July home prices were down 4.1% year over year, according to S&amp;P's index of 20 leading cities. Minneapolis and Phoenix led the declines, with prices in those areas down about 9% year-over-year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But 17 of 20 cities in the Case-Shiller index showed unadjusted increases in July over June, led by Detroit at 3.8%, Minneapolis at 2.6% and Washington at 2.4%. Las Vegas and Phoenix posted slight declines. Denver was flat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Washington has benefited from a relatively strong economy. Prices may be rising in Detroit simply because they've fallen so far, says Patrick Newport, IHS Global Insight economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When adjusted for seasonal factors, only eight of the 20 cities showed price gains in July over June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists expect home prices to drop this year, given weak consumer confidence and high unemployment. Despite historic levels of housing affordability and low mortgage rates, home buyers are "staying on the sidelines due to fear and uncertainty," says Stan Humphries, economist at real estate website Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices could also come under more pressure later this year as lenders pick up the pace on foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August, the number of default notices filed on U.S. housing units rose 33% from July, hitting a nine-month high, market researcher RealtyTrac reported earlier this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase may signal that lenders are starting to push through some of the foreclosures that were delayed after concerns arose last fall that companies were foreclosing on homes without adequate documentation, RealtyTrac says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Distressed homes can deflate prices for other homes. In August, distressed homes accounted for almost one-third of existing home sales, the National Association of Realtors says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IHS Global Insight predicts another 5% to 10% drop in home prices.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">How to break the cycle? ; Consumers won't spend until economy improves, which it won't until consumers spend</span>
</div><div class="author">John Waggoner   </div><div>1238 words</div><div>26 September 2011</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.1</div><div>English</div><div>© 2011 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're lusting for a Lexus or pining for a piano, you're part of a big crowd. Despite a jump in July, consumer spending has slowed to a crawl.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've been putting off a bathroom renovation and a new car," says Ken Whitehead, consultant for UnitedHealthcare in Franklin, Tenn. "We've been worried about the economy and the lack of growth that we've seen."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until consumers such as the Whiteheads start to buy the things they're yearning for, the economy will remain mired in a slump. Consumer spending is the main engine of U.S. economic growth. "Consumers are very apprehensive and cautious in spending, and we expect that to continue," says Diane Swonk, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Mesirow Financial</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's the question that politicians and economists are pondering now: What will it take to get you to open your wallet? Low interest rates haven't helped; tax cuts haven't, either. Raises and a better job market would be a big help, but businesses won't start hiring until -- you guessed it -- spending rises. "It's a Catch-22 situation," says Lynn Franco, chief economist for The Conference Board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A tenet of economics is that in a recession, people start pining for things they want, but can't afford. That's called pent-up consumer demand. Eventually, they save enough (or get more income) and break down and buy those things. When that happens, the recession ends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider your car. Increased auto sales don't just enrich car salesmen and car companies. There are hundreds of companies that make parts for cars, and that demand flows to them. Stepping further down the automotive food chain, increased auto sales means higher demand for raw materials, such as rubber, steel and plastics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's plenty of pent-up demand for new cars. The odds are good your current car is older than your last car was when you sold it. In 2010, the latest data available, the average car on the street was 11 years old, up from 8.4 years in 1995, according to Polk, which tracks auto data. More cars were scrapped in the 15 months ended March 2010 than were sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cars are better built than they used to be, which is one reason people are hanging on to them. But another is that people simply don't feel comfortable buying a new one in the current economy. "What we're seeing now is that consumers are more in favor of repairing an aging auto than taking on new debt," Franco says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Houses are the other obvious example. A new home means work for carpenters, construction workers, sawmill operators and real estate agents. But even if you buy an existing home, you'll probably also be in the market for carpet, furniture, drapes and lawn gnomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales have slowed to a trickle, although they're remarkably affordable. The median price of existing houses relative to average employment income per worker is at its lowest since the 1970s, says John Lonski, economist for <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics. Mortgage rates are at levels last seen in the Truman administration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks have also tightened lending standards following the 2008 mortgage-backed securities debacle. The number of people who can refinance -- those with sterling credit records and equity in their homes -- has shrunk dramatically.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most important, house prices have continued to swoon. The Standard and Poor's/Case-Shiller index of home prices is down 32% from its high in the first three months of 2006, and down 6% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People are fearful of further price declines," Lonski says. "They're waiting for home prices to bottom decisively."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keeping spending down</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A fistful of conditions -- some long term and intractable -- are keeping consumers from spending more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most obvious is unemployment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the jobless rate is 9.1% and new layoffs are announced almost weekly, people save instead of spend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultimately, saving is a good thing, because that money will get spent eventually. But as long as unemployment remains high, spending will lag.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm cutting back, unless it's for something vital," says Joe Micallizzi, 46, a baggage handler for <span class="companylink">Continental Airlines</span>. "I'm not too worried about my job, but I'm being cautious. You never know what any company might do."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corporate balance sheets might not be as robust as people think, Lonski says. True, large companies are sitting on a mountain of cash: Non-financial companies in the S&amp;P 500 stock index have $963 billion in cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But smaller companies have seen their cash stash dwindle 13.4% since the fourth quarter of 2007, Lonski says. Companies that aren't in the S&amp;P 500 account for 84% of all private-sector jobs. Companies with fewer than 50 employees account for 45% of all private-sector jobs. "Small to midsize businesses are not posting the same strong financial results that larger corporations are," Lonski says. As a result, they won't be hiring much, which dampens consumer spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other side effect of high unemployment: falling wages. Companies know they can hire a replacement for you -- and probably at a lower wage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, average wages, adjusted for inflation, have fallen, while employees have to pay an increasing portion of their health care and retirement costs. The upshot: Workers have less money to spend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are other factors keeping America's purse strings tied:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Political gridlock. The debt ceiling debacle in August that pushed the U.S. close to default and prompted <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> to downgrade the nation's credit rating left businesses uncertain about the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Gridlock is bad," Swonk says. "Paralysis is bad for business."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retail sales flatlined in August, Swonk says, and one reason was that confidence in government reached new lows during the debt debate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Global woes. Daily news of the possibility of a Greek default -- or worse -- does little to calm consumers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Age. The U.S. is getting older, and older people are more likely to be downsizing than spending. "It's really easier to sell to a younger market than an older one," Lonski says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as the 77 million Baby Boomers -- those born from 1946 to 1964 -- move into old age, they're less likely to spend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the big recession of 1980-1981, the population ages 15 to 49 was growing 1.3%, and the population ages 50 to 64 was actually shrinking, Lonski says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, the population ages 50 to 64 is growing at a 1.9% pace, vs. 0.1% for those ages 15 to 49.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"All the fiscal and monetary stimulus in the world won't make America young again," Lonski says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve on Wednesday announced a program of buying long-term Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities, in a bid to keep borrowing rates low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 4.09%, according to mortgage giant <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, few economists are expecting pent-up consumer demand to be released any time soon. "It's going to be a long, slow crawl," Swonk says. Fed actions will help on the margins, she says. "And when you have a marginal economy, every little bit helps."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More renters found housing unaffordable last year as incomes declined, and more are likely to be squeezed this year, given rising rents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The share of renters paying 30% or more of their household income on housing costs -- the government threshold to determine if housing is unaffordable -- rose to 53% last year from 51.5% in 2009 and about 50% in 2008, according to 2010 Census data released today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While median rents remained stable last year at $855 a month, median national household incomes, adjusted for inflation, fell 2.2% -- putting the squeeze on renter budgets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The share of renter households spending half or more of their income on housing rose to 27.4% last year from 26.4% in 2009, while the share of homeowners with mortgages in the same situation rose to 15.1% from 14.7%, the data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Americans continue to struggle to pay for housing, especially renters," says Daniel McCue, research manager at Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, 38% of homeowners with a mortgage paid 30% or more for housing. That was up only slightly from 37.6% in 2009, Census data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, the fact that percentage rose at all shows that many homeowners haven't been able to refinance mortgages, despite near record low interest rates, McCue says. Refinancing generally lowers monthly mortgage payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Census Bureau's definition of housing costs includes mortgage payments, insurance, taxes and utilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Renters will face higher costs this year, says Stan Humphries, economist for real estate website Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, rents are expected to rise about 4% this year, Humphries says, and will also rise in 2012. Strong demand is driving rents up as homeowners lose homes to foreclosure and become renters. Skittish consumers are also delaying home purchases, given concerns about the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The renter household market was fairly stable from 1990 to 2006, McCue says. But since 2006, when housing prices peaked, the number of renter households in the U.S. has grown each year. Last year, the share of occupied housing units that were rented increased to 34.6% from 34.1%, the Census data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While renters are likely to see rising prices this year, home buyers are benefiting from the best affordability conditions in a generation, says the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, home prices are down about 30% from their 2006 peak. Favorable affordability conditions and rising rents are driving some home purchases, says Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist. The association reported Wednesday that existing home sales in August rose 7.7% from July but sales are still extremely weak, says Patrick Newport, IHS Global Insight economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, the homeownership rate dipped last year to 65.4% from 65.9% the year before. The rate has been declining since 2006 when it was at 67.3%, this Census survey shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At some point, lower home prices and higher rents will attract more home buyers, Humphries says. "They will realize they can buy a home for less than it costs to rent," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already, investors are snapping up homes and converting them into rentals. In August, investors accounted for 22% of existing home sale activity, the NAR says. Cash buyers, who are most often investors, accounted for 29% of sales.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home prices rose 3.6% in the second quarter from the first, boosted by the spring buying season. But prices are expected to retreat this fall because of the struggling economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though prices rose quarter to quarter, they remain 5.9% below where they were last year, putting second-quarter U.S. home prices at 2003 levels, according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case- Shiller home price index released Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spring increase was widely expected, given long-standing buying patterns. When adjusted for seasonal factors, U.S. home prices in the second quarter were basically flat with the quarter before, the data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fall outlook is grimmer, economists say, following shocks to consumer confidence stemming from the U.S. and European debt crises, U.S. stock market turmoil, high unemployment and anemic job growth. Consumer confidence tanked in August to its lowest level in two years, The Conference Board said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drumbeat of bad economic news "increases the number of (home buyers) who'll sit on the fence," says Stan Humphries, chief economist for real estate website Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signals are already pointing to weak numbers. Pending home sales slipped 1.3% in July from June, the National Association of Realtors reported this week. Existing home sales in July also slipped from June levels. For the week ending Aug. 19, the latest data available, applications for mortgages to buy homes fell to a 15-year low, despite some of the lowest mortgage rates in decades, the Mortgage Bankers Association says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even before recent economic events, many economists expected home prices to continue to fall for much of this year. Zillow doesn't expect prices to bottom nationally until 2012. Now, even that prediction may be too optimistic, Humphries says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patrick Newport, economist for IHS Global Insight, too, says the housing situation appears more dire now than even a few months ago. "Buyers just got out of the market," Newport says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once prices do reach a floor, there is not going to be a rapid rebound, says Paul Dales, economist with Capital Economics. One big barrier to that: Almost one in four U.S. homeowners with a mortgage owes more on their home than it's worth. That destroys incentive to sell existing homes and buy different ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some markets are stronger than others. In Washington, D.C., second-quarter prices fell 1.2% year-over-year. In Boston, they were down 2.1%. But prices in Minneapolis were down almost 11%. Phoenix and Portland, Ore., posted declines in excess of 9%, the Case- Shiller data show.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A batch of disappointing economic reports and worries that the European debt crisis may be spreading deepened recession fears on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reports on jobless claims, home sales and manufacturing in the Mid-Atlantic all fell short of economists' estimates, while inflation was higher than forecast, raising the ugly specter of stagflation -- or slow growth and rising prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists say that's unlikely, noting inflation should ease soon as energy prices fall and those of cotton and other commodities stabilize. Still, a 0.2% rise in core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, could make it tougher for the Federal Reserve to stimulate growth in the short term by pumping more money into the economy, says Chris Christopher of IHS Global Insight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the reports may have been skewed at least in part by recent gloom created by the standoff in Congress about raising the debt ceiling and the downgrade of the U.S. credit rating. "I think they show that economic growth is still very weak," says Paul Dales, senior U.S. economist for Capital Economics. "However, we believe a recession will be avoided."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of Americans applying for jobless benefits jumped 9,000 to 408,000 last week, the Labor Department said. The four- week average fell 4,000 to 403,000 -- "consistent with job growth of 100,000 to 150,000 a month," says Diane Swonk, chief economist of <span class="companylink">Mesirow Financial</span>. That's enough to keep unemployment, now 9.1%, stable, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, existing-home sales slipped 3.5% in July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.7 million, the National Association of Realtors said. The group partly blamed numerous cancellations -- 16% of NAR members reported at least one last month -- caused by rejected mortgage applications or low property appraisals. Dales says recent market turmoil also may have spooked buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Europe, stocks plunged on fears that a debt crisis in countries such as Greece, Spain and Italy could spread as lending dries up and banks struggle to get access to capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crisis could cause U.S. banks holding European debt to conserve capital and pull back on lending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's concern on "whether Europe can get it together in time to prevent" a spread of the crisis, says Cornell University economist Eswar Prasad.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When architect James Tuer built a stunning, cedar-clad modern home overlooking Horseshoe Bay, near Vancouver, he couldn't move right in. So he rented it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and his wife, Penny, moved from Florida a year later in 2005, but they didn't want to break their tenant's lease. Instead, they renovated the basement, where they lived for four months. The result: a 440-square-foot rental unit, also with water views.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"On Bowen Island, it's very difficult for young people to find a place to live," Tuer says. He benefits, too. "The rent is great," he says. "It covers utilities and taxes."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuer's renovation reflects an accelerating trend toward adding second units to homes, whether for extra cash or elder care. These tidy units -- known as in-law suites, granny flats, sidekicks, backyard cottages or, in Australia, "kangaroo apartments" -- serve multiple purposes at a time retiring Baby Boomers are trying to stay in their homes despite shrinking stock portfolios, adult children can't find jobs and aging parents need help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes, they bring families closer together. And in the case of the late college football star Billy Bye (more about him later), they rekindled romance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cities see them as a way to expand affordable housing options while promoting smart growth. More are passing rules to make it easier to build second units, also called accessory dwelling units or ADUs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the laws are modeled after one advocated by the AARP and passed by Santa Cruz, Calif., in 2003 that prompted other cities in California and the Pacific Northwest to follow. Seattle began allowing detached backyard cottages in December 2009, and it received permit applications for 55 of them last year, plus 96 for attached units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spreading trend</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it's not just a phenomenon on the West Coast. ADU laws have recently passed in many places in the East, including Virginia's Arlington and Fairfax counties, and elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June, Denver revised its housing code to allow second units, and in July, Hudson, Wis., gave the nod to garage apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's very widespread," says Michael Litchfield, author of a book, In-Laws, Outlaws and Granny Flats, who lives in an in-law suite with 12-foot ceilings and quarry-tile floors in Point Reyes, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He says many of these units are converted garages, attics, unused rooms or basements, while others are additions or detached cottages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He surmises that most are illegal, citing the time and money involved to get permits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are a lot of these, but we don't have (Census) data," says Arthur Nelson, director of the University of Utah's Metropolitan Research Center. "People are doubling up, even tripling up," he says, because of tight budgets or economic worries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also spurring second units, Litchfield adds, is the "growing awareness of smart growth" and the environmental benefits of urban density and smaller homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a way of absorbing more people and growth without changing the nature of the neighborhood" and adding to sprawl, says Kaid Benfield of the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In-law suites have retained their popularity, unlike most single- use rooms, says Kermit Baker, who analyzes quarterly home surveys as chief economist of the American Institute of Architects. He says they reflect the overall U.S. trend toward smaller homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They come at a time when demand for rentals is increasing as many people cannot or do not want to buy homes. The vacancy rate for U.S. rental housing fell to 9.2% in the second quarter this year, down 0.5 percentage points from the first quarter, according to the Census Bureau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Census figures suggest the second-unit home trend will continue. Average U.S. household size, which dipped in the decades after World War II, has risen in recent years to 2.63 people in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, multigenerational households have become more common, accounting for 16% of the U.S. population in 2008 -- up from 12% in 1980 -- and projected to rise to 20% by 2030.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separate but near</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One such multigenerational household is the McKig residence in Berkeley, Calif. Billie McKig and her daughter, Suzie, had long talked about a dual living setup, so when they bought a home together in 2004, they made sure the backyard was large enough to add a cottage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They hired an architect to design a cozy, 540-square-foot, one- bedroom home for the elder McKig, who wanted lots of light, space to entertain friends and a fireplace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's open all around. The ceiling is high, and we built the patio around the oak tree," says Billie McKig, 87, a retired dental hygienist who downsized from a three-bedroom home in San Diego.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I just love not having so many material things," she says, noting how she gave away many items and kept only "prized" pieces. The result, she says, is a place that's easy to care for.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She sees her daughter often, but also has her own active life, including a bridge club. "I have my privacy," she says, "and she and her family have theirs."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not for everyone</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second units are not for everyone. "You'll have to trade some of your privacy and space," Litchfield warns in his book, adding that good design can mitigate the impact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If renting to strangers, homeowners have to be careful not to violate laws that bar discrimination based on age, gender, race, religion and family status. If questioned, they'll need to be able to justify why they chose a single librarian over a family with punk- clad teenagers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's also cost. Second units can be expensive, depending on how they're done. Litchfield says converting a few unused rooms is often the least expensive option but provides less privacy because of shared walls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuer says he spent about $50,000 to convert his home's basement into a studio apartment -- an amount he expects to recoup within 10 years through its $650 monthly rent. He made the unit attractive to get good tenants, a strategy that has worked. Too often, he says, homeowners make the mistake of using small windows and bare-bones appliances. With the main house's concrete floors, Tuer says, he doesn't hear the tenants below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Vancouver, where detached cottages also known as "laneway houses" have become popular, he's designed several, including one that cost $200,000 and rents for about $1,600 monthly. He says the owners have aging parents who may live there, or they may use it themselves at some point and rent out their main house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Seattle, Microhouse owner Bruce Parker is building backyard cottages, one of which is 800 square feet and costs about $125,000. If homeowners take on the hassle of adding a second unit, he says, "they're maxing out what they can do." An April report released by the city says the average size of these cottages is 540 square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many ADU laws limit their size and require that the homeowner live on the property and provide off-street parking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such issues have stirred controversy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Denver, resident Rick Schutz initially protested a zoning change, citing the potential for parking problems, fewer owner- occupied homes and two-story backyard cottages that block the sun for a neighbor's garden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city addressed his concerns before it revised its housing code, Schutz says, adding: "I can't see much problem with it now."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rekindled romance</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Minnetonka Beach, a suburb of Minneapolis, a second unit provided the right refuge for Billy Bye after his wife of 50 years, Peggy, passed away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"He just grieved so much," recalls Heidi Bye, his daughter-in- law, who watched as the once-well-known running back for the University of Minnesota struggled to live alone in a big townhouse filled with memories. "It was too hard for him."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She and her husband renovated a dilapidated apartment over their three-car garage. "He was close to us but had his own space," Bye says. He often had dinner with them and his granddaughter, who relished the time together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bye fondly remembers the day he came into her kitchen and told her: "Peggy said it was time to start dating again." He was in his mid-70s, and he showed her a list of about 30 women, some he'd known since kindergarten, who were single.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few months later, he met Sally, a woman whose name wasn't on the list. "He fell head over heels in love," Bye says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he took Sally back to his one-room garage apartment, he told Bye, he stood in the middle and said: "Well, here's my kitchen, and this is my bedroom and there's my family room and that's my office."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then taking her in his arms, and facing the roaring fireplace, he said, "And this is my dance floor." Within months, they were married.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quinton Anderson's back-to-school routine won't be all that routine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, the slender 17-year-old will carefully apply dressing to a left leg that was gouged and stripped of muscle when one of the deadliest tornadoes in U.S. history tore through his home and his life in May. Anderson's father and mother were killed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For three days, their son was missing and presumed a victim, too. Anderson also suffered a broken back, a fractured skull, a shattered eye socket and scrapes so frightful that he needed treatment in a burn unit. Almost three months later, the leg, which required skin grafts, is virtually all that's left to mend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I was bound and determined to heal myself, I guess as quick as my body would heal," Anderson says. "I never once thought that I wouldn't be able to go back to school."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others in this stricken city proclaim it little short of a miracle -- that in two days the senior will walk without help through the doors of a makeshift Joplin High School, that those doors are swinging open at all, that school is restarting as scheduled only 87 days after 200 mph winds carved a path of unthinkable destruction through the middle of town. The storm killed 160 people and injured more than 900.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The resumption of classes "is a benchmark the biggest benchmark since this storm," says Melodee Colbert-Kean, a city councilwoman and mayor pro tem, who maintained since the first days after the disaster that Joplin's recovery should start with its schools.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It gives hope. It gives us something to look forward to."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Church of Christ, where Anderson's father, Bill, was a deacon and Quinton returned to services last month, Pastor Richard Chambers says, "The word 'miracle' could be used in a variety of different senses. I think it would fit."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It hadn't occurred to school officials or anybody else, but many of Joplin's 19 public schools hugged a rough line running west to east through the city. That's exactly where the tornado passed on May 22, destroying four of the buildings and damaging two others so heavily that Superintendent C.J. Huff says they are unlikely to be reused.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of them, Irving Elementary, housed kindergarteners through fifth-graders who'll now attend classes in the district's 84-year- old Washington Campus building, which had been empty. In the days leading up to Wednesday's opening bell, it buzzed with happy activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Teachers filtered in to start readying their unfinished classrooms. Visiting children raced through hallways, dodging boxes of books and supplies. A couple of groups of volunteers, who'd bused in from a church in Cincinnati and a synagogue in Atlantic City did sorting, painting and other odd jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Principal Debbie Fort fairly gushed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our philosophy here," she says, "is the first couple of weeks we don't dig right into the curriculum. You get to know your students. You do a lot of team-building. You practice procedures. If you need to go to the bathroom, what are you going to do? If you need to sharpen your pencil, what are you going to do? What's our approach for walking in the hallways?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"But I think those two weeks will be a lot more hugging than in the past. We're always glad to see each other, but this year we're going to be ecstatic to see each other."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'How is that possible?'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Citywide, Joplin is gradually recuperating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials say most all of the 4.1 million cubic yards of commercial and residential debris has been cleared, and the destroyed <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span> and <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> stores are among the businesses already rebuilding. Here and there in flattened neighborhoods is the fresh-lumber framework of a new home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the 523 businesses affected, nearly 350 are reopened in permanent or temporary facilities. About 7,500 homes or individual apartments were demolished or heavily damaged. And although recovery there is slower, the city counts 1,700 as repaired and by last week had issued a 85 permits for new construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a couple of miles from each other, the more than half- century-old brick high school and nine-story St. John's Regional Medical Center -- flanked by its temporary quarters in a 9,000- square-foot tent -- are empty and disfigured, enduring as symbols of the tragedy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 600 eligible households need temporary housing, one- fifth of them living in two- and three-bedroom mobile homes provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The rest are due to move into similar units as soon as nearby storm shelters are set up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How deeply the storm will cut into Joplin's population, and its school enrollment, remains to be seen. Seven students were among those killed, along with a secretary at South Middle School: Quinton Anderson's mother, Sarah.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all, about 4,200 of the district's 7,700 students lived in the tornado's track.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Huff, the superintendent, says 92% of the affected families have indicated they're coming back. Within 48 hours of the massive twister's late-afternoon touchdown, he and other officials had decided that schools would reopen on time in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Architects and contractors said they could pull it off, but plenty of others wondered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I thought, 'I don't know how we can do this. How is that possible?'" high school Principal Kerry Sachetta says. "There were all kinds of ways you could have school, but not the school you want to have. Nobody wanted fields and fields and fields of modular units."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are a few. But Huff and his crew did some maneuvering to create room in their surviving schools. They found space for middle schoolers in an industrial park and for high school freshmen and sophomores at the downtown Memorial Educational Center, which had served as a high school, middle school and junior college since it was built in 1896.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The jewel, strange as it may sound, is an old Shopko department store in the Northpark Mall -- adjacent to <span class="companylink">Macy's</span> and across the parking lot from Sears -- that will house the 1,000 or so juniors and seniors who were displaced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An average of 60 workers have labored six days a week since the middle of June and fashioned a facility that, inside, looks and feels more like a college. There are large, open community areas. A health club and student-run coffee bar. Charging stations for laptop computers (purchased with a donation from the United Arab Emirates) that will be given free to every student.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 21st-century concept figures to be incorporated into the new permanent high school, which will be built in the next two to three years on the same site as the old, now-crumbling landmark at 20th Street and Indiana.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are memories there, so I'll miss it," says Mariah Sanders, 17, a senior who already has started practice with the JHS softball team. "But it's going to be totally new. It'll be something you can tell people in college that they'll never get to experience."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'Stuff happens in life'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of it, no one would want to experience. The school district is bringing in extra counselors to help students struggling to come to grips with what they've experienced and seen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We saw some things in summer school -- a lot of clinginess, a lot of fears, separation anxiety to a much higher degree than we typically experience, acting-out behavior by kids who don't typically act out," Huff says. "Those are all very much signs of trauma, and we're watching those kids very closely and starting to work with those families."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amy Jump and her sons were part of the procession of visitors through the Washington elementary school. Conner, 7, will be a second-grader. Caden, 6, will start first. Their family rode out the storm in the basement of their home near Irving Elementary, crawling from a window when it was over to discover they'd lost everything.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conner, his mother says, still is troubled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"He's had a hard time with everything. He's mad at everybody," Jump says. "It hit him a little bit harder, I think, probably just because he's a little bit older and more mature. And more sensitive. Caden just kind of goes with the flow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"But he's doing better. We're slowly replacing stuff and trying to get back to normal. Hopefully, we'll start to rebuild our house in a couple of weeks."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A day earlier, Quinton Anderson sat at the dining room table in the one-story home he's sharing with his sister, Grace. And with remarkable calm, he relived one of the most harrowing individual episodes of the storm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The family -- Bill, Sarah, Grace and Quinton -- lived just three blocks east of St. John's. Grace, 22, wasn't home when the skies darkened and the sirens began blaring late that Sunday afternoon. There was only time, Quinton says, for his parents and him to huddle in a hallway with their two dogs. They had no basement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quinton remembers seeing sky, feeling something hit his back, then nothing more. He was found Sunday night, though he's not sure where, and airlifted to Springfield. He had no ID and no way to tell attendants who he was until he woke Wednesday from an induced coma. A nurse tapped out a text message to his father's cellphone, which Grace had recovered from the rubble: Quinton was there, battered but alive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He remained hospitalized for 5 weeks. Grace gently broke the news about their mom and dad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Together, they moved into their grandparents' old home in Neosho, Mo., a half-hour's drive south. Bill had lived there when he was in high school. Like other students scattered by the storm, Quinton remains welcome in Joplin's schools.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The only way to keep going is forward, take each day as a gift and pray for the next one," he says, speaking over the hum of an overhead kitchen fan. "I guess it's my stubbornness. Move on. Stuff happens in life. You can't expect it to go good or go bad. You've just got to live in it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a straight-A student with a bent for science, living meant returning to school. The backup receiver on the high school football team can no longer take the field on Friday nights, but has been elected one of five senior captains. He still can play the viola in the school orchestra, serve as a National Honor Society officer, point toward graduation and college.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first-day bell sounds Wednesday morning at 8:30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Instead of being, like, wheeled in with a wheelchair or anything, I'm glad I get to walk in on my own power," says Anderson, his 6-foot frame still missing 30 of its onetime 160 pounds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Not being able to do things like football is kind of a small damper. But it's a small price to pay to be able to be where I'm at."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Come spring, if the leg fully heals, he hopes to run track. Maybe distance events. Maybe the long jump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A lot of people got it bad. A lot of them got a tough break. But if there's somebody out there who got it any worse than he did, I haven't met them yet," says football coach Chris Shields, who's entering his first season at Joplin. "I can tell you right now: I couldn't handle it as well as he has, especially at that age.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It would not shock me if he's running track in the spring."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perseverance and pluck have taken many forms since May 22.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ellie Benfield was headed into first grade at Irving Elementary. Her mother, Whitney, a teacher at the school, says she talked her through a range of emotions, then watched in June as the dimpled youngster set up a lemonade stand across the street from Irving's ruins. She collected $703 for tornado relief.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One early August morning found the 7-year-old at Washington, accompanying her mother to her new school. They made their way to a second-floor classroom, where Ellie -- in mismatched flip flops, her red hair pulled into pigtails -- soon walked to the chalkboard. She scrawled on a lower portion:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Welcome</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The little girl turned away momentarily, then turned back to the board and in two sweeps framed the words with a heart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bell rings there Wednesday at 7:45.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Falling mortgage rates are sparking a miniboom in refinancings among homeowners eager to save money -- but that won't be enough to cure an ailing economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage giant <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> says 15-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 3.5% this week, a record low, while 30-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 4.32%, the lowest in nine months and near a record low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower rates were only one bit of positive economic news Thursday. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average surged 423 points after the government said initial jobless claims fell to their lowest level since April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates have been falling with U.S. Treasury rates, as investors buy Treasuries as a haven amid fears about the economy and the debt crisis in Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While interest rates have been going down for three years, home sales have remained weak because of the dour economy. But refinance applications were up 30% for the week ended Aug. 5, putting them at their highest level of the year, the Mortgage Bankers Association says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That refinancing will free up cash for some homeowners. The low rates are also likely to spur at least some home sales. But they'll do little more than "soften the coming hit" to home sales expected from the stock market's recent drops and weaker consumer confidence, says Mark Zandi, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 63% of residential mortgages have interest rates above 5%, says market researcher <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>. Though today's rates would be attractive to many of those homeowners, the pool of people who can benefit is restricted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forty-six percent of homeowners with a mortgage have equity of 20% or less in their homes, <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> says. That makes refinancing harder without having to pay mortgage insurance. High unemployment and tight lending standards will also keep out many borrowers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of those who can refinance are trading 30-year mortgages for shorter terms with lower rates. In the first quarter, 34% of those refinancing who paid off a 30-year loan switched to a 20-year or 15- year product -- the highest share in seven years, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We'll continue to see more" of that, says <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> chief economist Frank Nothaft.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Hiltzik, columnist, in the Los Angeles Times: "What economists, stock market investors and certainly average American men and women want is more economic demand -- construction spending, paychecks, unemployment insurance, government assistance. Washington can provide that in the form of an economic stimulus package, one that puts people to work for state and local governments and on a wide range of public initiatives that improve education, transportation and the quality of life for millions of Americans. What our political leaders have given us instead is ideological posturing, threats of default, hand-wringing over government debt."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Terence Corcoran, columnist, in the Financial Post (Canada): "For nearly five years we've had massive and unprecedented run ups in government spending and debt in the United States and around the world. We've had vast expansion of government powers over banks, energy policy, financial markets, health care and other sectors. We've had staggering and unprecedented monetary policy interventions across Europe and in the United States. All of which have produced no growth and lousy job numbers, with the likelihood that the debts may not be repaid as a result. And the charge is laid that a small cadre of congenitally ineffectual free market libertarians is the cause of it all."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New York Times, in an editorial: "The focus on combating inflation at a time when the economy is clearly not overheating is akin to Washington's fixation on spending cuts when the economy is weak. This misjudgment has led Congress and the Obama administration to pursue budget cuts without additional near-term stimulus, thus increasing the risk of prolonged stagnation or, worse, renewed recession. And it has led the Fed to deliver a grim economic outlook without doing enough to get growth back on track. For starters, the Fed could take modest steps, like shifting its portfolio toward bonds with longer maturities, which would help to keep long-term rates low and nudge investors into riskier investments. It could reduce the interest it pays on the banks' huge reserves or even tax the reserves to try to encourage more lending. In the absence of stimulative fiscal policy, even assertive moves by the Fed are unlikely to turn the ailing economy around. But they could help, if only the Fed would deploy them."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kevin Warsh and Jeb Bush, in The Wall Street Journal: "Cutting spending is essential. But we will never cut our way to prosperity. So, what should be the economic grand strategy? In a word: growth. Fiscal and monetary policies can help mitigate the effects of shocks to the economy, but they run grave risks if their goal is to target asset prices. When investors' perceptions of Treasury securities change rapidly, they tend to be far less sure about the price of riskier assets, like stocks. The resulting volatility in financial markets harms growth."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zachary Karabell, economic research executive, in The Daily Beast: "The idea that the recent sell-off validated the grim news in the economy should have the corollary that Tuesday's massive surge validated a rosy view of just how stable everything is and how much we are thriving. Both conclusions would be wrong. Over time, financial markets do reflect underlying real-world economic fundamentals, but not at moments of massive capital flows in and out of stocks and bonds trading trillions of dollars, executed in milliseconds. Forcing a link won't make you money in the markets, and it won't help us solve pressing issues of where our economies are failing the needs of citizens."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW ORLEANS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decaying brick buildings of what was known as the Magnolia Projects are now rows of freshly painted town homes with ornate balconies and manicured lawns. Stoops where dealers once sold dope and shot at rivals have been replaced by a clubhouse featuring a flat-screen TV and a pool where neighborhood kids splash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Magnolia Projects, once one of the city's most notorious public housing complexes, today is Harmony Oaks Apartments, a 460- unit mix of government-subsidized and market-priced apartments. It replaces one of six public housing projects across the city recently razed to make room for new apartments and a fresh approach to housing the city's poor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I never thought I'd be able to live like this," says Harmony Oaks resident Larry Berzat, 60, who grew up in the former Magnolia Projects. "It's a whole lot safer. And a whole lot better."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Following a national trend, New Orleans' traditional model of corralling all subsidized housing into one location is being replaced by newer developments that mix subsidized and market- priced homes. More than 900 such units have opened in New Orleans already; an additional 3,100 are on the way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Public housing projects in Chicago, Atlanta, Salt Lake City and other cities have followed a similar trend, says Linda Couch of the Washington-based National Low-Income Housing Coalition. What makes New Orleans unusual is how the city toppled all of its major public housing projects at once, choosing a swift overhaul to its public housing over a phased redevelopment, Couch says. "People will be watching New Orleans closely," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residents and city leaders agree that the new developments are far more livable and draw less crime than the previous structures, some of which were more than 8 decades old. But housing advocates warn that the new plans will steeply drop the number of available public housing units, leaving thousands of low-income families without affordable places to live.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the city, about 3,500 fewer units will be available, says James Perry, head of the Greater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You're going to have a large number of people without housing," Perry says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of New Orleans' public housing complexes were built after the Great Depression as a way to create jobs, and the structures deteriorated over the decades, according to the Housing Authority of New Orleans. Neglect and the unsafe environs steadily drove residents away. Hurricane Katrina in 2005 further scattered residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the storm, only 5,000 families lived within the city's 12,000 public housing units, according to housing authority statistics. City leaders decided to knock them down and partner with private developers to rebuild.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tammy Cowart, 49, lived in one of the old complexes, the St. Bernard Housing Development. Drug dealers prowled the property and shootings were rampant, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, Cowart lives in a roomy one-bedroom apartment on the same land, redeveloped and renamed Columbia Parc at the Bayou District. Crime has all but vanished and some of her neighbors are even New Orleans police officers, she says. There's bingo night at the clubhouse, movie showings and a van that pulls into the complex every other week carrying job listings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a whole new world," says Cowart, who pays $72 a month for her apartment. "It's much better living." But better only for those who get in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Public housing units account for about one-third of the new developments, and many families who once lived in the projects will be left out, housing officials say. At 460-unit Harmony Oaks, for example, there's a 4,000-person waiting list.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Families who don't get into the complexes can apply for a federal voucher and live in market-priced apartments that accept them, says David Gilmore, a private contractor hired by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to oversee the New Orleans Housing Authority. But there's also a waiting list for those: about 22,000 families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shrinking budgets and lack of federal support have led local housing authorities across the USA to partner with private developers and build mixed-income projects that are better for the community but lower the overall number of subsidized units, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You have a choice," Gilmore says. "Do you serve 800 families in deplorable conditions or 300 in much better conditions? I know what choice I would make."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harmony Oaks once was the site of the C.J. Peete public housing complex, where crime rates routinely exceeded the city's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rapper Juvenile, who grew up in the projects, memorialized the complex's drug-and-violence culture in best-selling songs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, the new complex not only houses hundreds of low-income families in much better surroundings but also has spawned new businesses nearby, creating jobs and improving the neighborhood, says Lauren Anderson, who runs Neighborhood Housing Services, a local non-profit housing agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But something needs to be done for all those who don't get in, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You have to look at how else you're going to meet the need," Anderson says, "because the need is not going away."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- It's a business challenge fit for The Celebrity Apprentice, the reality TV hit starring real estate mogul Donald Trump: A broker helps land a lucrative licensing deal for a high- profile executive, who in turn allegedly cuts off payments to the broker. What would The Donald do?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A New York State Supreme Court may decide, because the executive starring in this real-life lawsuit is Trump himself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His company hired ALM International, a New York City-based firm, in 2003 to seek clothing industry licensing deals for the Trump brand, court records in the case show. ALM helped arrange a meeting that ultimately led apparel giant PVH, formerly known as Phillips- Van Heusen, to license Trump's name for a line of dress shirts and formal neckwear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ALM, now known as ALM Unlimited, argues that Trump improperly halted payments on the agreement in 2008 after 11 consecutive quarters in which the world-famous executive personally signed checks to the firm for its work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Part of the art of the deal is to comply with the deal, to fulfill your responsibilities," said ALM attorney Jay Itkowitz, pointedly invoking the title of Trump's signature business book. "We argue that he hasn't done that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think if this little problem was presented on his TV show, somebody might get called down to the boardroom," said Itkowitz.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This lawsuit is without merit and is very insignificant," said Trump in a telephone interview this week. His lawyer has moved to dismiss the case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Testifying in pretrial depositions, Trump and two of his business lieutenants gave contradictory statements on whether ALM should have been paid anything at all. Trump said the nearly three years of payments were a mistake because he wasn't aware of them, and "I don't feel that these people did very much, if anything, with respect to this deal."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trump attorney George Ross, an adviser seen on the Apprentice series, said ALM was entitled to far less than it got before the cutoff. But Cathy Glosser, Trump's executive vice president of global licensing, said Ross told her "to see to it that ALM got paid."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The previously unpublicized lawsuit offers a colorful inside glimpse of Trump's management style -- one in which he portrayed himself in his deposition as signing foot-high stacks of payment checks while only occasionally checking the invoices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additionally, the case is one of several civil lawsuits nationwide that allege that improper Trump actions in licensing or other business deals collectively cost clients, buyers or associates millions of dollars in losses. Coming after Trump this year flirted with a White House campaign for weeks before opting to continue with his TV series, some business experts and lawyers say the combined legal impact could jeopardize his brand's value -- a conclusion Trump emphatically disputed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The reputation of that brand is being diluted by these lawsuits. People may think twice before doing business with Donald Trump," said Nick O'Flaherty, strategy director for <span class="companylink">Wolff Olins</span>, a brand consulting firm whose clients include AOL, <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> and Skype.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Trump's deposition, he began licensing about 10 years ago. "It started with buildings, and then it went over to many other products" after the Apprentice series became a success, said Trump, adding, "It was my idea."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that idea, Glosser said in her deposition, was "terrific quality, at a great price point."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, fans who want to get their Trump on have a wide array of products to choose from. Trump video games. Trump chocolate. Trump tea. Trump ice. Trump furniture. Trump mattresses. Trump lighting. Trump home fragrance. Trump crystal. Trump eyewear. Trump cuff links and tie clips. Trump belts and small leather goods. And Trump business suits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Trump said he didn't recall his first product licensing deal, the one with PVH was among the earliest apparel agreements. And it was profitable, producing more than $3.2 million in royalties for Trump from 2005 through 2007, according to ALM's amended court complaint. PVH declined to comment on sales of the Trump line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Court records show ALM's agreement initially called for Trump to pay the firm 22.5% of royalties he received from apparel licensing deals the broker helped secure. A subsequent amendment that extended the deal's length and also covered any extensions of previously approved Trump licensing agreements with apparel firms cut ALM's percentage to 10%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Accordingly, ALM received more than $300,000 in fees until 2008, when the <span class="companylink">Trump Organization</span> cut off payments to the firm on the continuing apparel licensing deal. As Trump recounted it in his deposition, it was his insistence on signing all payment checks that detected what he termed the ALM payment "mistake."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I still use the old-fashioned method and I sign my own checks, but I sign so many of them over the course of a week or over the course of a month that it's a long, arduous process," said Trump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So arduous that "I have thousands of checks that I sign a week, and I don't look at very many of the checks; and eventually I did look, and when I saw them (ALM) I stopped paying them because I knew it was a mistake or somebody made a mistake," said Trump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to his deposition, Trump questioned whether he should have paid ALM anything, because the only agreement with the firm was a memorandum of understanding that never became a signed contract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trump acknowledged he signed that agreement. But he said he didn't realize it called for automatic renewals. "I've never heard of this, where ... a deal goes on forever. Normally, you get paid a fee, and you're finished. But this went on forever," said Trump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We paid as gentlemen, you could say," Trump said. "But ultimately, when we were unable to make a deal, we stopped paying."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ross said in his deposition he refused to advise Trump to sign a contract with ALM because the firm's payment percentage and lack of a termination clause were too high. But Ross said he didn't convey that to ALM representative Jeff Danzer in writing, because "that might have created a situation where he would kill the PVH deal, and I thought he was devious enough to do that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, Ross said in his deposition, he told Danzer that after the apparel deal was finalized, "We will sit down like gentlemen and work out what you should be entitled to." Ross added that he told Glosser "exactly the same thing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Glosser in her deposition offered a far different recollection of her conversations with Ross.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"He told me after I probed many times to find out if he had a signed deal with ALM ... that ALM was entitled to payment and to see to it that they got paid."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Itkowitz, ALM's attorney, offered his own conclusion. "This situation seems to be a case where a financially strong person is attempting to use economic power to get a better deal, namely to pay less than he's required to under the agreement," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If there are situations where it gets out that you're not going to fulfill your part of the deal, it creates the risk of damage to your reputation," added Itkowitz.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If so, the risk may have been heightened by other lawsuits against Trump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawsuits in other deals</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2005, Trump and Tampa officials announced plans for a 52- story condominium, one that would have been the city's tallest building. But the project, Trump Tower Tampa, slid into bankruptcy in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Would-be buyers allege in a Tampa federal court lawsuit they collectively lost nearly $8.5 million in deposits and interest. Defense attorneys argued in court filings that Trump wasn't the developer and had "absolutely no responsibility" for the project's failure or the losses. But the prospective buyers contend Trump misled them into believing he was deeply involved in the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"He chose not to disclose to the buyers that he was just a licenser ... that he could pull his name off the project," said Elaine Lucadano, who lost more than $45,000 of her condo deposit. She said buyers were "deceived" after being attracted by the Trump name.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trump Ocean Resort Baja was marketed in 2006 as a $200 million hotel condominium in Baja California, Mexico, with 526 luxury suites that owners could offer for rent when they weren't using them. The project, which the court complaint argues "was to be a Donald Trump development, with Donald Trump participating as a developer," collapsed before construction began.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scores of would-be buyers argue in a Los Angeles Superior Court lawsuit that they lost about $25 million. Both Trump and his partners in the deal contend they weren't the actual developers and thus bore no legal responsibility for the project's demise. Trump also argued unsuccessfully that the court lacked jurisdiction over a project in Mexico.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Their only mistake was believing what Donald Trump was saying," said Bart Ring, an attorney representing the would-be buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A federal lawsuit in Palm Beach charges that many prospective buyers lost money when they placed deposits on units at the Trump Ocean Club, a 70-story, sail-shaped condominium-hotel in Panama that opened this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Court papers filed by the would-be buyers argue the <span class="companylink">Trump Organization</span> originally said it would provide 70% financing to investors who put down 30% deposits. The buyers argue they were also told that those who bought two condo units could resell one at a profit before they would be required to close on the first purchase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both incentives were withdrawn, said Roderick Flynn Coleman, the lawyer who filed the case against Trump. Coleman said Trump also canceled plans for his organization to manage the hotel and a casino at the site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If this were in the United States ... if there were substantial changes like this that affect the contract, you'd have the right to cancel," said Coleman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The court dismissed the case based on Trump's argument that the purchase agreements included a stipulation that "any dispute ... will be subject ... to the courts of Panama." The ruling, which Coleman is appealing, allows the would-be buyers to refile the case if the Panamanian legal system deprives them of any chance to recover alleged damages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trump is also being sued by former students of Trump University, now known as the Trump Entrepreneur Initiative. They argue they were defrauded of as much as $35,000 each by promises they would learn secrets of real estate success from teachers "handpicked" by Trump. Arguing the former students suffered no harm, Trump moved to dismiss the case. But a California federal judge in May ruled parts of the lawsuit should proceed. The court has scheduled a conference with both sides next month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A luxury brand</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, Trump has licensed his name to successful deals in real estate and other ventures. In Toronto, he has partnered with one of Canada's wealthiest businessmen on a luxury tower expected to open this year. That and successful projects in Las Vegas, Chicago and elsewhere have given Trump "a strong reputation as a luxury brand" in the hotel-condo sector, said Sean Hennessey of Lodging Advisors, a New York consultant for hotel investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think they are very conscientious that their name isn't attached to a fly-by-night developer," said Hennessey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, he said, Trump should consider extra measures to guard his brand, such as taking more of an investor and management role in his deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Branding expert O'Flaherty suggested Trump should "decide what his brand is" and be more judicious in his licensing deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What he stood for -- the American dream -- is slowly being drained away by overextension, putting his name on everything from real estate to mattresses," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Trump, in a pretrial deposition for the Tampa case, said he carefully guards his name. "When I own something, I work very hard to make sure it is successful," he said. "If we license something, we also make sure we try our best to make it very successful."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Citing a recent surge in demand for units at Trump Towers in Sunny Isles Beach, Fla., a licensing deal slammed by the recession, Trump added in the telephone interview: "The brand has never been hotter than it is today."</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Home prices bounce back some ; Could start falling again after spring buying season</span>
</div><div class="author">Julie Schmit   </div><div>Julie Schmit, USA TODAY</div>
<div>519 words</div><div>27 July 2011</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.3</div><div>English</div><div>© 2011 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home prices edged up in May for the second-consecutive month, easing some recent concern about further big price drops over the next few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices rose 1% in May from April, thanks largely to the spring buying season, according to Tuesday's release of <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller home price index for 20 major metropolitan areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increases were broad, hitting 16 of the 20 regions. While prices typically rise in the spring, the fact that they're doing so this year -- after five years of generally declining prices -- is significant, economists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's no clear up trend, but the good news is there's no clear down trend, either," says David Blitzer, chairman of the S&amp;P index committee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other recent housing statistics support the "bounce-along-the- bottom" scenario, S&amp;P says. New single-family home sales in June fell 1% from May but were up 1.6% from a year ago, the U.S. Department of Commerce said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists expect national home prices, down more than 30% since their 2006 peak, to continue to decline for the rest of this year and perhaps into next.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economist Robert Shiller, who co-developed the closely watched Case-Shiller index, set off alarms in February by predicting that home prices could fall 10% to 25% over the next few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a Web chat session Tuesday, Shiller said the recent data "lowers the probability of that scenario a little bit, but I still worry about it." IHS Global Insight says prices could resume falling after the spring buying season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When adjusted for seasonal factors, home prices were largely flat in May from April, the Case-Shiller index shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But seasonal adjustments are now being skewed by the large number of foreclosure sales, which aren't affected by seasonal factors as much as non-distressed home sales are, Blitzer says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the monthly numbers were encouraging, all but one of the Case-Shiller cities saw prices down year-over-year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 20-city index posted a 4.5% drop in May from May 2010 -- its biggest year-over-year drop since late 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was also a worse showing than in April, when prices were down 4% year over year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only Washington, D.C., posted a year-over-year gain, with prices up 1.3%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Minneapolis saw the biggest annual drop, with prices down 11.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price changes also vary by type of home. S&amp;P data show that lower- priced homes in some markets are still losing value at a sharp rate, while higher-priced homes are in better shape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Atlanta, lower-priced homes now have average values about 40% below those of January 2000. Higher-priced homes there have values 9% above 2000 levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The situation is similar in Chicago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those markets are still suffering from the "subprime fallout" when risky loans were extended to people who've since faced foreclosure, S&amp;P says.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Sales of existing homes decline ; Appraisal, credit issues blamed</span>
</div><div class="author">Julie Schmit   </div><div>Julie Schmit, USA TODAY</div>
<div>396 words</div><div>21 July 2011</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.3</div><div>English</div><div>© 2011 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales slipped in June to the lowest in seven months as the U.S. housing market struggles to find traction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes, including single-family homes, condominiums and townhouses, dropped 0.8% in June from May and 8.8% below June last year, when sales were boosted by federal tax credits, the National Association of Realtors reported Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results were worse than forecast, underscoring that a variety of factors are weighing on the market, including the recent deterioration in the pace of the U.S. economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Demand is just really weak because people are worried," says Patrick Newport, economist with IHS Global Insight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June, 16% of Realtors said they had home sale contracts canceled, up from 4% in May. The reason for so many cancellations remains a "mystery," says Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he says that tight credit conditions and low appraisals -- both of which can kill home sale deals -- are prime culprits. Concerns about Washington's standoff over the federal debt ceiling may also be "causing hesitation" among some consumers and lenders, Yun says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the slowdown in sales in June, the median price edged up to $184,300. That's up 0.8% from a year earlier. Median prices fell in the South and Midwest, but rose 3.1% year over year in the Northeast and 9.5% in the West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those increases may have more to do with the mix of homes selling than with any sustained rebound in prices, Newport says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median prices rise if higher-priced home sales make up more of the sales. That may be occurring if those buyers are locking in deals to get the best mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of October, the size of loans that government-backed mortgage giants <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> and <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> can buy from lenders is expected to drop in many higher-priced regions. That may make bigger loans more expensive and harder to get.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The coming change is already affecting some sales contracts, the NAR says. Some lenders are enforcing the lower loan limits now, anticipating that deals may not close before Oct. 1, the association says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most U.S. economists expect home prices, down 30% from their 2006 peak, to continue to fall this year and perhaps next.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreclosure delays are likely to bring reprieves to 1 million financially troubled homeowners this year, but they threaten to further postpone the U.S. housing market's recovery, a report out today shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreclosure actions -- including default notices, auction sale notices and bank repossessions -- will be filed on about 2 million homes this year, 1 million fewer than there should be based on the number of delinquent loans, says market researcher RealtyTrac.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Delays occur for a variety of reasons, including mortgage servicing firms' uncertainty about future foreclosure rules. Federal and state officials and the mortgage industry are negotiating a settlement that is likely to define those.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The delays mean borrowers get more time in homes without paying mortgages. They also have led to fewer distressed homes for sale, which has probably curbed price declines, says economist Mark Zandi at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the delays extend the time to clear the housing market's supply of distressed homes, which pull down prices of other homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Foreclosures are getting delayed and that will delay the housing recovery, too," says RealtyTrac Senior Vice President Rick Sharga.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, more than 6 million home loans are delinquent or in foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices, down more than 30% from their 2006 peak, cannot rebound until there are fewer distressed home sales, says Stan Humphries, chief economist for real estate website <span class="companylink">Zillow.com</span>. Current and future foreclosures and high unemployment are the two biggest drags on the U.S. housing market, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May, distressed homes accounted for 31% of existing home sales, selling at a 20% discount to non-distressed homes, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreclosures may pick up late this year or early next as uncertainty about new regulations subsides, says Jason Kopcak, a mortgage loan expert at <span class="companylink">Cantor Fitzgerald</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Companies have probably delayed foreclosures as they await the federal-state settlement, Sharga says. Major mortgage servicers submitted plans Wednesday to improve their processes that were mandated by federal banking regulators. Those plans will be reviewed by regulators and may change depending on the settlement with state and federal officials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The foreclosure slowdown began last fall after revelations that tens of thousands of foreclosure cases may have been improperly handled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreclosure filings through June were down 29% year-over-year, RealtyTrac says. Homes lost to foreclosure in the second quarter were in the foreclosure process for an average 318 days -- 41 days longer than in the same quarter last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The falloff in foreclosures has been sharper in some states. In Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey and New York, foreclosure sales are down more than 70% since September, says mortgage tracker LPS Applied Analytics. The average drop nationwide was 37%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">States that clear their foreclosures quickly will probably see prices increase faster than those that take longer to absorb foreclosure inventories, Zandi says.</p>

</div><div class="author">Julie Schmit </div><div>Julie Schmit, USA TODAY</div>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market is hurting nationally, but it appears to be marching toward recovery in a handful of mostly rural states, economic forecasters say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The states including North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa and Alaska have economies more dependent on the energy, industrial or agricultural sectors, the stronger parts of the U.S. economy. Their home prices, in general, didn't rise as much as in other states in the boom years, so they've fared better in the wake of the crash. Their unemployment rates tend to best the national average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Housing is a mess all over the place, but it's less of a mess in some places," says Jim Diffley, regional housing economist for IHS Global Insight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several of the smaller Midwestern states appear "on the road to recovery," says Jonathan Smoke, executive director for research for Housing IntelligencePro, which tracks real estate in 800 markets nationwide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company compared sales of homes not hit or threatened by foreclosures for the 12 months ending in March with sales in 2006, the peak of the national housing bubble. Excluding distressed sales gives researchers a better view of what normal housing markets look like.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">North Dakota, Iowa and Wyoming have seen the strongest rebound in numbers of non-distressed home sales, the data show. North Dakota was the only state where sales in the recent period rose from 2006, Housing Intelligence found. Iowa and Wyoming reached about 70% of their 2006 levels. In 34 of 47 states for which data were available, volumes were at less than half their 2006 levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oklahoma and Nebraska saw the biggest jumps in prices per square foot for non-distressed homes: 17% and 12%, respectively. Prices on a per-square-foot basis offer some adjustment for different types of homes that may be selling at any given time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">South Dakota and Alaska also appear among the states "least vulnerable" to further home price declines given their stronger economies, says Capital Economics economist Paul Dales. In the first quarter, Alaska house prices rose 2.7% year-over-year, according to the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span>. They fell 5.5% nationally. South Dakota has one of the nation's lowest unemployment rates, at 4.8% in May vs. 9.1% nationwide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales data also show strong demand for housing in the state, Dales says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">States with fewer troubled loans are likely to have fewer foreclosures, which can be a drag on prices. As of May, the states with the lowest percentage of loans that were delinquent or in foreclosure were Montana, Wyoming, Arkansas, South Dakota and North Dakota, says Lender Processing Services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No U.S. region is likely to see stable prices until late this year. Some may decline longer, <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics says. The slowing pace of the U.S. economic recovery also poses risks for Midwestern economies, which have benefited from strengthening in manufacturing, <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> says.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">April saw slightly higher home prices ; Months more of gains needed to call it a recovery</span>
</div><div class="author">Julie Schmit   </div><div>Julie Schmit, USA TODAY</div>
<div>440 words</div><div>29 June 2011</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.1</div><div>English</div><div>© 2011 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home prices edged up in April as the spring buying season began, but several more months of the same are needed to say the market has bottomed, economists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the first time in eight months, home prices posted a monthly increase in April, up 0.7% from March, according to Tuesday's release of <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller home price index covering 20 major cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The uptick, while providing a glimmer of good news in the beleaguered housing industry, was driven mostly by a typical bump in spring home sales rather than any substantial change in market fundamentals, S&amp;P says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other recent housing statistics have shown mixed results. Single- family housing starts were up in May but were well below last year's levels. But sales of existing and new homes dropped in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is much too early to tell if this is a turning point or simply due to some warmer weather," says David Blitzer, chairman of S&amp;P's index committee. Several more months of increasing home prices are needed to call it a "real recovery," S&amp;P adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While getting a spring boost, April home prices were down 4% year- over-year for Case-Shiller's composite index. That was the largest year-on-year drop in 10 months. Washington, D.C., was the only metropolitan region to post a gain, up 4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, IHS Global Insight expects home prices to fall 5% more this year. Real estate website <span class="companylink">Zillow.com</span> also expects price drops this year and next before the market bottoms, at the earliest, in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Things are moving in the right direction," says <span class="companylink">Zillow.com</span> chief economist Stan Humphries. But even after housing bottoms, it'll be two to four years before prices rise, he says. After that, he looks for appreciation in the historically normal range of 2% to 4% a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the housing bubble burst in 2006, U.S. home prices have fallen 33% more than they did during the Great Depression. Lower- priced homes are the most vulnerable to continued price drops, says researcher Capital Economics. Since 2007, prices for lower-end homes have fallen 45% vs. 25% declines for the highest-price homes, Capital says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tightened credit standards, especially for first-time buyers, and big numbers of foreclosures in the lower end of the market will continue to put more pressure on prices for those homes than on higher-priced homes, says Capital economist Paul Dales.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sour reports Thursday on the number of people who sought unemployment benefits and buyers of new homes illustrate what Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke acknowledged Wednesday: Many factors weighing on the economy are proving to be more chronic than first imagined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Applications for unemployment benefits rose to a seasonally adjusted 429,000 last week, the Labor Department said Thursday. It was the biggest jump in a month and marked the 11th-consecutive week that applications have been above 400,000. Elevated unemployment benefit claims signal a worsening job market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home sales fell in May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 319,000, the Commerce Department said. That's fewer than half the 700,000 that economists say must be sold to sustain a healthy housing market. Sales of new homes have fallen 18% in the two years since the recession ended.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year was the worst for new home sales on records dating back half a century.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What would help the economy most are jobs, analysts say. But according to an Associated Press economy survey last week, the nation will add only about 1.9 million jobs this year, and the unemployment rate will fall to only 8.7%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy needs to generate at least 125,000 jobs per month to keep up with population growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least twice that many jobs are needed to bring down the unemployment rate, which rose to 9.1% in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employers added only 54,000 net new jobs in May, much slower than the average gain of 220,000 per month in the previous three months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unemployment applications fell as low as 375,000 in February, a level that signals sustainable job growth. But applications surged in April to an eight-month high of 478,000 and have shown only modest improvement since that time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The four-week average for unemployment benefit applications, a less volatile measure, was unchanged last week at 426,250.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We need initial claims to fall back below 400,000 to signal stronger economic growth than the area we seem to be mired in," said analysts John Ryding and Conrad DeQuadros at RDQ.</p>

</div><div class="author">Julie Schmit   </div><div>Julie Schmit, USA TODAY</div>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cash buyers are snapping up homes in markets nationwide, betting that deals won't get much better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, all-cash buyers accounted for 30% of existing home sales, up from 25% in May 2010, and 12% two years ago, says the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cash buyers, who are mostly investors, accounted for at least 30% of existing-home sales for the fifth-straight month, the association says. They hit 35% of buyers in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cash buyers are enticed by low prices and potential rental income, economists say. But while their activity has helped curb price drops, price increases have yet to follow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May, the median price of an existing single-family home fell 4.5% to $166,700 from a year ago, the association reported Tuesday. Volume also dropped. Existing home sales in the month including single family, condos and townhouses were down 15% from the previous May, when a federal tax credit boosted sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without cash buyers, "We would be in much worse shape than we are," says Jim Gillespie, CEO of <span class="companylink">Coldwell Banker Real Estate</span>. "They recognize that this is the smartest time to buy," because U.S. home prices are 33% below their 2006 peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cash buyers are especially prevalent in markets where prices have fallen the most, often areas hard hit by foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Las Vegas, the foreclosure capitol of the U.S. for the past four years, cash buyers accounted for 49% of first-quarter sales vs. 20% in the first quarter of 1997, says data from real estate site <span class="companylink">Zillow.com</span>. In that area, home prices are almost 60% off their 2006 peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Miami-Fort Lauderdale area, 63% of first-quarter buyers paid in cash, vs. 39% in 1997's first quarter, Zillow says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phoenix is also seeing more cash buyers, 44% in the first quarter up from 25% in the same 1997 period, Zillow data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big numbers are "positive news," says Stan Humphries, Zillow chief economist. "These are people who're getting back into the market because they see good value."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cash buyers often get better deals because sellers know their offers won't fall through for lack of financing, says Walt Danley, president of the luxury real estate firm The Walt Danley Group in Arizona. A discount of up to 5% is typical, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Danley sees many foreign buyers paying cash, investors looking for rentals are also big cash buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given low prices, they can buy homes, rent them and be immediately cash-flow positive, says Paul Dales, an economist for Capital Economics.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: Can you characterize where we are in this recovery?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: We're slowly getting better. There's no reason to celebrate if you're a seller. It's a buyer's market, but that's got some opposing facts that make it a good time, such as interest rates that are beyond belief and prices that are, in some cases, down 30%, unless we're talking distressed, in which case prices can be down 40% or 50%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: Why has housing taken so long to recover, and how much supply is on the market?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: Supply in the market really has to be divided to understand where we are. You have a distressed market, which is short sales and foreclosures. Then you have an existing home market that is not a short sale or a foreclosure. Then you have a new home market. So you have three distinct markets. You've got still a load of supply of foreclosure, though it's less than it was. You do not have new home supply at all. New home sales have gone down to 250,000 a year single-family, 300,000 a year on an annualized basis. That's less than a third of a normal year supply for new home sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: Are prices still coming down?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: In some places you see price increases in new homes. At the same time, you see price decreases on short sales and on foreclosures. And that makes sense because some of that has been around for a long enough time for the seller to say, "You know what? I don't care if it's a third, give me my money. Get me out of here."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: How long can rates stay this low?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: I've seen plenty of cycles. And interest rates, since I've been in business, have never been this low. You've got a 10-year Treasury at 3%. You've got mortgage rates for 4% and 5%, a jumbo is 4%, You've got tremendous interest rates. We've got to wait until the Fed stops QE2. When the Fed stops buying bonds, you should see some escalation in interest rates and some drop in the price of bonds because the biggest element of demand is going to leave the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: Do you think we'll see QE3?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: It would be an awful tough one. We have been told of the politics and the deficit focus, so there's no more beer to go around anymore. We can't spend our way any longer out of the problems that we've got without really roughing up the system to an extent that it may become dangerous. I don't see QE3, and I don't see additional stimulus out of the administration being possible. You can't reduce the deficit while starting another program to stimulate the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: But even if we were to see rates back up a little after QE2 ends, you're still looking at a very low level, right? So aren't we talking about low rates for an extended period?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: It very much is determined by items beyond our control. We don't know what's going to happen in the oil market from day to day. The Middle East. We don't know if Greece collapses. If it does, does it take with it Portugal or Ireland or Spain? We don't know what the world holds for us, so I couldn't say that interest rates should stay low. I would have no problem believing that interest rates on 10-year Treasury could go from 3% to 4% to 5% in a space of two years. And if interest rates are 5% on a 10-year, your mortgage is going to be 7% or 7%. We existed for 40 years with an average interest rate for mortgages at 8% and thought we were doing pretty well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: How hard is it to get a mortgage right now? Are banks lending?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: Well, if you really don't need the loan, you can get it in a minute. If you've got decent credit and you're going for an 80% mortgage, there's no problem whatsoever. People will chase you all over town trying to get that to you. If you're looking for an all- pay as opposed to prime, you're going to have a little more difficulty. Anything other than prime or alt-A (the next riskiest) mortgage, yes, it's difficult. But that's not what's restraining the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: What is restraining the market, then?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: It's fear, a lack of confidence in home prices. You've got an awful lot of talk in the media, discussing whether house prices are going to go down another 5%, 10%, 15% or 20%. I think time heals all. And we believe that down the road, we are going to go back into what was a normal housing market for a long, long time in the U.S., which is that housing goes up in value every couple of years. We're not helped by discussions out of Washington that we ought to consider putting the GSEs (government sponsored enterprises) out of business, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>; we ought to consider lessening the mortgage deduction. It doesn't matter whether you do put the GSEs out of business, and it doesn't matter if you do take away some of the mortgage interest rate deduction, as long as you give us a static situation where people know what the rules of the game are. Right now, people are confused.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: Can you walk us through the country and tell us where the strong spots are for housing and where there still are troubled spots?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: Oh, sure. Trouble spots for housing are Vegas; Phoenix; for more expensive housing, Chicago; inland empire in California; Georgia, Atlanta. Better markets are Massachusetts down through Washington, D.C.; Raleigh; Charlotte; Texas, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio. Austin's a little rough. I think that's about it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q: If housing stays stagnant, will the rest of the economy stagnate or even worsen?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A: The answer is yes, yes, yes. It's housing that took us into the mess that we got into. Mortgages became available if you could wear a tie and chew gum. And they were securitized. And everyone was doing it. Well, how's a guy ever going to pay it off? People said he doesn't have to pay it off. Everybody knows houses are going up 10% a year. In five years, it'll be 50% paid off just on the basis of appreciation. Oh, OK. What are my people going to do with the extra money? That's easy, buy a bigger house. Everybody's happy. And if the price goes up more and more, that creates even greater demand. And it's the age-old snowball that's been going on for the last 3,000 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So there you are with a market that finally collapses, and it employs probably more than any other industry in the U.S. Until housing gets back up to a level of production that puts enough people to work so that it's clear that our job market is going in the right direction, you're going to have what Jimmy Carter called the malaise.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CLEVELAND -- Signs of desolation are everywhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stands are closed. Sections are abandoned. Occupants have fled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Can you believe this?" Mark Kissinger, 53, a Cleveland-area computer businessman and Indians fan since birth, said during Tuesday's first-place showdown game against the Kansas City Royals at Progressive Field that drew 9,650 fans. "The stadium is starting to look like the city. I hate to say it, but I think we're back to the way things were in the '70s and '80s around here. Pretty depressing."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Indians, whose rejuvenation more than a decade ago symbolized this city's economic renaissance, now are one of four teams in the Rust Belt -- the USA's manufacturing heartland -- with a wary eye on their shrinking populations and battered job markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Detroit (25%), Cleveland (17%), Cincinnati (10.4%) and Pittsburgh (8.6%) suffered the largest population declines among the 28 Major League Baseball cities in the 2010 Census. All rank in the top eight for population loss nationwide. Now, they are searching for ways to reunite with their fan base -- or at least retain what remains -- while enduring the nation's worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have to reinvent ourselves as a business and look at ourselves differently," says Indians President Mark Shapiro, whose team's season-ticket base has gone from 27,000 fans at its peak from 1995 to 1998 to about 7,700 today. "We can't just seek to attract the same fans, because there's less of them. We have to get some new people in the stands here. Really, we have no choice."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Indians and Pirates rank 30th and 27th, respectively, in major league attendance this season, their slight average downturns mirroring MLB's 2% overall decline through Wednesday's games. But their fan base was fallow to begin with, and they, along with the Tigers and Reds, must confront a future in markets where fans' spending power, as well as their spirit and optimism, might be diminishing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">USA TODAY spent eight days in the four shrinking cities, examining the enormous challenges that lay ahead for these teams and their plans for viability in the face of population loss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cleveland</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Indians, who made no significant improvements to a team that finished fourth in the American League Central in 2010, surprisingly are in first place in the division with a 15-8 record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city has yet to notice, it appears. The Indians are averaging a paid attendance of 13,536. They've already had their six smallest crowds in their stadium's 18-year history this season, drawing more than 11,000 fans twice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm a fair-weather Indians fan," says Jermaine Ingram, one of three people standing at the ticket window one recent afternoon. "I think everybody's still kind of skeptical."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not the same juggernaut that mowed down the American League Central year after year, drawing 455 consecutive sellouts at then-Jacobs Field from 1995 to 2001. The sustained winning stopped in 2002 with their first losing season in nine years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The off-field losses were more profound for the city's future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three Fortune 500 companies departed. Jobs dried up. The population declined so dramatically that 396,815 residents, down from 900,000 in 1950, remain, the lowest total since 1900.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Flats, the neighborhood that drove Cleveland's revival and whose trendy nightspots flourished with the Indians in the late 1990s, now is littered with abandoned buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly one in every four Cleveland homes, according to the 2010 Census, are vacant or no longer exist. Most of the abandonment is on the east side, where vacancy rates have soared by 65%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's never going to be like it was in the '90s," says Indians coach Sandy Alomar, their former six-time All-Star catcher. "You look at the market values. The home values. There's no jobs."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Indians have tried to respond. They've slashed seat prices in the bleachers from $20 to $10 and in the upper-deck seats behind home plate from $16 to $8. The decline has left the Indians with a gorgeous stadium and 130 luxury suites and not that many people to fill them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The deterioration that has taken place is shocking," says former Indians pitcher Brian Anderson, a Cleveland-area native. "I love it there. But if you're a kid and go to college, unless you're in the medical field, why are you going to stick around?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Look at what happened to The Flats. That was the place you wanted to go to have a good time. Now it's a place you go if you want to get shot."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One bar was open Tuesday night after the Indians' game. The lone parking lot with activity was Christie's Cabaret, a strip club.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"So many jobs have been lost," Shapiro says. "The executives we don't have aren't buying our luxury seats. The middle management we don't have aren't buying season tickets. The workers we don't have aren't buying walkup and bleacher seats."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Architects are designing ways to reduce the number of suites, and the club plans concerts and winter sports events.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've got to find other ways to get people into the ballpark, because the ballpark is our greatest asset," Shapiro says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Detroit</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Malek Ameating, a Detroit native for 19 years, sits four hours in his cab outside a downtown hotel, waiting for a fare. This is his second year on the job, after he was laid off at <span class="companylink">Ford Motor Co</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Look at this city," he says. "The city is so dead."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No major league city has been slammed harder than Detroit. Its population of 713,000 in last year's Census was the lowest it had been since 1910. Unemployment is at 11.3%; the national average is 8.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Downtown streets are desolate. Burned-out and vacated buildings are on virtually every block. A chain-link fence now protects the property of old Tiger Stadium, with the flagpole the only sign baseball was even played at the corner of Michigan and Trumbull.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's not even enough money to burn down the buildings," says Wayne State professor Jim Puklin, who lives in the same complex where civil rights activist Rosa Parks once resided. "There's no grocery stores. No department stores. I've got to go to the suburbs for everything."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Tigers largely have flourished in 12-year-old Comerica Park despite the decline and decay around them, setting a franchise record by averaging more than 30,000 fans a game the last five years, including two seasons of at least 3 million fans. They are drawing 25,113 fans this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's a passion here that's unbelievable," Tigers manager Jim Leyland says. "I told these guys, 'This is not the time not to be running to first base.' People are starving and losing their jobs. They're paying their hard-earned money to come."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Says Brandon Inge, the only Tigers player who lives full time in Michigan: "It's amazing people show up like they do. People thank me all of the time just for living here."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last Friday night, amid 41-degree temperatures and misting rain, there was a paid attendance of 23,537. The Tigers have more than 12,000 seats priced at $16 or less, including season-ticket packages starting at $10 a game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The city and state are going through tough economic times, but we're coming out of it," Tigers President Dave Dombrowski says. "We draw from all over. It's absolutely amazing the support we have here. The auto industry will never be the same. But it's coming back. And if it comes back, a lot of other businesses will come back."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It indeed might be on its way. Ford announced a $2.6 billion profit Wednesday, its best first quarter in 13 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, it will take time. And the state beyond Detroit has seen attrition; Toledo -- 60 miles away -- ranks ninth in the nation in 2010 Census population drop (8%).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are 79,725 vacant homes in the city, according to Census data, a staggering 22.8% of the total. In Wayne County, which encompasses Detroit, the business vacancy rate is 62.2%. The next worst is Cleveland with a 35.1% business vacancy rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The people there are very resilient," says Kirk Gibson, the World Series MVP for the 1984 Tigers. "They'll be back."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pittsburgh</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's a woman buying ice cream at the Dipping Dots station in the late innings on Easter Sunday at PNC Park. Another man is buying nachos at the North Shore concession stand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are 12 concession stands lined up around the lower concourse that are empty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pittsburgh attorney Brendan Delaney, one of 5,986 fans who walked through the turnstiles to watch the Pirates play the Washington Nationals, says, "It's easy to be a fan when you're winning."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They haven't had a winning season since 1992, the longest drought by any major franchise in North American history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Pirates' attendance is the worst in the National League. The Pirates, who christened PNC Park in 2001, have drawn less than 10,000 in three of their last five games.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After losing at least 94 games in six consecutive seasons, including 105 last year, the Pirates blame themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If we ever finish at .500, they'll throw a parade," Delaney says. "The big joke is that people have kids in college who have never seen a winning season."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Pirates used to be one of the crown jewels of baseball," says manager Clint Hurdle, who has an ornament hanging on his office doorknob that reads, Out of challenges, grow miracles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We need to revisit greatness again. We need to re-bond with the city. We lost a lot of fans. They're tired and worn out."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, despite the 8.6% population decline, Pittsburgh's economy is turning, thanks to its health care and service industries and universities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Pittsburgh is actually in pretty decent shape," says former Texas Rangers CEO Chuck Greenberg, whose family has lived in the area for five generations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A lot of the challenges that Cleveland and Detroit are facing now, Pittsburgh had to confront in the '80s. Pittsburgh lost their coal industry a lot more quickly than the other Rust Belt cities did.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"So even though the city has gone through very difficult times, it helped Pittsburgh position itself easier than most."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pirates President Frank Coonelly says the city's resurgence can be an inspiration to their own comeback. "The city and the region have done a remarkable job transforming from an industrial city to an economy that continues to thrive on financial health care, high- tech and advance manufacturing," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There remains a very strong corporate base here. The population isn't what it once was, but Pittsburgh never really enjoyed the bubble of increased home prices -- and certainly not a population growth. So it hasn't suffered the burst of a bubble."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Pirates' season-ticket sales are up 10% over a year ago, Coonelly says, to more than 7,000. Their pre-sales also are ahead by 10% over last year, when they sold 1.6 million tickets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Says Greenberg: "Very deep in the DNA of Pittsburghers is their love of baseball. Everybody just needs to have hope again."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cincinnati</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cincinnati's downtown streets, with boarded-up buildings, are filled with signs that read: "Retail Space Available," and "Office Space Available." But the morning air is filled with the sound of heavy-lifting cranes, dump trucks and jackhammers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cincinnati, a city of 296,243, saw its unemployment rate fall to 9.7% from 10.9% a year ago. New jobs are coming with the development of the Banks, a 24-hour urban neighborhood along the city's riverfront. There will be offices, restaurants, clubs, retail shops and homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This should all help make the Reds more of a destination," says local businessman Bob Crotty, a season ticketholder for baseball's oldest franchise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But prosperity has been elusive for the Reds since their 1970s glory days with the Big Red Machine. They won the pennant four times in seven years and remain the last NL team to win back-to-back World Series titles, in 1975 and '76.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet their greatness perhaps casts a shadow on the current Reds. The Reds won the NL Central last year for the first time in 15 years, but they drew only 2.06 million fans. The day they clinched the division, they drew 30,151 at Great American Ball Park, which opened in 2003. The next day, 14,760 arrived. This year, over the last three homestands, the Reds had eight crowds of less than 20,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Probably a lot has to do with the economic climate," manager Dusty Baker says. "We're a tri-state team. People have to drive to come see us. It's tough when the price of gas is so high."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Reds, whose fan base covers about a 150-mile radius in four states, also could be hurting from population drops in neighboring cities. Dayton, 54 miles from Cincinnati, lost 15% of its population, the nation's fifth-largest decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Reds average 22,512 fans a game but expected more. They sold about 3,000 more season tickets than a year ago, increasing their ticket base to about 11,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The economy is so much different now," says Phil Castellini, Reds chief operating officer. "But we think if we can have sustained winning, we can slowly rebuild the base."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But they still must fight external factors. Cincinnati had a 7.3% drop in home sales in March, with the median price falling more than 19% to $98,000. Hamilton County, which encompasses Cincinnati, lost $5 billion in value in the past year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I know the economy was hurting last year, but people are surprised they're not drawing better," says New York Yankees scout Tim Naehring, whose family grew up in Cincinnati. "It's still a great team. This is a hardworking German town, and the fans here are very loyal. It's just that here, everything moves a little slower."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More people bought new homes in March, giving the battered industry a small lift after the worst winter for sales in almost a half-century.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales rose 11% last month from February to a seasonally adjusted rate of 300,000 homes, the Commerce Department said Monday. That follows three-straight monthly declines. Still, the pace remains far below the 700,000 homes a year that economists view as healthy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes fell last year for the fifth-consecutive year, and the market is showing no signs of rebounding. Economists say it could take years before sales return to a healthy pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of new homes sold rose nearly 3% from February to $213,800. New-home prices are about 34% higher than the median price for resales. That's more than twice the difference in healthy housing markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders are struggling to compete with a record number of foreclosures, which have forced down the price of resales and made them more of a bargain. The disparity has dragged on the economy. New homes represent a fraction of sales, but they have an outsize impact on the broader economy. Each new home creates an average of three jobs for a year and $90,000 in taxes, according to the National Association of Home Builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"New housing prices look much less attractive compared to cheap existing stock," said Yelena Shulyatyeva, an analyst with <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas</span>. "As such, new housing demand will likely remain depressed throughout this year and next."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many builders are waiting for the glut of foreclosures and other distressed properties to be cleared before stepping up construction. But with 1.2 million foreclosures forecast this year nationwide, according to foreclosure tracker RealtyTrac, a turnaround isn't expected for years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You can't put lipstick on this pig," said Diane Swonk, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Mesirow Financial</span>. "The new housing market remains weak no matter how the data is cut."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High unemployment, tight credit and a lingering fear that prices will fall further have kept people from making home purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seasonally adjusted number of new homes for sale in the United States is the fewest since the summer of 1967, when there were 110 million fewer people in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Requests for building permits, a gauge of future construction, sank in the winter to the lowest level in more than 50 years. They recovered somewhat in March, but that improvement was spurred by a more than 28% jump in permits for apartment and condo buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales rose in most regions of the country last month. Sales jumped nearly 67% in the Northeast, which was hit hard by wintry weather; by almost 26% in the West, which saw a surge in buying three months ago because of a Jan. 1 deadline for a California state tax credit; and by nearly 13% in the Midwest. Sales fell 0.6% in the South, which accounts for the nation's biggest home- sale market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the pace of new-home sales, it would take more than seven months to clear them off the market. Economists say a six-month supply of homes is healthy.</p>

<div>466 words</div><div>21 April 2011</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.1</div><div>English</div><div>© 2011 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes rose slightly in March but prices fell as the U.S. housing market continues to struggle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales rose 3.7% from February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.1 million, the National Association of Realtors reported Wednesday. That marked the sixth monthly rise for existing home sales in the past eight months. "We're clearly on a recovery path," says Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet median prices in March dropped 5.9% from March 2010 to $159,600. Distressed homes accounted for 40% of sales, up from 35% a year ago, the NAR says. Distressed homes, such as those in foreclosure, typically sell at a 20% discount and pull down market prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At this point, we're likely to see a steady improvement in sales," says economist Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors. But prices will continue to come under pressure because of so many distressed homes. Many economists expect U.S. home prices to fall 5% to 7% this year. Some economists predict steeper declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, investors are driving much of the increase in existing home sales. They're snapping up distressed homes, fixing them up and selling them for a slight profit, or turning them into rentals, says Patrick Newport, economist at IHS Global Insight. Investors accounted for 22% of sales activity in March, the NAR says, up from 19% a year ago. Thirty-five percent of March sales were all-cash deals, a record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors are seizing on low prices and strong rental demand, says Paul Dales, U.S. economist at Capital Economics. Rents have edged up in recent months after staying fairly stable for two years, he says. There are also more renters after millions of people lost homes to foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are signs that non-investor buyers are getting more active. Applications for mortgages to buy homes, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's Purchases index, have risen 10% over a seven- week period, Newport says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This pickup in demand should show up in improved existing home sales in April and May, unless lending conditions tighten," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tight credit is already restraining demand, Yun says. The NAR says the average credit score for loans bought by government-backed mortgage giants <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> and <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> is now about 760, up from 720 in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High unemployment and underwater mortgages are also hurting demand. Almost 25% of homeowners with a mortgage owe more than their homes are worth. "This means many households that want to move can't," Dales says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales may rise this year, but "a meaningful recovery is a few years away," he says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The once-dismal commercial real estate market is turning around far more quickly than analysts expected, with troubled loans falling, occupancy rising and office building sales surging in the largest markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's welcome news for an economic recovery that still faces headwinds such as rising oil prices. The improving market has eased fears that banks might be crippled by heavy losses from their bad construction loans in the mid-2000s and would have to rein in lending just as credit is easing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders were still saddled with $181 billion in distressed loans in February, according to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span> (RCA). But that's down from $188 billion in September. Mortgage defaults for office, retail and industrial building loans dipped for the first time since 2005 in the fourth quarter, to 4.28% from 4.36%. They should fall further this year, says RCA economist Sam Chandan. "Worst-case scenarios have been avoided," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recovery, he says, has finally stabilized building occupancy, letting landlords pay down loans. Vacancy rates in the first quarter dipped slightly for retail and industrial properties, to 7.2% and 10%, respectively, and were unchanged at 13.4% for offices, according to CoStar Group. Occupancy has edged up steadily since early last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors, meanwhile, are clamoring to buy well-leased office buildings in markets such as New York City and Washington, D.C. A big reason: virtually no new development the past few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York, "We're seeing prices (for prized buildings) return to 2007 levels" after falling 40% in the downturn, says Richard Baxter, vice chairman of real estate giant <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York's biggest office landlord, <span class="companylink">SL Green Realty</span>, has been scooping up buildings. Co-Chief Investment Officer Isaac Zion says credit is available, occupancy and lease rates are up and returns far exceed meager bond yields. "We really saw the writing on the wall and we pounced," Zion says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commercial mortgage-backed securities, a big funding source for some buyers, are up this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More foreclosures are still likely to batter prices in many areas. But the investment furor could spread to cities such as Dallas, Denver and Houston, says CoStar real estate strategist Chris Macke.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising prices could at least temper foreclosures on the $1.4 trillion in commercial mortgages that <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> says are maturing by 2013. Even owners still making payments might not be able to refinance properties whose values fell sharply.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing market looks like a scorched landscape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, home prices are down almost 32% from their 2006 peak. Many economists expect them to fall at least 5% more this year. Some predict even steeper declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if home prices bottom later this year -- a big "if" for many markets -- they're not likely to rise much for several years, forecasters predict.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It'll take a long time for markets to recover," says Paul Dales, economist at Capital Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's because millions of homes still face foreclosure. Lending standards are tight. Almost one-quarter of homeowners with mortgages are underwater, which means it will be tough for them to move up into nicer homes because they owe more than their current house is worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, even charred terrain sprouts green shoots eventually. And some areas have laid the groundwork for better days, according to an analysis for USA TODAY by real estate website <span class="companylink">Zillow.com</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the nation's 100 largest metropolitan areas, Zillow identified six -- Las Vegas; Fort Myers, Fla.; Stockton and Vallejo, Calif.; Hartford, Conn.; and Columbus, Ohio -- that show best what housing markets look like when they are bottoming out but not yet in recovery mode. To identify them, Zillow considered factors such as the trajectory of home prices, housing affordability based on a ratio of prices to local incomes, and foreclosure rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of the six is seeing price gains, just lessening declines that are expected to continue. Their foreclosure rates have peaked, so the worst could be behind them. Homes in these markets also are becoming more affordable, relative to local incomes, than they were before the real estate boom and bust of the past decade. Investors in many of the markets say the housing deals won't get much better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In these markets, you can kind of see a light at the end of the tunnel, and it's been a pretty long, dark tunnel," says Stan Humphries, <span class="companylink">Zillow.com</span> chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Las Vegas</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flat: The new up</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors are betting that the home market here has bottomed -- or is about to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daniel Callihan, 57, a former mortgage company officer, sees that when he hits foreclosure auctions held in a parking lot near downtown. There are twice as many bidders as a year ago, Callihan says. He's bought and sold 10 Las Vegas homes in the past two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many Las Vegas investors are paying cash. In February, more than half of southern Nevada's existing homes were bought with cash, local agents say. Investors also are turning many homes into rentals, says Paul Bell, president of the Greater Las Vegas Association of Realtors. No wonder: Homes that sell for $60,000 can fetch $800 a month in rent -- an investment return almost three times the rate in Manhattan or Los Angeles, says Patrick ONeill, CEO of ONeill Group, which is buying Las Vegas homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before softening in recent months, Las Vegas home prices had been largely flat for more than a year. "Flat, for us right now, is very good," Bell says. Whether prices will stay flat is another matter. <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics doesn't expect Las Vegas single-family-home prices to bottom until mid-2012. One problem: The city still has thousands of homes headed to foreclosure, says University of Las Vegas economist Stephen Brown. He says it will take at least three years for the market to absorb the excess homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the only sure bet in Vegas? That its housing bottom "will be a long one," Brown says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vallejo, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bruised but with 'good bones'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Realtor Ramon Torres has a front-row seat on the housing wreckage in this San Francisco suburb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seated next to a living room window during one of his recent open houses, he saw just one couple coming up the steps in the first hour. They stayed less than five minutes, apparently underwhelmed by the $269,000 five-bedroom house with streaked windows and chipped paint. The owner, who owes $470,000 on the house, wants a short sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sixteen similar homes are for sale within a 1-mile radius, and Torres fears that the "worst is yet to come" for Vallejo as more homes are lost to foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, one in 16 homes here received a foreclosure filing, the nation's 10th-highest rate, RealtyTrac says. Torres also fears that Vallejo's reputation will scare off home buyers, given that the city declared bankruptcy in 2008 and has made deep cuts in city services, including police and fire personnel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Vallejo, along with Stockton, Las Vegas and Fort Myers, also was hit early and hard by the national housing bust and will be one of the first to recover, Zillow says. Last year, Vallejo's foreclosure filings dropped 12%, while they edged up nationwide almost 2%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today's Vallejo buyers are mostly investors who can get good rent for some of the lowest-cost housing in the San Francisco Bay Area, real estate agents say. "There's a very strong investor presence," says David Tipp, owner of Tipp Realty at Glen Cove.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jay Boberg, 52, a Los Angeles-based investor, has bought four Vallejo properties in the past two years. He's rented them all and immediately went cash-flow positive. He sees Vallejo as a city with "good bones," including a waterfront, views of the San Francisco Bay and proximity to San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The fact that you can rent an apartment or a house here, with a view of the (San Francisco) Bay, for $800 to $1,300 a month is incredible," Boberg says. "I can't believe real estate here won't be worth much more in 15 years."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Columbus, Ohio</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Getting in young and cheap</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time home buyers are having a hard time in today's market, given tight lending standards and competition from all-cash buyers. In February, 34% of existing-home buyers were first-timers, a National Association of Realtors survey says. In a healthy market, that would be 40%, the NAR says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Columbus and the five other markets Zillow analyzed for USA TODAY have become so affordable that people who didn't think they could afford to own are finding that they can. Lisa Lee, a 25-year- old business analyst, recently bought a $60,000 three-bedroom home in a suburb here that had gone through foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her monthly mortgage, including insurance and property taxes, will run about $140 less per month than the rent she paid on her two-bedroom apartment. She secured an FHA-backed loan. Her down payment and closing costs came to about $2,900.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I couldn't believe the house was so cheap," Lee says. "Why keep wasting money on rent?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Columbus is also getting a little boost from consumers with stable finances who put off buying homes during the recession, says real estate market analyst Robert Vogt of Vogt Santer Insights. Given signs of a national recovery, people are "getting the confidence to move," Vogt says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fort Myers, Fla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New values 'wow' buyers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ray Bayer, 59, of Pittsburgh has long planned to retire in Florida, but prices were too high. In January, the postal worker finally bought a $255,000 Fort Myers home that he says would have fetched $400,000 at the market's peak. Bayer and his wife, Kathy, 57, a nurse, expect to retire to it in a few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fort Myers, like much of Florida, has been battered by foreclosures. In 2010, one in 12 Fort Myers homes had foreclosure filings, the nation's second-highest rate after Las Vegas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, Fort Myers' foreclosure pace last year was down 28% from 2009. And recently, banks have slowed the pace at which they put homes on the market. That's driving multiple offers and buyers who have to settle "for their third or fourth choice," says broker Terri Lodge of Century 21 Sunbelt Realty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In February, the number of single-family homes for sale in Fort Myers was down 52% from the same month in 2009 and sales were up 2.4%, says Bob Groves, managing broker of <span class="companylink">Coldwell Banker Residential Real Estate</span>. Snowbirds and retirees are fueling much of the activity, Realtors say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They've seen the deals and said, 'Wow,' " says Rob Keller, a Coldwell Banker agent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hartford, Conn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jobs to help</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adam and Clare Baroncelli have been on the open-house circuit for several months and have seen good homes get snapped up more quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increased activity drove them off the fence. They have made an offer on a $370,000, four-bedroom home in Simsbury, near Hartford. "There's a lot more activity," says Clare, 34.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Baroncellis moved in August from Florida to Connecticut because of Adam's job change. Job growth is expected to help the Hartford region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the four major labor markets in the state, Hartford has the best prospects for job growth, says Steven Lanza, editor of The Connecticut Economy, the University of Connecticut's economic publication. Late last year, just 12% of homeowners with mortgages in the Hartford region owed more on their homes than they were worth, Zillow data show. That's far better than the national average, then 27%. Fewer underwater homeowners means there are more homeowners who can move up into more expensive homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rob Giuffria, president of Prudential Premier Homes in Farmington, Conn., says there are huge differences among Hartford areas in terms of the current housing market. Some upper-scale neighborhoods -- fueled by white-collar workers and executives -- may be bottoming, while some inner-city areas are worsening, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lanza looks for a broader "recovery" soon. As with the other markets Zillow analyzed, that doesn't necessarily mean improvement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It means you're not getting worse and maybe you're getting better," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stockton, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pain and opportunity</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few areas have been through a longer and darker tunnel than this central California city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since peaking in 2006, Stockton's median home price is down 62%. For three of the past four years, Stockton ranked in the top five nationwide for foreclosures, says market researcher RealtyTrac. In January, six of 10 homes for sale in the city either were bank- owned, in foreclosure or tied to a delinquent mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet there are glimmers of change. Last year, Stockton dropped to No. 7 in foreclosures nationwide. Local Realtors say there are more non-distressed homes for sale now than there were a few years ago. More low-ball offers are being refused. And multiple offers are common on lower-end homes. "It's a very competitive market," says Jerry Abbott of Grupe Real Estate in Stockton. He recently got six offers for one home priced at $121,000, a short sale in which the lender agrees to sell a property for less than is owed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big concern is when banks will begin to list for sale more of the distressed homes they've kept off the market, which could hurt prices. Banks slowed their foreclosure processes last fall after a public outcry over thousands of improperly documented foreclosure cases. The other issue is when Stockton will regain jobs. The unemployment rate in the local county -- 17.6% in February -- is one of the nation's highest. <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics predicts Stockton-area home prices won't return to their 2006 peak for more than 20 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some people say it's time to buy, including Cary Fopiano, 41. Since 1996, she and her husband, Steve, 50, have made money on two of the Stockton homes they've owned. They lost money on one but are still far ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stay-at-home mom and manufacturing manager bought their fourth home last year, on a lake in an upscale neighborhood. They're shopping for another to turn into a rental investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Prices are about as low as they can go," Fopiano says.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. housing market's condition continues to worsen, heightening expectations of a double-dip housing recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home prices dropped in January, and the average retreated to summer 2003 levels, the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case-Shiller home-price indexes show. Its 20-city composite index shows prices down 3.1% from January 2010 levels, S&amp;P says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The housing market recession is not yet over, and none of the statistics are indicating any form of sustained recovery," says David Blitzer, of S&amp;P.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report follows other recent dire housing news: New home sales plunged in February to a record low. February housing starts were almost as bad. And existing home sales were down 3% for the month from the year before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We had expected the housing market to show somewhat better numbers by now. Things are much weaker than we anticipated," says Patrick Newport, chief economist with IHS Global Insight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While he still expects better numbers in the next quarter of this year, Newport says they now "won't be as good as earlier hoped."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Capital Economics also now expects home prices to drop more than it had thought last summer. Prices may stabilize next year, says Paul Dales, the firm's U.S. economist. "There won't be much of a housing recovery this year, at all," Dales says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Historically, housing has led the U.S. economy out of recessions. Now, falling home prices are one of the leading risks to the economy, after higher oil prices, says Mark Zandi, economist with <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the housing statistics are "bad," he says the sector's performance is "roughly sticking to script." He still expects prices to bottom later this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">S&amp;P says a double dip will occur when home prices in its 10- and 20-city composites set new post-peak lows. Compared with their April 2009 lows, the 10-city composite is still 2.8% higher and the 20- city composite is up 1.1%. But both have moved closer to a confirmed double dip for six consecutive months, S&amp;P says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As prices fall, more homeowners go underwater on their mortgages, meaning they owe more than their homes are worth. That increases the chance that those homes will go into foreclosure, which can drag prices lower. As homeowners lose equity, they may also curb spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dales says a double dip in housing won't be enough to derail the national economy's recovery, but it will restrain its strength, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Atlanta, Cleveland, Detroit and Las Vegas, January home prices were lower than in 2000, the Case-Shiller index shows. Washington, D.C., and San Diego were the only two index markets where prices rose year over year. Washington's prices were up 3.6%, and San Diego's rose 0.1%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national spring home buying season is off to a bleak start, fueling worries that the U.S. housing market may not hit bottom this year or will do so later than expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes in February plunged to their slowest pace on record, the Commerce Department said Wednesday, and median prices dropped to the lowest level since December 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing single-family homes were also dismal in February, with volume down 3% from a year ago and median prices down 5.2%, the National Association of Realtors said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The statistics portray a housing market that's in a "very precarious situation," said Chris Christopher, economist at IHS Global Insight. His firm still expects the market to bottom this year, but, "Things are being delayed a little bit more than we thought," Christopher says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market may slide into another downturn, a "double dip," after slow improvement, says Diane Swonk, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Mesirow Financial</span>. She expects it to regain momentum later this year. But in a report Wednesday she said, "Even that forecast may be optimistic."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New and existing home sales were boosted last year by federal tax credits. With those gone, both sectors are struggling to gain traction. Last month, sales of new homes fell 16.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 250,000. Median prices fell almost 14% from January, the Commerce Department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bad weather hurt sales, as did unemployment and other economic concerns. "This is a consumer that continues to be uncertain about the future," says David Crowe, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some buyers are being stymied by tightened lending standards. Eight of 10 buyers who look at new homes for sale by Caresco Homes in Stockton, Calif., don't qualify for loans, often because they lost homes to foreclosure or short sale, says sales manager Gina Carruesco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IHS expects sales of new homes to edge up to 350,000 this year, from 320,000 last year, and for sales of existing homes to hit 5.1 million, from 4.9 million last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some markets are off to a stronger start. In Hanover, N.H., the 26 agents in the Coldwell Banker Redpath &amp; Co. office have closed 52 home sales this year, up from 41 at the same time last year, says owner Ned Redpath. "I'm holding my breath," he says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, the owners of the <span class="companylink">Ritz-Carlton</span> resort on the outskirts of Las Vegas shut down the Mediterranean-style property in a bid to cut losses as travelers avoided pricey hotels and investor anxiety grew.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, the resort reopened with a smaller staff, fewer amenities and services, and cheaper prices. Guests can now pay as little as $140 for a night in the same bed that was previously $300.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Ritz-Carlton</span>'s downgrade of what's now called the Ravella at Lake Las Vegas is just an example of how the hotel industry hopes to climb out of its biggest slump in recent history as Americans, especially business travelers, are returning to the road amid optimism about the USA's economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hotel companies also are renovating their properties after years of delaying makeovers. They're investing in boutique hotels and creating new loyalty programs to lure or keep customers. The improvements could even mean that travelers will get better service, because internal studies at some companies, such as <span class="companylink">InterContinental Hotel Group</span>, find hotel employees tend to feel better about where they work when their hotel is updated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time that hotel groups are sprucing up lobbies, beds, TV sets, restaurants, bars and fitness centers, they're also seeking new strategies to one-up rivals. More full-service chains, for instance, are giving free Wi-Fi to more customers, addressing the frequent traveler's biggest pet peeve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The companies are betting that the timing is right to make the investment. More people are returning to the road thanks to improved consumer confidence, renewed interest in making business deals and hiring gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People are tired of not traveling, particularly the business community," says hotel investment banker W. Michael Murphy of First Fidelity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The travel outlook -- barring sustained increases in gasoline and jet fuel prices -- is good enough that <span class="companylink">PricewaterhouseCoopers</span> predicts year-over-year increases in each of the industry's three key measures: occupancy, average daily rate and revenue per available room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's a lot that we should feel confident about," <span class="companylink">Marriott International</span> President Arne Sorenson said at January's Americas Lodging Investment Summit, a key industry meeting in San Diego that typically forecasts the year ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economic rebound is "much faster than we expected around the world," says Hubert Joly, CEO of Carlson, another international hotel group, which is revamping its Radisson brand in the USA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New normal?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite their optimism, hoteliers remain nervous about how much they can push up what they charge for a room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers have gotten used to finding cheap rates -- especially at luxury hotels -- on Priceline and other discount travel websites. And this year, coupon website Groupon and copycats have seen business skyrocket, partly thanks to hotels' eagerness to fill rooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this month, for instance, the <span class="companylink">LivingSocial</span> coupon site offered a one-night stay at New York City's new ultraluxury Setai Fifth Avenue hotel for $289, 45% less than its $525 introductory rate last fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Larger hotel owners are also putting rooms on sale for this summer. Sage Hospitality, which operates 39 hotels, ran an unusual 48-hour sale this month. The sale lets customers slash 50% off summer-time rates at the company's Marriott Courtyard, Hilton Garden Inn, Sheraton, Renaissance and other hotels as long as they pay in advance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discounts underscore how confidence still varies in the industry's recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael DeNicola, chief investment officer of FelCor Lodging Trust, one of the USA's biggest hotel real-estate investment trusts, says some of FelCor's hotels are in "areas that aren't seeing strong comebacks yet." He lists Arizona and California among the weaker markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, most industry leaders agree it's a matter of time before rates soar and travelers pay more because hotels are nearly as full as before the peak year, 2008. Evidence that room prices soon will rise: Big chains last fall successfully negotiated rate increases in their 2011 corporate contracts, a first step toward raising prices for other customers, Marriott's Sorenson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starwood CEO Frits van Paasschen says the high-end meetings that companies stopped during the recession are returning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"December looks like it was a big booking month for group business," he said at January's lodging summit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Increasing demand for rooms by business travelers, vacationers and group business isn't enough to push rates higher by itself. But another factor may: a looming shortage of rooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The industry is seeing a dramatic decline in the number of new hotels ready to open or in the planning stages. In 2011 and 2012 combined, just 933 newly built hotels are scheduled to open -- nearly 30% fewer than in the last peak year of 2008 (1,341 hotels ), according to hotel construction tracker Lodging Econometrics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There isn't going to be any new capacity added in the next two, three years," van Paasschen says. "If you're a hotel company, this is actually very good news. There will be growing demand, and people go out and travel more, and there won't be enough hotels for people to stay in."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction financing for new hotels vanished when the financial markets crashed after the collapse of <span class="companylink">Lehman Bros</span>. in September 2008. Most of the hotels that have opened since had financing in place before Lehman's collapse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That could be starting to change. In the last six months, however, Charles Quinn of CBRE Hotels, says he's seen hints of a rebound among well-qualified buyers in top cities. A Hyatt being built in Midtown Manhattan, for instance, was able to get construction financing, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slowdown in hotel openings is expected to last several years, though. Lodging Econometrics' figures also show that last year developers initiated only 422 new hotels -- the smallest number in more than a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pleasant results coming</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Travelers can expect to see some pleasant results after three years of hotel penny-pinching that meant worn furniture, hotel staff layoffs and no free water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People are willing to reinvest in our hotels, do upgrades, and finally get around to installing flat-screen TVs," says Jim Anhut, a senior executive at <span class="companylink">InterContinental Hotels</span> Group, which runs chains such as Holiday Inn, Crowne Plaza and Hotel Indigo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hotel sales, a likely outgrowth of an improved market, will spur more renovations, says CBRE Hotels chief Kevin Mallory. That's because sale contracts always contain a provision requiring the new owner to upgrade the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When FelCor closed on its purchase of the iconic Fairmont Copley Plaza in Boston last fall, for instance, the company immediately initiated a massive upgrade. "We're going to put some money into the hotel that will make it a better hotel," DeNicola says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As business picks up, hotels get busier, start to hire and show off redone interiors, travelers should also benefit from a harder- to-measure effect: higher employee morale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Are you happier to work in a dreary space that the owner hasn't invested any capital in the last five years, or are you happier in a space that's bright and cheery, and you hear the customer saying, 'How nice?'" Anhut says. "Employees are feeling good about that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Feeling</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boutique hotels that defy the cookie-cutter formula expect another big year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite being around since the early 1980s, boutiques have become a hot trend among hoteliers because they let today's iPhone-using, playlist-making, <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span>-drinking travelers feel at home. They eschew predictability in favor of helping people feel special through design, music, art, fashion, cuisine and even gourmet coffee and hand-made cocktails.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the trend is hot, travelers should expect to see more developers transform old hotels, warehouses and office buildings into upscale boutique hotels -- especially in big cities such as New York, Miami and Chicago. Boutique hotel pioneer Ian Schrager this fall plans to re-open Chicago's iconic Ambassador East as a hip hotel that gives guests complimentary Wi-Fi.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big chains this year more than ever are trying to embrace a boutique feel, adopting a hip attitude, love of music and fresh design. Marriott, which grew into a global powerhouse by offering predictability, is trying to rebrand its Renaissance hotels into a hip chain that stands for cool music and memorable design. At InterContinental, parent of the Holiday Inn chain, the 5-year-old, boutique-style Hotel Indigo chain will grow from 38 to 48 by the end of this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hotel companies are getting more aggressive about capturing customers, too. Since fall, luxury chains <span class="companylink">Ritz-Carlton</span>, Omni Hotels and Leading Hotels of the World have tweaked their loyalty programs in ways they think will encourage customers to come and return to them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carlson, with its Radisson, Radisson Blu and Country Inns &amp; Suites chains, last month revamped its loyalty program so that frequent customers keep their complimentary Wi-Fi and earn an unusually fast free stay -- after just five paid stays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Travelers, industry analysts say, should hit the road now. Prices, they say, will only go up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The consumer should look at this as a great time to get out and travel, because there is not a lot of hotel development, and as demand rises, rates are going to rise," First Fidelity's Murphy says. Hotels, he says, "are going to be able to raise rates pretty substantially."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ORLANDO -- Beyond the gates of <span class="companylink">Walt Disney</span> World's Magic Kingdom Park, the fairy tale stops abruptly -- with no happily-ever-after ending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreclosure signs dotting once-booming suburban developments that supported decades of growth here and across the rest of the Sun Belt are grim memorials to the recession and housing bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One touch of magic remains: 70-degree days in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The balmy climate -- one of the biggest draws for Florida and other Sun Belt states -- suggests that growth likely will return; the economy will rebound; and millions of vacant homes will be lived in again. But this pause in the boom could be a seminal moment for cities across California, Nevada, Arizona and Florida -- all Sun Belt states that grew fast and have been hardest hit by the housing collapse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Will they allow sprawling housing tracts and gated communities to keep mushrooming in remote suburbs as soon as the crisis ends, or are they rethinking growth the way struggling Rust Belt communities have been forced to?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cities such as Detroit and Buffalo are trying to adjust to economic decline by shrinking smartly -- concentrating development in small pockets and razing abandoned homes to make way for parks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's an extraordinary potential for 'sunburnt' cities to embrace the idea of smart decline" -- doing more with less, whether it's fewer people, fewer home buyers or fewer jobs, says Justin Hollander, urban planning professor at Tufts University and author of Sunburnt Cities, which was published March 1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boomtowns that have been scorched by the housing crisis could learn from struggling Rust Belt communities, Hollander says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sunburnt cities have a chance to limit growth for growth's sake by allowing dense development and reducing parking requirements to encourage walking, public transportation and more green space, Hollander says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In each place there are a lot of opportunities to think smaller," he says. "It hasn't happened yet. Largely, these cities are in denial."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are glimmers, however, of change. The economic slowdown -- coupled with rising energy prices, tight local government budgets and changing demographics -- is prompting new conversations that could lead to a substantial change in the future design of Sun Belt cities, says Armando Carbonell, chairman of the department of planning and urban form at the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, a think tank on land use.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Planners around the country see this as opportunity time," he says. "We'll continue to see a lot of growth, but the form it takes could be different."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Different from the gated housing developments that clump homes on cul-de-sacs and along streets without sidewalks, isolated from shops and services. Planners envision the cities of the future as resembling cities of the past: more high-rise apartments, condos and townhouses near transit stops, shops and businesses on street levels, fewer parking garages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jim Ley, administrator of Florida's Sarasota County, was assistant county manager in Nevada's Clark County (Las Vegas) -- one of the nation's fastest growing throughout much of the past 20 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Communities are at the leading edge of a possible culture change of how we live," Ley says. "It's possible."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back to the city</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In economies driven by housing and construction, the real estate mantra of "location, location, location" has been replaced by "diversification, diversification, diversification."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here in central Florida, medical facilities and research centers are being lured to reduce reliance on tourism and housing. In Arizona and Nevada, the chase is on for technology companies. All three sun-soaked areas are wooing solar-energy companies and other renewable-energy industries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The discussion is going on about changing the engine of growth from real estate speculation and consumer spending to innovation, technology and export," says Robert Lang, urban sociologist at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an area dominated by gaming and tourism, North Las Vegas recently attracted a solar-panel company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Debra March, a city councilwoman and real estate specialist in nearby Henderson, Nev., says it will take at least two more years for the Las Vegas area to absorb all its excess housing inventory. "We have an opportunity here to rethink our whole community strategy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For more than 50 years, central cities lost people to suburbia. That's where people headed when they yearned for a big house and a big yard they could afford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We got what we asked for," Ley says. "Everybody wanted in the name of independence and liberty a little piece of the farm. They got it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, many have lost it. Sun Belt suburbs have the highest percentage of homeowners who owe more on their mortgages than their houses are worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have enough large-lot, single-family homes here on the market today to satisfy demand for years to come," says Phil Laurien, executive director of the East Central Florida Regional Planning Council, which covers six counties from Orange (Orlando) to Volusia (Daytona Beach).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Laurien has seen the suburban flight that caused the decline of many Northern cities the past 50 years, including his native Buffalo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's almost a mirror image," he says. "Down here, the big push for growth in Florida has been in the suburbs, but for the next generation, it may not be in the suburbs. We may be facing the depopulation of the suburbs."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some bedroom communities are cutting their reliance on housing. One example: Tavares, an old railroad and lumber community of about 13,000 northwest of Orlando. Seaplanes have landed in the middle of Lake Dora there for years, but when the city held a series of "visioning" sessions with residents, the idea of becoming "America's Seaplane City" took off. The city is the first in Florida to use seaplanes as a way to market the community. A $4.26 million seaplane base and marina opened last April and is now at the center of Tavares' economic development strategy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We created a pride and well-being," says former mayor Nancy Clutts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A culture change</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Changing the culture that embraces property rights in parts of the country where space seems endless is a challenge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That culture is very much caught in an intertwined relationship between the consumer, the builder, the financing (institution)," Ley says. "It's a culture that has to be undone."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When a community is accustomed to growth, "It's really hard for them to get out of that mindset," Hollander says. "It's hard for them to recognize that conditions have changed drastically and that they're in a position to do something different."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The transformation may be pushed along by:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Gas prices. As the cost of a gallon of gas starts to near $4, the 45-minute commute loses its appeal. Research by think tanks such as the Center for Neighborhood Technology shows that households in distant suburbs spend more on transportation than they save on housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Environmental concerns. Protecting natural resources and reducing U.S. dependence on foreign oil are part of the national agenda. Living in smaller homes near public transit or within walking distance of stores and services can lower energy use and preserve green space by not using up as much land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Social and demographic change. Young adults don't want to live in gated subdivisions far from entertainment, shopping and jobs, according to research by CEOs for Cities, a non-profit alliance of urban leaders. More are delaying marriage and childbirth, extending the time they're likely to want an urban lifestyle. Also, 77 million Baby Boomers are or soon will be empty nesters, and many are gravitating back to urban centers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We need to provide diversity in housing, provide choices for young people who say they are not ready to take care of a yard and want to be in the downtown area," says Debra Stark, planning director for the city of Phoenix, where light rail now connects downtown with Tempe, home of Arizona State University, and Mesa. It eventually will stretch northwest to Glendale, another large suburb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not just a theme park</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city of Orlando caught on to these changes long before the housing crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People think of Orlando as a theme park," says Dean Grandin Jr., director of the city planning and development department. "Orlando is a real city with a real downtown, real neighborhoods."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city has more than 100 lakes, and it has created "villages" around many of them to shape a sense of place with recreational, residential and job opportunities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Everything we do is geared toward further quality of life," Grandin says. "We're not afraid of dense development."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Amtrak station is being redeveloped. The new Amway Center, home of the National Basketball Association's Orlando Magic, has opened. A "creative village" that focuses on the growing digital media industry -- companies that produce interactive media such as video games or military simulation -- has been developed nearby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orlando is creating three "medical cities" around hospitals, medical schools and research facilities. Baldwin Park, site of the former Orlando Naval Training Center, now is a city within a city, offering a wide range of residential choices, from custom million- dollar homes to condominiums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The unintended consequence of the housing collapse is that it could benefit cities," Grandin says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Money talks</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If environmental consciousness or urban lifestyles aren't strong enough motivations to persuade communities to change the way they grow, the lure of more tax revenue might.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Suburban development does not pay its way," says Peter Katz, director of smart growth and urban planning in Florida's Sarasota County and an advocate of New Urbanism -- the movement that embraces traditional design used before the advent of the automobile, such as stores, homes and parks within walking distance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Katz showed county officials that 1350 Main, a high-rise development in Sarasota that has commercial and residential space on less than one acre, generates 142 times more property tax revenue per acre than a <span class="companylink">Walmart</span> or big suburban mall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The mixed-use high-rise pays back the whole infrastructure tab in three years," he says, because roads, power, water and sewer lines already exist. "A suburban housing development will take 42 years."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shelley Lauten, president of myregion.org, says the mayors and county leaders in 86 Florida cities and seven counties meet regularly to tackle regional issues, including water and transportation -- all part of a "How Shall We Grow" plan the organization drafted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Florida has always traditionally known cheap housing and cheap labor," Lauten says. "We're all struggling with the same thing ... better uses of land."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She says the region will emerge from the slump in better shape because it is being forced to diversify its economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For me, it's a perfect time to change the mindset," Lauten says. "Think about the lessons of Detroits that did not diversify their economies."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lang says that Sun Belt states are embracing diversification but don't necessarily see a connection between their challenges and those facing the Rust Belt. Growth will return there, he says, and that's why "a vacant lot in Las Vegas is not a vacant lot in Cleveland."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wealthy Americans seem to have decided that it's OK to splurge again -- a hopeful sign for an economy mired by slow growth, stubbornly high unemployment and depressed home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luxury and high-end marketers have picked up on what they hope is a growing trend, offering products that bank on a looming spending spree. Germany's PG-Bikes is rolling out the $80,000 Black Trail, a battery-powered bicycle. Swiss watchmaker Richard Mille is selling $525,000 timepieces. Steinway has launched a John Lennon-themed grand piano -- at $90,000 and up. After selling out a $245,000 model, automaker Porsche is planning the 918 Spyder, a hybrid car that could sell for more than $630,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And for the 2011 holiday season, tech start-up Prima Cinema will provide a $20,000 device to bring Hollywood films to your home the same day they premiere in theaters. Each first-run film will cost an additional $500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The products represent rarified shopping territory for even the uber-rich, especially at a time when the nation is coming out of its worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. To many still worried about the economy, spending for luxury goods and ultra-toys with eye-popping price tags is silly. Even so, the trickle of high- end products aimed at deep-pocketed clientele is a potential leading indicator of a broader wave of pervasive conspicuous consumption among middle- and upper-income shoppers, analysts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If the wealthy are buying, there's a huge downstream effect: It goes all the way down to the $50,000 (annual income) household," says Selling to the New Elite author Jim Taylor, a marketing specialist with luxury brand consultant Harrison Group, whose annual Survey of Affluence and Wealth in America with American Express Publishing Group gauges shopping sentiment of the affluent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer spending is the main driver of economic growth. The nation's wealthiest 5% of households account for about 37% of consumer spending, according to <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some wealthy consumers have reined in over-the-top spending. Pam Danziger, whose Unity Marketing consultancy specializes in luxury branding, says that Baby Boomers, who make up a large chunk of wealthy households, have tempered shopping urges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The male source of pride used to be on how much they spent on fancy TVs, technology and other toys," Danziger says. "Now the bragging rights are over finding things at great prices. The mind- set at the luxury level and high end has changed."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, pent-up demand for luxury goods appears to have lessened the angst of other well-heeled shoppers. Luxury carmakers such as Porsche and marketers such as Mille say they've had little trouble lining up customers, wait-listing some and fielding offers from others willing to pay premiums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street's gains have helped put many in the mood to shop. Since hitting a 12-year low of 6547 in March 2009, the Dow Jones industrial average has surged 89% to 12,391.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When Wall Street crashed, it was very unsettling among the kings and queens of the universe," notes Wendy Liebmann, CEO of consultant WSL Strategic Retail. "It was as much about mind-set as it was about money. They just stopped spending because it wasn't appropriate to be seen spending. But the affluent are willing to spend again."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retail analysts sensed a coming shopping spree by the affluent as stock prices began climbing last fall. By the holidays, tony retailers such as <span class="companylink">Neiman Marcus</span>, Saks, Nordstrom and Tiffany were posting December same-store sales gains of up to 10% over the previous holiday season. Earlier this month, upscale retailer Ralph Lauren reported a 24% gain in quarterly revenue, while high-end grocery chain <span class="companylink">Whole Foods Market</span> posted a 12.6% gain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Personal embracement of luxury is now back to (pre-recession) 2007 levels," Taylor says. "We're seeing that in cars, private jet usage and, finally, in high-end real estate. There's a real change in the way people feel about money. They're making purchases they put off during the recession."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Porsche's U.S. sales in 2010 were up 29% over 2009; Cadillac's climbed 36%. Rolls-Royce sales rocketed 171%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vacation home sales in Cape Cod, Mass., rose 9% in 2010, compared with 2009. In Hilton Head, S.C., sales were up nearly 14%. Palm Beach, Fla., home sales surged nearly 40%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luxury home sales in hard-hit Southern California also are beginning to rebound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're starting to see movement," says Madison Hildebrand, who specializes in Beverly Hills and Malibu listings and stars on the Bravo reality show Million Dollar Listing. "People are more confident."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market for $1 million-plus yachts is also poised to set sail, says Thom Dammrich, president of the National Marine Manufacturers Association. "There's a high-quality crowd seriously looking to buy. That's changed since the downturn, which was brutal."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even high-end art is drawing post-recession buyers. <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> and Christie's, which handle more than 90% of fine art, book and collectibles sales, pulled in $1.1 billion during their fall auctions, almost double from 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The market hasn't completely recovered, but there were five (art) sales over $50 million last year. That's unprecedented, even during boom times," says Katherine Jentleson, analytics director at industry tracker Art Research Technologies. "There's clearly a lust for extreme luxury items."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Optimism for 2011</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ivan Drury, an analyst for auto industry tracker <span class="companylink">Edmunds.com</span>, estimates that the market for vehicles costing $100,000 and more surged 76% last year -- 32,144 sales, up from 18,288 in 2009. Porsche, which has received more than 2,000 orders nearly three years ahead of the hybrid 918's production, needed just two months to sell all 500 of its new 911 GT2 RS sports cars -- priced at $245,000. More than 25% were snapped up by U.S. buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some marketers, such as <span class="companylink">AutoNation</span>, sense fresh opportunity among newly affluent consumers and aspirational buyers. The nation's largest auto retailer will spend $100 million through 2012 on new and renovated showrooms for Mercedes-Benz, <span class="companylink">BMW</span>, Audi, Land Rover and Infinitis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Korea's Hyundai, best known for low-priced vehicles, steered into the luxury market with December's launch of the Equus. Prices start at $58,000 to $64,500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WealthTV, a San Diego-based cable channel focusing on luxury lifestyles, hopes to expand its affluent audience and lure upscale advertisers with this month's launch of Social, a 26-episode series featuring former Real Housewives of New Jersey socialite Danielle Staub mingling with the rich and famous. The channel already has seen a rebound for advertising from travel operators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We were fighting an uphill battle with the recession," says WealthTV President Charles Herring. "This year, we project to double what we did last year in advertising."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, Liebmann says the recession has altered some habits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The wealthy have learned some lessons. Like the rest of us working stiffs, they're buying selectively things they feel are really worth the price," she says. "It's as much about mind-set as it is about money."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like most of us, the wealthy want a good deal. Cadillac credits part of last year's success on the perceived value of its free, four- year/50,000-mile scheduled maintenance program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cadillac and other luxury marketers are also tweaking their mantras. Latest TV ads highlight power and technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a good time to be targeting luxury consumers, but the market is extremely competitive," says Cadillac marketing chief Don Butler. "We wanted ads that are visceral and emotionally engaging, but also showing that Cadillac has changed. We're no longer part of the same old club."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Audi's Super Bowl ad touted the technology-centric "new luxury" of its A8 model over rival Mercedes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some luxury marketers were slashing prices, Steinway rode out plummeting sales by cutting production and factory workers, relying on the brand's recession-proof reputation. Third-quarter sales were up 11% over 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have customers who don't even play the piano; they look at them as investments," says Ron Losby, president of Steinway &amp; Sons- Americas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its 50 Lennon-edition models, inspired by the late ex-Beatle's gift to Yoko Ono, have great potential value, Losby says. "There'll be no sleepless nights. We'll sell them all."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marketing exclusivity</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cool factor, not investment value, is a chief selling point of PG-Bikes' Black Trail. It has ultra-light carbon-fiber components and is powered by a battery capable of propelling riders at up to 62 mph.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The idea wasn't to create the most expensive bike, but the most technically advanced, lightest-weight electric bike," says company founder Manu Ostner. "Rich, successful people don't care about price. They care about quality and having something unique."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Production will be limited to about 700 bikes. Ostner expects to sell 250 to U.S. customers, hoping high-profile early adopters such as actor Orlando Bloom and Wall Street power players will spur interest for PG's lower-priced models. "They're the trendsetters who'll generate the sensibility and sexiness of clean mobility," Ostner says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What makes Richard Mille's watch worth $525,000? The Rafael Nadal RM 027 Tourbillon is more about technology than glitz, featuring titanium and carbon composites used in satellites. At less than 20 grams, it is billed as the world's lightest wristwatch. Spanish tennis star Nadal wears his on the courts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just 50 will be made, attracting collectors and well-heeled wearers. Before its August launch, Mille had more than 100 orders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It may be ostentatious driving a new luxury car in your neighborhood or around co-workers, but a guy across the room wouldn't know what this watch is," says Dominique Gerente, Mille's marketing chief for North and South America. "It's much more personal. With this watch, you become a member of a club."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Current "members" include rapper/entertainment mogul Jay-Z and musician Seal. No worries if you're not on the list. In September, Mille's rolling out the RM038 Bubba Watson, named for the professional golfer, also for $525,000. Want something cheaper? Mille watches start at about $50,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forking out as much for a watch as a car or home makes Prima Cinema's $20,000 home movie-premiere service seem a relative bargain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, there were plenty of skeptics when CEO Jason Pang initially approached movie studios and investors for partnership deals for the technology, previously available to Hollywood VIPS, during the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It sounded elitist. They didn't think anyone would pay $20,000 for the technology, and there was sticker shock at $500 movies," Pang says. "But then you tell them that people spend hundreds of thousands on custom home theaters or $20,000 to charter private jets. And when you take your family to an NBA game or host a kids' birthday party, you're spending hundreds of dollars."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now that partnerships are in place, Pang expects to sell his digital delivery system to 250,000 households by 2015. "Word of mouth is driving sales, and we're not even trying," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street's extended post-recession rally likely will continue to goose sales of high-end items. It has also begun to swing momentum across a broader shopping spectrum. January same-store sales at the nation's biggest chain stores climbed 4.2%, according to a 28-retailer survey by tracker Thomson Reuters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As broader stock market indicators such as the Nasdaq composite index near 10-year highs, the financial market's so-called wealth effect could energize an extended burst of luxury-related splurging. Mercedes-Benz, for example, says U.S. sales rose 14% last month over January 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"During the recession, even the wealthy became needs-based shoppers," says Harrison Group's Taylor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"But the scope of their needs is expanding. The capacity to spend is back in play."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent economic crisis has cracked one of the pillars of the American Dream: home ownership. While owning a home isn't right for everyone, we can't forget the fact that it has historically been the best way for many people to accumulate wealth and build stable communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government has played a role in helping Americans purchase homes for more than 60 years. Housing accounts for more than 15% of our nation's gross domestic product, and a stable housing market will play a big part in rebuilding the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's clear that the government's current role in the mortgage market is too big. But we must also note that kicking the government out completely will increase home costs for most people, as well as the cost for rental housing. A fully private market won't provide the types of mortgages on which we have traditionally relied, and it won't provide reliable access to mortgages in times of economic stress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We believe there is a better way, one that relies on private capital, but is backed by a limited but explicit government backstop with taxpayer protections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mortgage Bankers Association has advanced such an idea, and the White House included it as an option in its proposal last week. It calls for a select number of privately held, strictly regulated mortgage credit guarantor entities that would buy only safe, standard mortgages. These entities would then issue mortgage-backed securities to ensure an affordable flow of mortgage credit for qualified borrowers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private money -- and only private money -- would fund these entities. If an individual mortgage failed, the entity would take the loss. The government would be there only to insure the security itself in the event of a catastrophic failure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there's one more safety catch: To protect the taxpayers from yet another bailout, the entities themselves would fund the government insurance by paying fees on every security they issue, similar to the system in place for insuring bank deposits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The past three years have been rough. Even so, it shouldn't force us to make mortgage credit much more expensive for years to come. Striking the right balance of private business and government support is critical to rebuilding a system that keeps the American Dream alive for everyone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael D. Berman is chairman of the Mortgage Bankers Association.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates rose this week to their highest level in 10 months, but the increase isn't expected to derail strengthening in the battered U.S. housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> reported Thursday that 30-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 5.05% this week. That's the highest since late April and up sharply from a modern record low of 4.17% in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rates would have to rise much more to squelch a housing market recovery, economists say. And the federal government would likely take steps to pull rates down if that occurred, they add.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Nobody is welcoming a rise in interest rates but it's not enough to kill purchases in the housing market," says Keith Gumbinger of mortgage researcher HSH.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To discourage large numbers of sales, rates would have to top 6%, predicts ISH Global Insight economist Patrick Newport. If they went over 5.5%, that would likely spur government action, adds Cameron Findlay, LendingTree chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though rates have been rising since November, they're still low by historical standards. For the past 20 years, 30-year fixed loans have averaged 6.9%, Findlay says. For the past 10 years, they averaged 5.93%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low rates and low home prices helped fourth-quarter home sales, the National Association of Realtors reported Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, fourth-quarter sales rose 15% from the third quarter. But they were still 20% below a year earlier, when federal tax credits artificially boosted sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median prices for single-family homes were up year-over-year in 78 of 152 metropolitan areas. But they were up just 0.2% nationwide, the NAR said. Newport expects prices to drop further and begin to turn around midyear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The association's data indicate several larger markets posted healthy price gains due to stronger job growth. In Washington, D.C., median prices were up 8.1% year-over-year. The Boston region posted a 4.2% rise, and Austin was up 4.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Sales clearly recovered in the latter part of 2010," says Lawrence Yun, NAR economist. He expects sales to pick up this year despite interest rates he predicts will be 5.5% or higher by year's end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But job creation "will trump the rise in rates" and keep home sales improving, Yun says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher rates will have a bigger impact on refinancing activity, Gumbinger says. That fell 8% for the week ended Feb. 4 as interest rates jumped, the Mortgage Bankers Association says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates follow yields on 10-year Treasury bonds, which have been rising recently.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MERCED, Calif. -- Life has changed in ways big and small in this central California county, which is still trapped in the wreckage of a housing boom that went bust five years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median home price, $116,000, is down 68% from its peak in 2006. Three of five homeowners with a mortgage here owe more on their loans than their houses are worth, compared with about one in five nationally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Socked by a sharp loss of property and sales tax revenue, Merced County and its cities have slashed budgets, workers and services. The grass is being mowed less often in city parks. A senior center is open fewer hours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Families have adjusted, too. Forget dreams of making big bucks on California real estate. Many here now count the years -- guessing, really -- until they'll no longer owe more on their homes than they're worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're in survival mode, waiting for recovery," says Stephen Hammond, 42, pastor at Bethel Community Church in Los Banos, a Merced County town of 35,000 amid cotton and tomato fields.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More cuts are possible because of looming budget deficits, Merced government officials say. Dozens of other communities nationwide may face the same tough choices in the wake of huge drops in home values, which often lead to less property tax revenue. In Merced, the impacts have hit hard, and they hint at what may be to come for others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Merced County government, property taxes are the No. 1 source of general fund revenue, says Scott De Moss, deputy county executive officer. Property tax revenue has dropped 25% during the past three years. Almost 15% of the county's workforce has been slashed. Social and mental health service positions took the biggest hits, officials say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the city of Merced, sales tax revenue is down 24% and property tax collections, about 34%, from 2007 levels, city officials say. That's forced cuts in the police and fire departments. Police might not show up anymore to take fender bender reports and firetrucks may no longer always roll on the same calls as ambulances, says Merced City Manager John Bramble. The city's 80,000 trees now get pruned once every three years, instead of every two. The senior center is open 28, not 40, hours a week. Asphalt patches, not new concrete, are being used to repair sidewalks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People are used to a higher level of service," says Bill Spriggs, who serves as mayor for the city of 80,600. "But this is the new normal."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Los Banos, the grass is now cut in city parks every 15 days. It used to be cut weekly. Vacant houses dot nearly every neighborhood. New roads end in cul-de-sacs surrounded by vacant lots. A weather-beaten billboard announces a 35,000-square-foot retail center that is "coming soon" but never has.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This was, right here, all going to be industry," says Tommy Jones, Los Banos' former mayor, as he points to a goat pasture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, local governments typically get more than half of their revenue from local sources, the largest of which is property taxes, says economics professor John Anderson at the University of Nebraska. Because property tax collections can lag behind market values by 18 months to several years, they continued to rise for U.S. cities through 2009 -- despite housing price declines in most areas. But city property tax collections fell 2% last year as reduced assessments started to kick in, according to survey data collected by the National League of Cities. More drops are expected this year and next as the decline continues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Merced city and county governments have softened the blow to services by eating through millions in financial reserves. But budget deficits are still the norm. This summer, Merced city plans to ask residents to approve a half-cent sales tax increase to cover a $5.2 million budget shortfall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the new tax doesn't pass, Bramble says, "The quality of city services will be severely changed."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Underwater, with few options</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The double whammy of the recession and the real estate crash has forced changes in how consumers spend, plan for their futures and view their neighbors. Businesses also have suffered, because homeowners have less equity in their homes or none at all. Overlaying everything is a local economy in which one of five workers is jobless, in part because of the collapse of the area's once-fast-growing home construction industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The "last good year" was 2008, says Greg Parle, owner of the Branding Iron Restaurant in Merced. Business is off at least 20% since then, he says. He's adding lower-priced items to the menu.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The region's ability to foster such small businesses will suffer because of so much lost home equity. Almost one-quarter of small- business owners borrow against their homes or use them as collateral to fuel businesses, according to a 2009 Gallup survey of small- business owners. That'll likely be less now in Merced and other places with so many underwater homeowners. Start-ups will feel the greatest impact, says Mark Schweitzer, director of research for the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Loreina Childress, 39, a county environmental health worker, has felt the impact of the new normal at home and work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The previous work of 26 in her department is now done by 21. At home, a lot remains vacant, and there are more renters in her neighborhood than before the real estate bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Childress bought her Merced County home in 2006, when the market was still hot. She owes $241,000 on the 1,500-square-foot home that might sell for $140,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her husband, Gary, 38, switched careers a year ago, from forklift driver to emergency medical technician. He can't find full-time work. That's placed new stress on the family's finances, along with the reality of being so far underwater on the house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Loreina now pours milk in her coffee, not cream. She eats TV dinners at her desk for lunch, rather than fresh sandwiches at a deli. She can recite, down to the penny, the cost of South Beach Diet bars at three retailers. Plans to landscape the yard have been scrapped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gary might have more luck pursuing work in other states. That would mean selling the house at a big loss or doing what the couple say they won't do: Give the house back to the bank and walk away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We made an agreement," Loreina says. "We can't go anywhere until we can break even on the house."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Los Banos Unified School District Superintendent Steve Tietjen, 55, is underwater on his home, too. He bought his Los Banos home in 2007. If a job change appears, "I'll have a dilemma," he says. "I never would've conceived that somebody who's a superintendent would have that dilemma."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like Tietjen, many people here know someone who lost their house - - either because of a job loss or a decision not to stick it out. Some former homeowners now rent. Some bought other homes at distressed prices, then walked away from underwater ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Betham, 58, and his wife, Sandra, 55, are staying put. They owe $375,000 on their Los Banos home. They estimate it would sell now for $150,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bethams both teach in Los Banos. They can make the house payments and will delay their retirements if needed. They love their house and feel an obligation to pay the debt. "A lot of these people bailed. But we did everything right, and we're stuck," John says. "It's a bit of a bitter pill."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not much relief in sight</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Little relief is expected anytime soon here, despite signs of a strengthening U.S. economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, home prices are down 30% from their 2006 peak. <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics economist Celia Chen says national home prices will regain that ground by 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some areas will take far longer. In 22 U.S. metropolitan regions, most in California and Florida, home prices won't return to their 2006 peaks before 2030, Chen estimates. That includes such cities as Miami, Detroit, Phoenix, Las Vegas and Riverside, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Merced is so far off its peak that it'll take "many decades" for home prices to return to their 2006 peaks, Chen says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like other central California communities, Merced's housing boom was fueled by San Francisco Bay Area commuters looking for cheaper housing. The opening of a University of California campus in Merced in 2005 attracted builders and investors who saw a big future for rentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2005, almost 3,500 single-family-home building permits were issued in Merced County, <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> data show. That was up from an average of 1,053 a year in the 1990s. Merced's unemployment rate dropped below 10% in 2006 as home construction soared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Merced's fall was just as steep. Since 2006, the county has lost more than 2,500 construction jobs, state employment data indicate. In the past three years, just 415 single-family building permits have been issued countywide. Last year, one of 14 Merced homes received foreclosure filings vs. one of 45 nationwide, says researcher RealtyTrac.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newcomers to Merced are winning in the hard-times economy. Home prices are so low that sales are made "as fast as we can stick a (for sale) sign in the ground," says Loren Gonella, owner of Gonella Realty in Merced. In December, median prices were up 5% from a year ago, he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He says home prices will recover. The UC campus is expanding, as is a relatively new hospital. <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span> plans to open a distribution center here in the next few years, which would eventually employ up to 900. The San Francisco Bay Area has funneled home buyers to the Central Valley for decades. That will continue, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The feared mass exodus from the county has not occurred. In Los Banos, student enrollment dipped in 2008 and 2009 but has returned to 2006 levels, Tietjen says. In many cases, multiple families inhabit homes that used to contain one, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ray Ortiz, 40, bought his Los Banos home in 2009 for $150,000. At the peak, it would have cost more than $400,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ortiz commutes 90 minutes to his job in San Jose as a maintenance supervisor for a garbage company. He pays $50 more a month to own in Los Banos than he would to rent in San Jose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if home prices drop more before they go up, Ortiz is confident he made a good buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I feel like I won the lottery," he says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A congressionally appointed panel reported Thursday that the financial crisis that set off the Great Recession was avoidable, casting a wide net of blame over regulators and financial giants alike.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report -- the government's first comprehensive review of what caused the crisis -- offers a detailed and compellingly written narrative of an epic financial tailspin. It also raises an unavoidable question: More than two years after the financial crisis and more than six months after Congress passed sweeping financial reform, is it relevant?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some say its impact will be muted because it was not supported by Republican members of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission. Others say much of the ground it covers was hashed out in previous hearings or reports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report is flawed, critics say. After more than a year of analysis costing $10 million, the 10-member Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission could not agree fully on the factors behind the crisis, issuing three different versions of the story told along partisan lines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The impact is diminished by the political nature of the report," says Arthur Levitt, former Securities and Exchange Commission chief. "The fact it had a divided authorship is never very constructive."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, Ed Mierzwinski of U.S. PIRG, a consumer group, says the report vindicates the financial-regulatory reforms passed by Congress last year. Wall Street firms are trying to delay or weaken some of the rules, saying it will harm U.S. competitiveness. "The main takeaway is, don't let Wall Street roll back Wall Street reform," he said. It "should be implemented as quickly and strongly as possible."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Majority findings</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The captains of finance and the public stewards of our financial system ignored warnings and failed to question, understand, and manage evolving risks within a system essential to the well-being of the American public," the nearly 600-page report says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result of the crisis, the nation fell into the deepest economic slump in 70 years, sending millions into unemployment and costing taxpayers trillions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The financial crisis was fueled by low interest rates and a booming housing market. As the subprime mortgage market boomed, so did demand for packages of risky mortgage-backed securities. Lenders eagerly made high-risk, subprime loans and sold them into the burgeoning mortgage-backed securities market. When the housing bubble burst, the value of mortgage-backed securities tumbled, taking down some of the nation's biggest financial firms: <span class="companylink">Bear Stearns</span>, <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, <span class="companylink">Countrywide Financial</span> and <span class="companylink">Lehman Bros</span>., among others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The FCIC's analysis included a review of millions of pages of documents, interviews with more than 700 witnesses and 19 days of public hearings in parts of the country that were hard hit by the crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The committee's final report, approved by the six Democratic commissioners, said the crisis was evident long before <span class="companylink">Lehman Bros</span>. fell in September 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report says industry and government players at every layer of the financial system saw brightly flashing warning signs at every turn but chose to ignore or downplay them. The commission singles out the Federal Reserve as "the one entity" that could have stemmed the flow of toxic mortgages but failed to do so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the Federal Reserve held hearings on predatory mortgages as early as 2000, it failed to follow through on proposals to require lenders to verify that borrowers could repay their mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We want to encourage the growth in the subprime lending market," Fed Governor Edward Gramlich said in early 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed General Counsel Scott Alvarez told the commission: "There was concern that if you put a broad rule, you would stop things that were not unfair and deceptive." Ultimately, the Fed toughened its rules in 2002 but only modestly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage lenders were aware of the dangers. In 2004 and 2005, <span class="companylink">Countrywide Financial</span> CEO Angelo Mozilo e-mailed senior managers that subprime loans could bring "financial and reputational catastrophe" to the company. But that didn't stop Countrywide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financial giants, meanwhile, were snapping up the loans and packaging them into securities, despite the risks, to keep pace with rivals. "A decision was made that we're going to have to hold our nose and start buying the stated product if we want to stay in business," <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> banker Richard Bowen told the commission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">American International Group</span>, which sold investors derivatives known as credit default swaps -- insurance in case the mortgage securities defaulted -- was similarly worried about impending doom. Former AIG CEO Maurice Greenberg told the commission that when the firm lost its AAA rating for the swaps in spring 2005, "it would have been logical for AIG to have exited or reduced its business." Instead, the company issued another $36 billion in credit default swaps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government-backed mortgage giant <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> was on a mission to perk up profits. As early as 2005, Thomas Lund, Fannie's head of single-family lending, told colleagues that risk had "accelerated dramatically." Yet, the firm widened its exposure to risky mortgages to compete.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commission, in fact, concluded that <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> "followed rather than led Wall Street" and so were not a "primary cause" of the crisis. That contradicts the view of some economists and Republican lawmakers who blame the giants, which bought the lion's share of mortgages and were placed in a federal conservatorship in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report also spotlights credit-rating agencies, "essential cogs in the wheels of financial destruction," as they awarded high ratings to securities that they barely investigated. The rub: <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> was paid by the very companies it assigned ratings for. After <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> went public in 2000, it went "from (a culture) resembling a university academic department to one which values revenue at all costs," said Eric Kolchinsky, a former managing director.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report says lax regulation had been longstanding. "More than 30 years of deregulation and reliance on self-regulation by financial institutions, championed by former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan and others, supported by successive administrations and Congresses, and actively pushed by the powerful financial industry at every turn, had stripped away key safeguards, which could have helped avoid catastrophe," the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Major dissent</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a Thursday press conference via phone, commission Vice Chairman Bill Thomas, a former congressman and one of the three Republican dissenters, railed at what he called the politically driven "bumper sticker" type explanation for the cause of the crisis stated in the Democrat-dominated majority's report findings. Thomas also said the viewpoints of the commission's Republican members were downplayed in the final report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Republican trio argue that the Democrats' conclusion places too great an emphasis on missteps made by U.S. regulators and bankers, and ignores the global nature of the economic crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That group of dissenters, which includes Keith Hennessey and Douglas Holtz-Eakin, two senior economic advisers to former president George W. Bush, places most of the blame on a global credit crisis caused in large part from a glut of savings from China and other countries that found their way to the U.S., resulting in record low interest rates. Those low borrowing costs helped inflate real estate bubbles in the U.S. and Europe. Singling out lax regulations in U.S. markets doesn't tell the whole story, they argue, since Europe suffered similar economic problems despite more stringent regulations than here in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"By focusing too narrowly on U.S. regulatory policy and supervision, ignoring international parallels, emphasizing only arguments for greater regulation, failing to prioritize the causes, and failing to distinguish sufficiently between causes and effects, the majority's report is unbalanced and leads to incorrect conclusions about what caused the crisis," the three dissenters concluded in their report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second view comes from the other GOP panel member, Peter Wallison of the American Enterprise Institute. He argues that the government policy to increase homeownership in the U.S. resulted in less stringent mortgage underwriting standards and some 27 million risky subprime loans that set the housing market up for a fall once the real estate bubble began to deflate. Had the government not embarked on this policy, "the great financial crisis of 2008 would not have occurred," Wallison argued in his written dissent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Too little, too late?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics of the committee's work say that it uncovered little new ground and offered no policy changes to thwart another meltdown. "The fact that it doesn't cover new ground means its impact will be negligible," says Levitt, now a consultant for the <span class="companylink">Carlyle Group</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A lot of good books have dissected these factors and causes," says Robert Pozen, author of The Fund Industry - How Your Money is Managed. "The real question is, what do we do from here." Currently, many aspects of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, passed last year, have yet to be finalized with regulators. Congress has yet to tackle reform of mortgage giants <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> and <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>. "It doesn't take a brilliant scientist to realize that the biggest area not touched is home mortgages," Pozen says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the panel was formed to investigate causes of the crisis, not recommend solutions, the majority says in the report. It was also instructed to report evidence of criminal wrongdoing to the appropriate authorities. Chairman Phil Angelides said Thursday that the commission passed along names to the authorities but would not say how many people were cited.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">List</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Timeline</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Events in the financial crisis:</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*October 2008: The Dow Jones industrial average falls below 10,000 for the first time in four years. The Troubled Asset Relief Program is passed, extending federal aid to banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*December 2009: Home prices have dropped 28% from their 2006 peak. Almost 10% of all residential mortgages are seriously delinquent, with no payments made in 90 days or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Mid-2010: All major loan originators and underwriters are facing lawsuits over their lending and underwriting practices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Fall 2010: One of every 11 outstanding residential mortgage loans is at least one payment past due but not yet in foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Fall 2010: State attorneys general unite to investigate mortgage servicing practices after reports that thousands of foreclosure documents may have been improperly prepared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*December 2010: For the first time, lenders repossess more than 1 million homes in a year. The government's mortgage modification program, begun in 2009, has resulted in permanent modifications of 520,000 mortgages; banks report they have independently approved 3.4 million loan alterations.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">List</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Excerpts from the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission's report</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a book-length report, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission tells a story about the signs foretelling the crisis, how it unfolded and its aftermath. Excerpts:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the storm</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the surface, it looked like prosperity. After all, the basic mechanisms making the real estate machine hum -- the mortgage- lending instruments and the financing techniques that turned mortgages into investments called securities, which kept cash flowing from Wall Street into the U.S. housing market -- were tools that had worked well for many years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But underneath, something was going wrong. Like a science- fiction movie in which ordinary household objects turn hostile, familiar market mechanisms were being transformed. The time-tested 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, with a 20% down payment, went out of style. There was a burgeoning global demand for residential mortgage- backed securities that offered seemingly solid and secure returns. Investors around the world clamored to purchase securities built on American real estate, seemingly one of the safest bets in the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street labored mightily to meet that demand. Bond salesmen earned multimillion-dollar bonuses packaging and selling new kinds of loans, offered by new kinds of lenders, into new kinds of investment products that were deemed safe but possessed complex and hidden risks. Federal officials praised the changes -- these financial innovations, they said, had lowered borrowing costs for consumers and moved risks away from the biggest and most systemically important financial institutions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the nation's financial system had become vulnerable and interconnected in ways that were not understood by either the captains of finance or the system's public stewards. In fact, some of the largest institutions had taken on what would prove to be debilitating risks. Trillions of dollars had been wagered on the belief that housing prices would always rise and that borrowers would seldom default on mortgages, even as their debt grew. Shaky loans had been bundled into investment products in ways that seemed to give investors the best of both worlds -- high-yield, risk-free - - but instead, in many cases, would prove to be high-risk and yield- free.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trouble arrives</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the course of 2007, the collapse of the housing bubble and the abrupt shutdown of subprime lending led to losses for many financial institutions, runs on money market funds, tighter credit, and higher interest rates. ...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although government officials knew about the deterioration in the subprime markets, they misjudged the risks posed to the financial system. The Treasury and Fed insisted throughout the spring and early summer that the damage would be limited.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The impact on the broader economy and financial markets of the problems in the subprime market seems likely to be contained," Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke testified before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress on March 28. That same day, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson told a House Appropriations subcommittee: "From the standpoint of the overall economy, my bottom line is we're watching it closely but it appears to be contained."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest bankruptcy</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Solvency should be a simple financial concept: if your assets are worth more than your liabilities, you are solvent; if not, you are in danger of bankruptcy. But on the afternoon of Friday, September 12, 2008, experts from the country's biggest commercial and investment banks met at the Wall Street offices of the Federal Reserve to ponder the fate of <span class="companylink">Lehman Bros</span>., and could not agree whether or not the 157-year-old firm was solvent. ...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The debate will continue over the largest bankruptcy in American history, but nothing will change the basic facts: a consortium of banks would fail to agree on a rescue, two last-minute deals would fall through, and the government would decide not to rescue this investment bank -- for financial reasons, for political reasons, for practical reasons, for philosophical reasons, and because, as Bernanke told the FCIC, if the government had lent money, "the firm would fail, and not only would we be unsuccessful but we would have saddled the taxpayer with tens of billions of dollars of losses."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the day that Lehman filed for bankruptcy, the Dow plummeted more than 500 points; $700 billion in value from retirement plans, government pension funds, and other investment portfolios disappeared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Legacy of a crash</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Karen Mann, an appraiser from Discovery Bay, Calif., testified to the commission (that) her daughter and son-in-law refinanced their mortgage into an adjustable-rate mortgage. When the time came for the rate to adjust upward, new financial troubles made the payments more than the family could afford. Because the market value of the home was nearly equal to their mortgage debt, the family's attempts to get the mortgage modified were fruitless.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, when medical problems created yet another challenge, the couple and their four children moved in with Mann. "The children were relocated to new schools, and the adults dealt with the pain and emotional suffering while they were trying to rebuild their lives," Mann said. The couple filed for bankruptcy. Two months after the bankruptcy was completed, the lender asked them if they wanted to modify their mortgage.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing industry is poised to gain strength this year after coming off one of its worst years ever in 2010, economic forecasts and new data released Wednesday show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One cause for optimism: Building permits for new single-family homes rose 5.5% last month, the third-consecutive monthly increase and the strongest showing since March, the Commerce Department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That sets the stage for more home construction later this year as the economy improves, says Celia Chen, economist at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The trend is up," Chen says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it'll be a slow slog. The previous two years have been the worst on record for home builders in at least 50 years. Nationwide, home prices are down almost 30% from their 2006 peak. A new USA TODAY survey of 44 top economists finds that 48% say average home prices won't hit bottom until sometime this year, and 27% say it'll take longer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market recovery "will be two baby steps forward and one backward," says Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The theme of slow improvement is likely to be repeated in December's existing home sales data, to be reported today. A small gain is expected over November, says IHS Global Insight economist Patrick Newport.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also says that December's permit numbers indicate that housing construction "may be set to grow again." But some of December's jump may have been driven by builders trying to get permits ahead of 2011 building code changes in California, New York and Pennsylvania, the Commerce Department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newport also cautions that home-building numbers "are still really awful." Housing starts, for example, fell 4.3% in December as cold weather and snow delayed construction. But Newport says other factors will continue to depress housing starts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those include low prices on foreclosed homes, which makes it hard for builders to turn profits on new homes, and tight financing for home builders and buyers. What's more, the recession sharply reduced the rate of household formation, which means that more families are doubling up in homes vs. each getting their own, Newport says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Moody's</span> doesn't see home construction getting back to more historically normal levels until at least 2012, Chen says. USA TODAY's economist survey indicates that 669,000 new home starts are likely this year, up 15% from 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The key is job creation, says Lawrence Yun, chief economist with the National Association of Realtors. When more people are working, and earning higher incomes, home buying increases. IHS expects the economy to add 2.5 million jobs this year and 2.7 million next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The (housing) market appears to have hit bottom, and now we're trying to get back to normal," Yun says.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home prices fell 5.1% in November from a year earlier and are expected to go lower as the housing market struggles to find its recovery, according to a report Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate analytics firm <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> said that single-family home prices declined for the fourth month in a row and at a faster pace. They dropped 3.4% in October year-over-year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">November declines occurred in 44 states, up from 18 in June when federal tax credits for home buyers were still pumping up sales. Sales and prices fell after the credits expired.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The credits "created the illusion that the market was stronger than it's been," says Patrick Newport, economist at IHS Global Insight. His firm predicts national home prices will fall 5% to 7% more this year before potentially rebounding later in the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rather than draw many new buyers into the market, the credits "just pulled sales forward," says Sam Khater, <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> senior economist. The higher rate of decline in prices in November from October underscores the big challenges the market faces with recovery, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The state of the housing market isn't good news for the overall economy, which is showing improvement. But lower home prices are also not surprising given the expiration of the tax credits, says economist Mark Zandi of <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics. The economy avoided a double-dip recession, but "Housing is double dipping," he says. Zandi expects home prices to continue to decline, about 5%, until at least midyear. By the time prices hit bottom, the housing crash will have lasted five years and driven prices 35% off their 2006 peak, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> reports November prices did rise in six states: Indiana, Vermont, New York, Wyoming, North Dakota and Maine. Maine led the nation with an 8.6% jump, followed by North Dakota at 4.4%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In general, states seeing rising prices didn't experience the real estate boom to the extent that other states did, and so they aren't feeling the bust as much, says IHS Global Insight analyst James Diffley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Market researcher Zillow, which doesn't include foreclosure sales in its data, says November marked the 53rd- consecutive month of declining home values. Zillow's data show national home prices down 5.1% in November from November 2009, resetting to levels last seen in October 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zillow expects sustained declines until late 2011. Even then, "The bottom will be very long and rocky," says Zillow chief economist Stan Humphries.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite rumors of an upcoming collapse in commercial real estate, real estate mutual funds continue to bring home solid returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors bracing for part two of the financial crisis, this time in commercial real estate, missed out on a 27.6% gain, according to Lipper, by real estate mutual funds in 2010. These funds capitalized on discounted prices for commercial property and real estate investment trusts as well as lucrative dividend yields.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There was less of a distressed environment (for commercial real estate) than many perceived," says David Lee, portfolio manger of the <span class="companylink">T. Rowe Price Real Estate</span> fund, one of the top-performing real estate funds last year, returning 29.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using 2010 as a guide, investors are closely watching trends going into 2011 that might influence real estate mutual funds, including:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Changing dividend yields. The fact commercial real estate investments tend to pay market-beating dividends is one of its big attractions. But thanks in part to the jump in REIT stock prices, the group is currently yielding 3.5%, which is low relative to historical averages and current long-term Treasury rates, says Keven Lindemann of SNL Financial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big wild card, though, is that manyREITs are boosting their dividend payouts. During 2010, 52 REITs of the 125 that SNL tracks increased their dividends, a trend that bodes well for future yields, Lindemann says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Shifting real estate demand amid economic recovery. While investors tend to look at REITs as a group, mutual fund managers know to slice the market into areas that behave differently during economic cycles, Lee says. Hotel and apartment REITs, for instance, were standouts in 2010. Hotels have enjoyed higher room rates and occupancy. Hotel REITs returned 41% in 2010, Lindemann says. Even the laggards, office and industrialREITS, returned 21% and 19%, respectively, despite concerns of slow job growth, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Improving health of real estate companies. Real estate companies, relatively high borrowers, were mostly able to refinance their debt during 2009 and are in much better health now, says Ron Florance, managing director of investment strategy for Wells Fargo Private Bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apartment REITs have also benefited as people didn't rush to buy homes or were unable to get mortgages, he says. Apartment REITs returned 48% in 2010, making them the top performers, SNL says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But commercial real estate funds face dangers. REITs' dividend yields are less attractive as Treasury yields rise, Florance says. Many commercial real estate companies, meanwhile, face debt payments the next four years that could become onerous if the economy isn't healthy, Lindemann says. "It would be very surprising ... if we saw another year of such significant outperformance."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market's climb from the depths of depression is continuing at an uneven pace, and economists say signs point to further slow improvement in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The trend is starting to move in the right direction," says Diane Swonk, chief economist at financial services firm <span class="companylink">Mesirow Financial</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A string of new housing data is building optimism. Existing home sales in November rose 5.6% from October to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.68 million, the National Association of Realtors reported Wednesday. Demand has steadily improved since bottoming in July following the end of the buyers' tax credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home sales data for November, out today, are also expected to show slight improvement after an October that made the third-worst showing in 47 years, says IHS Global Insight. Last week, the Commerce Department reported that housing starts rose almost 4% in November, the first uptick in new home production since August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite signs of improvement, economists and home builders say next year will remain tough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices, down almost 30% from their 2006 peak, will fall 5% to 7% more before potentially rebounding later in the year, says Patrick Newport, IHS Global Insight economist. Banks will repossess 1 million U.S. homes next year, on top of 1 million this year, says market researcher RealtyTrac.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The glut of foreclosed homes drives down home prices overall and hurts demand for new homes. Last month, foreclosed homes sold at a 15% discount to non-distressed sales, NAR said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builder <span class="companylink">PulteGroup</span> expects 2011 to be on par with this year - - the worst for home builders in decades, says CEO Richard Dugas. Yet he says the "groundwork is laid for a recovery," because of low interest rates, low home prices, some job creation and improving consumer confidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Toll Bros</span>., the largest U.S. luxury-home builder, is "cautiously optimistic" about 2011, says CEO Douglas Yearley. Toll has spent $400 million buying land in the past year -- increasing its land bank for the first time in four years, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Job growth is the key to housing's recovery. Economist Newport expects the U.S. economy to add about 960,000 jobs this year, 2.2 million more in 2011 and 2.9 million more in 2012. But it lost 8.5 million during the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Credit for home buyers is another issue. Almost a quarter of homeowners with mortgages owe more on their homes than they're worth, making it tough to sell and move up. "Without people trading up or down, demand is limited," says Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Decatur, Ill., the soybean capital of the world, has stayed placid through the housing boom and bust. Even during the recession, when unemployment increased, home sales were mostly unruffled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our growth is about 3% a year," says Terry Smith, board treasurer of Decatur Association of Realtors. "We just don't have big swings in our market. And I've been doing this for 30 years."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Decatur, the Macon County seat, is in the central Illinois flatlands and lacks the allure of many coastal and mountain areas. That's worked in its favor, because it has avoided overbuilding and price speculation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Sales status. Because Decatur's housing market is small, minor changes can make the monthly statistics fluctuate dramatically. In September, sales in Macon County were 15.6% below September 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, home sales have been positive. Sales from January through September were up 3.5% compared with the same period last year, Smith says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The local market is on an even keel, and the home buyer tax credit didn't spark major changes. In each month of the tax credit, Decatur had only about 10 first-time home buyer sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Price points. Prices also have remained relatively stable over time. Decatur's median home price peaked at $85,400 in 2006, then fell to $83,100 in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was $88,600 in the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Local economy. Macon County is an agricultural area. Soybeans and corn are big business, but it also produces farm and construction equipment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Archer Daniels Midland</span> is the largest employer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Behind it are heavy-equipment maker Caterpillar and <span class="companylink">Tate &amp; Lyle</span>, a London-based company that makes Splenda sweetener and other food ingredients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September, the unemployment rate in Decatur was 10.9%. Illinois' rate was 9.9%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When capital investment is down, unemployment in places like Decatur goes up more than in places like Chicago that have a more mixed economy," says Edward Stuart, economics professor at Northeastern Illinois University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"And even though Decatur's unemployment is coming down a bit, it's going to be a long time before it comes back to where it was in 2006 and 2007."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Hot 'hoods. The West End Historic District is a popular area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Located close to Millikin University, it has many historic homes and mansions. But it has affordable prices, too, ranging from $50,000 to $500,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A three-bedroom home built in 1913 is listed for $59,900.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most expensive home</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This home, built in 2005, on 2.26-acre waterfront property, is on the</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Price: $2.5 million.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cleveland's real estate market is often considered middle of the road.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's slipped into reverse the past couple of years, but unlike many other cities hurt by the housing bust, Cleveland's sales and prices show neither a sudden surge nor a steep drop-off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its changes have been less dramatic. The recession and unemployment have had the most impact, causing an oversupply in homes and diminished demand. Now the local market seems to have hit bottom and stabilized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We do have a market again," says Carol Woodard, chairman of the Cleveland Area Board of Realtors. "We're not going gangbusters, but this year is better than 2009."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Sales status. Home sales in Cuyahoga County, which includes Cleveland and the surrounding suburbs, are hardly in an upswing judging from the most recent snapshot. September's sales fell 36% from a year earlier, a sluggish month following the expiration of the federal home buyers' tax credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But home sales from January through September were better than the same period last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers are starting to shop around. Of those who feel secure in their jobs, many want to take advantage of the low mortgage rates and reduced home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is activity," Woodard says. "I have buyers who need to move and buy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Price points. Prices have been going up this year. Most of the rise happened during the first six months, when buyers were willing to pay more as they rushed to take advantage of the federal tax credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Prices are coming down now," Woodard says. "We've got a lot of bang for your buck here."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As winter approaches, sellers are more willing to reduce prices because they want to unload their property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our market does freeze up along with the temperature," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September, Cuyahoga County's median sales price was $116,500, the same as in September 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price peaked at about $130,000 in 2007. Even though the metro area has suffered from home foreclosures, the distressed properties have not caused a dramatic downturn in prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Local economy. "Ohio never recovered from the 2000-2001 recession," says George Zeller, economic research analyst in Cleveland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cuyahoga County has lost nearly a fifth of its jobs over the past 10 years. The metro area has heavily relied on manufacturing, including the auto supply and steel industries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Just about one-third of manufacturing is now gone," Zeller says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The single bright spot is health services, which is growing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city of Cleveland suffered the most from 2000 to 2007. Since then, a large majority of the county's job losses have come at firms in the suburbs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September, the unemployment rate in the Cleveland-Elyria- Mentor metropolitan area was 9.4%. Ohio's rate was 10%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Hot 'hoods. Lakewood is an inner-ring suburb of Cleveland located along the cliffs of Lake Erie. It was founded in 1889 and remains desirable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It has strong activity and beautiful old neighborhoods," Woodard says. This year Lakewood was named one of the top 10 coolest suburbs worth a visit by Travel &amp; Leisure Magazine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city has many art galleries and restaurants. Homes are affordable. One updated, three-bedroom Colonial built in 1920 is listed for $137,328.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Burlington is a picturesque town that has avoided many of the pitfalls of the housing bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It trailed most of the country during the housing boom as its local real estate market remained conservative and predictable. But when the national housing market crashed, Burlington's stability turned into an asset.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It even held its own better than the rest of Vermont.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bordering Lake Champlain, Burlington is the Chittenden County seat and Vermont's largest city. "We are the power county," says Kathie Desautels, president of the Northwestern Vermont Board of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is home to the University of Vermont, Burlington College and Champlain College. Because Burlington is a large college town, rental property is in demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In our area the rents are so high that it is almost always more affordable to buy a home rather than rent," Desautels says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many parents of college students buy houses or condominiums for their children to live in while they're attending college.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Sales status. The local housing market has not been sheltered from the recession, which has slowed down many buyers. But sales started well this year because of the federal tax credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since its expiration, home sales have slowed. In September, sales in Chittenden County were 23% below September 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The local market doesn't look quite as bad when the first three quarters of the year are considered. From January through September, home sales are 3% above last year's first nine months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Even though mortgage rates are now extremely low and the stock market is doing quite well, many buyers are more cautious," Desautels says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Price points. Prices in Chittenden County have been nearly flat for three years, says Art Woolf, economist at the University of Vermont.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2008, the median home price was $259,000. This year, prices are nearly the same.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September, the county's median sales price was $260,000, which is 5% above a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Local economy. Vermont's unemployment rate is usually below the nation's, and Burlington's rate is even less. Its unemployment rate in August was 4.9%, compared to the state's 6% rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Burlington area is the commercial and financial center of the state," Woolf says. "It is the strongest part of the state's economy. And a lot of the major industries are relatively resistant to changing economic times."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the major employers in Chittenden County are Fletcher Allen Health Care, a university hospital and medical center; <span class="companylink">GE Healthcare</span>; and <span class="companylink">General Dynamics Armament and Technical Products</span>. Burlington is well known as the headquarters of Ben &amp; Jerry's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Hot 'hoods. Five Sisters is a very popular neighborhood. Many houses have been scooped up by word of mouth, before a Realtor even put them on the market, Desautels says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is because it has historic character and a small-town ambience. The homes are an eclectic mix of Cape Cods, stone bungalows and Foursquares. Many have front porches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not an affluent neighborhood. Many homes are small and very close together. One three-bedroom Craftsman-style home built in 1929 is on the market for $319,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most-expensive home</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lake Champlain waterfront Cape-style home on 1.17 acres is</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Bedrooms: 4.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Westchester County, N.Y., is along the Hudson River and close to New York City. Because it is home to many Wall Street executives, it felt much pain after the stock market's meltdown two years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was not just whether people were going to survive and have a job," says Leah Caro, president of the Westchester Putnam Association of Realtors. "Their investment portfolios also were slashed."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the local real estate market suffered as buyers and sellers froze. "In my community, between October of 2008 and March of 2009 there was not a single house sold," Caro says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Sales status. Suburban Westchester County has long been known for wealth and "old money." But that doesn't mean that everyone who lives in White Plains, the county seat, or in Westchester's small towns and villages is affluent. And homes in Westchester range from very expensive estates to more affordable single-family homes and townhouses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year the federal tax credit helped bring more first- time home buyers into the market. And low mortgage rates have kept sales moving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The paralysis has been wearing off," Caro says. "People have learned whether or not they are going to stay employed, and people always need to move, and their needs change."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the tax credit ended, sales have slowed a bit in Westchester. But the drop was not as dramatic as it was in other parts of the state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September, sales in Westchester were 2% below the same month in 2009. During the same period, New York state's home sales were down 18%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Price points. The median home price peaked at $730,000 in March 2007. Prices came down during the recession, making homes more affordable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of unemployment and subprime loans, home foreclosures increased in Westchester County, also keeping prices down. "We're seeing a fair number of short sales," Caro says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the market has not been hit as hard by distressed properties as many other parts of the nation. Home prices -- in particular, high-end home prices -- recently started to increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September, the median sales price in Westchester County of $640,000 was 10% higher than September 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The areas of the county that are farther north are less costly. In Croton-on-Hudson, for example, there are many single-family homes priced at $300,000 or less, Caro says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Local economy. In Westchester County, jobs have been improving. The unemployment rate in August was 6.9%, less than the 7.2% in August 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We were losing a lot more jobs last year," says Johny Nelson, regional labor market analyst for the state labor department. "There is still weakness in the job market, but there is a lot of optimism in the air."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although some managers are holding back on hiring, temporary hires have increased. "That could be an indication that managers are starting to feel a little more optimistic," Nelson says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many people who live in Westchester County work in New York City. But some Fortune 500 companies, including IBM and <span class="companylink">PepsiCo</span>, are major employers in the county.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When the recession started, the only industry sector that was adding any type of jobs was educational and health services," Nelson says. "Lately job growth is starting to show up in leisure and hospitality and in other services."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Hot 'hoods. "Bronxville is an old, established village, nestled next to the most cosmopolitan city in the world," Caro says. It is a big draw now because prices have come down, making homes more affordable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bronxville looks like a quaint English hamlet. Many colonial, Tudor and Victorian homes were built between 1890 and 1930.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bronxville is only 15 miles from Midtown Manhattan. Although it is largely an affluent enclave, it has a wide range of homes, including some less-expensive studio apartments. One two-bedroom condo with a fireplace, built in 1925, is on the market for $199,000.</p>

</div><div class="author">Christine Dugas    </div><div>671 words</div><div>26 October 2010</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.4</div><div>English</div><div>© 2010 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anchorage is the northernmost major city in the USA and one of the last great frontiers. Even though it's off the beaten track, its resilient economy has helped it avoid the worst of the housing bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We did not get into the real estate frenzy that a lot of other places of the country did," says Neal Fried, a state economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Anchorage has seen some home foreclosures, it has largely been spared most of the epidemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Home buyers are always expecting some great deals from short sales and foreclosure, but there is nothing there," says D'Ette Owen, president of Anchorage Board of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Sales status. Earlier this year, first-time buyers rushed to take advantage of the tax credit, sending home sales soaring. "We borrowed buyers from the future," Owen says. "It inflated the sales."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But since the credit expired, sales have slumped. September's sales in Anchorage were 23% below a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In October and November, I think we will see a little more dips," Owen says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although mortgage rates are extremely low, tighter lending requirements have slowed sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the local housing industry doesn't expect a serious downturn, in part because Anchorage has not seen a recession. Its population is still growing as people move to the area for jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Price points. Home prices have come down and are at about the same level as they were three years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the peak, the median sales price was at $350,000. In September, it was $280,000, 1% lower than in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sellers are not increasing prices because they know that many buyers cannot qualify for a mortgage under stricter requirements. Higher qualifications are making high-end homes the hardest to sell, Owen says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The high-end homes are priced at $500,000 and higher. Recently, homes that ranged from $525,000 to $550,000 were on the market for an average of 127 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the tax credit was in effect, homes priced at $225,000 or less sold like hot cakes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Now, we've seen that slow down a little," Owen says. "But I recently had one for $240,000 that sold in three days."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Local economy. "Anchorage has fared better in this recession than most other places," Fried says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among its advantages: Anchorage relies on the oil industry, which has prospered as oil prices remained relatively high, Fried says. It also has a healthy fishing industry and is home to Elmendorf Air Force Base.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturing, which was hurt in the recession elsewhere, is not a big part of the economy in Anchorage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The area has enough diversity to remain strong despite some sectors that were hurt. For example, tourism has been sluggish because Americans have less money to spend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Hot 'hoods. Hillside is one of the most distinctive and popular areas in Anchorage, Owen says. The neighborhood, in South Anchorage, provides views of the city, the inlet and Flattop Mountain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are many trails where area residents can go running, hiking and do downhill and cross-country skiing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many homes were built in the 1970s and 1980s, and the heavily wooded areas around them remain intact. The prices range from $300,000 to $700,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most expensive home</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This modern lakeside home with mountain views is on the</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Price: $2.2 million.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rory Clements is conducting a grand experiment that could be a harbinger of the next big thing in corporate computing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As chief tech systems architect for <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis Group</span>, a Los Angeles-based global real estate company, Clements has begun converting CBRE's 40,000 traditional desktop PCs into "virtual desktops."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His guinea pigs: 2,000 London-based executives, surveyors, appraisers and agents. In exchange for giving up their company- issued Windows XP desktops and laptops, Clements is giving each employee access to a virtual copy of a new, more powerful Windows 7 desktop residing in CBRE's private data center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using the latest virtualization technology from VMware, Clements can push out a Windows 7 desktop to any PC the employee happens to have handy. It could be an old office XP machine, a personally owned netbook or a computer in an Internet cafe in Kuala Lumpur, for that matter. The employee gets full access to company e-mail, databases and business applications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some top CBRE executives will even be able to access their company-issued Windows 7 virtual desktops on their smartphones and tablet PCs. If all goes well, Clements plans to roll out 3,500 more virtual desktops across Europe next year; deployment to CBRE's offices in the U.S. and other regions could follow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Giving our guys the ability to work from wherever they are, on whatever device they're on, is what this is all about," Clements says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's more, should an employee also use his or her virtual desktop to get on the public Internet, Clements will have much tighter control of repelling infections and breach attempts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revisiting thin clients</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Making private company data accessible to employees is nothing new. IBM for decades sold data centers running in monolithic mainframe computers accessible exclusively from "dumb" computing terminals. In the 1990s, <span class="companylink">Sun Microsystems</span> failed in its ambitious attempt to popularize the use of data centers running in Sun Solaris servers made accessible to employees via stripped-down computing devices, called "thin clients."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What took hold in the modern corporate workplace is a model where each employee gets a "fat client" -- a Windows PC packed with applications that is also tied in to the company's private data center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, a confluence of developments has made the time ripe for revisiting the notion of thin clients. High-speed Internet connections are ubiquitous, and employees are using popular new consumer devices -- smartphones and tablet PCs, as well as online services such as <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and Twitter -- to be more productive. A recent <span class="companylink">Cisco</span> survey, for instance, found 45% of U.S. tech pros use their smartphones for primary communications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, VMware and rival Citrix have refined virtualization technologies, prompting the giant hardware and software firms to begin pitching "virtual desktop infrastructure," or VDI systems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adoption is in the embryonic stage, so estimates of the multibillion dollars that corporations could spend on VDI in years to come aren't yet available. But all the players believe the potential is huge. Tech research firm Gartner looks at it this way: At the moment, there are roughly 600 million desktop PCs in use in large organizations globally. Some 5 million of them are in companies such as CBRE that have launched pilot studies. By 2013, there could be 50 million virtual desktops in daily workplace use.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Desktop virtualization is one of the most intriguing, hottest areas in corporate IT today," says Gartner research director Mark Margevicius.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Double-edged sword</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A catalyst that could accelerate the trend: Windows 7. Here's why:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A copy of Windows XP, Windows Vista or Windows 7 runs on 91% of all desktop PCs, according to software firm Net Applications. Many corporations are due to replace older Windows XP machines. That means they must authorize the purchase of more powerful PCs needed to run Windows 7.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many are taking a hard look at redirecting that spending to new VDI systems. CBRE, for instance, decided not to follow through on an earlier plan to replace aging XP desktops used in its U.K. offices with traditional Windows 7 desktops. Instead, it's rolling out new 24-inch Samsung monitors, called "zero clients," equipped with a power plug, a special input jack to tie into virtual copies of Windows 7 residing in private data centers -- and nothing else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clements expects zero out-of-pocket savings immediately. New PCs are dirt cheap. Setting up an all-new VDI system is not. But he expects to save big over time. The Samsung zero clients have no fans or hard drives, use minuscule electricity and should not need to be replaced for a decade, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Heeding such buzz, giant tech suppliers are hedging their bets. <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> last February, for instance, changed how it licenses new copies of Windows 7, making it easier for companies to pay to use virtual copies of Windows 7 on any platform, even a <span class="companylink">Google</span> Android phone or Apple iPad touchscreen tablet. "With VDI, we can give users a consistent Windows experience on any device," says Windows general manager Gavriella Schuster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> stands to profit big whether companies buy Windows 7 virtually or not. PC makers Dell and <span class="companylink">Hewlett-Packard</span> must deal with a double-edged sword. Each could see sales of traditional desktops erode. Yet, each could also grow sales of data-center servers and lucrative service contracts to help companies manage VDI systems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's why Dell and H-P have joined IBM, <span class="companylink">Cisco</span> and EMC in offering a menu of VDI packages combining just about whatever hardware and software components a corporate IT buyer might fancy. Says Paul Bell, president of Dell's $15 billion-a-year public sector business: "Any time you have a chance to embrace changes that are good for the customer, you've got to take it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TEXT OF INFO BOX BEGINS HERE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traditional desktop PCs</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most workplace PCs are set up to use company e-mail and other programs residing in a private data center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employees can use other types of devices to access the public Internet -- but not company e-mail</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">and other programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traditional desktops can also access the public Internet; infections occur when employees click on viral Web links.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Virtual desktop PC</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New IT systems assign each employee a "virtual" desktop that operates from inside the private data center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any type of computing device can be set up to display the employee's virtual desktop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Virtual desktops are much easier to protect from infections circulating on the public Internet.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nation's economy grew modestly in recent weeks, with nine of 12 districts expanding, according to a Federal Reserve report released Wednesday. The economic picture was mixed in the Cleveland and Richmond areas, and it weakened in the Atlanta region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the bright side, auto sales and travel and tourism perked up, and lackluster lending markets improved slightly, according to the Fed's beige book, named for the color of its cover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, the survey portrayed an economy that continued to plod along in September and early October -- after expanding fairly robustly early this year -- as many nervous businesses put off capital investment and hiring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"On balance, national economic activity continued to rise, albeit at a modest pace," it stated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturing and retail sales were up moderately, while housing and commercial real estate were still in the doldrums. The job market remained listless.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the report, which provides a ground-level snapshot of every region in the country, amounted to an improvement on the Fed's July-August survey, which showed "widespread signs of deceleration." Economists said the latest report did nothing to dampen speculation that the Fed will launch a new round of government bond purchases at its Nov. 3 meeting to lower long-term interest rates and spark the economy. Brian Bethune of IHS Global Insight anticipates $500 billion to $750 billion in purchases, less than the $1.7 trillion the Fed snapped up in late 2008 and early 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Factories continued to be a bright spot last month. Makers of semiconductors boosted output in Boston, Dallas and San Francisco. Auto production surged in the Cleveland and Chicago areas. And Chicago metal makers reported their strongest sales this year. But activity slackened in the Philadelphia and Richmond areas. And freight shipments slowed in the Cleveland and Atlanta regions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retail sales were "flat to moderately positive" in most areas. Purchases were stronger than expected in Kansas City, and back-to- school spending provided a lift in Philadelphia and Dallas. Sales of both new and used cars were robust in most regions. But traffic eased some in the Richmond and Atlanta areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Retailers said consumers are slowly regaining confidence, but remain price-conscious and were largely limiting purchases to necessities and non-discretionary items," the beige book says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The assessment was more subdued than last week's monthly retail sales report from the Commerce Department. The 0.6% jump in retail sales beat estimates, and marked the third-consecutive monthly increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturers and retailers have been hit by higher commodity and shipping costs lately but generally have not been able to pass them through to frugal customers, the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Travel, meanwhile, picked up in San Francisco as a result of a brisk business and convention trade, while Minneapolis and Kansas City saw more tourists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While hotel occupancy was still high in New York, "October bookings were somewhat weaker than expected." Atlanta was still feeling the effects of the Gulf oil spill, but that led to increased tourist activity in northeast Florida, Georgia and Tennessee. The outlook for the rest of the year was "positive."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing "remained weak." Philadelphia saw a jump in existing home sales, while Richmond, Kansas City and Dallas saw sales of higher- priced homes tick up. But Atlanta home builders cited rising foreclosures and "downward price pressure" on prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, commercial real estate rents continued to fall, though apartment leasing has picked up recently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While lenders remain tight-fisted, credit conditions improved in Chicago, and Richmond and Chicago lenders are more zealously competing for "quality loans." But demand for commercial loans was still weak as businesses put off capital spending "because of economic and public policy uncertainties."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hiring, meanwhile, was still "limited." Many firms are hesitant to hire, "given economic softness," though demand for temporary workers continued to grow in some areas. Wages were stagnant, as "firms anticipated increased costs of employee benefits as a result of health care reform."</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Living together? Time to protect your interests ; If you're not married, laws don't apply in the event of a death or breakup, so it's good to be prepared</span>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Living together outside of marriage, once associated primarily with Hollywood celebrities and libertines, has become so common that if you tell your parents you're moving in with your significant other, they'll probably roll their eyes and ask you to pass the peas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of opposite-sex couples living together jumped 13% this year to 7.5 million, according to the Census Bureau. Demographers blame the sluggish job market, which has forced many young adults to share living quarters. Broader societal issues are also at work. Researchers estimate that more than half of married couples live together before they get married. Only 38% of Americans believe that unmarried couples living together is bad for society; half said it doesn't make much difference, according to a Pew Research Center survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Young adults -- along with older adults who have been previously married -- may view living together as a way to avoid the hassles often associated with the end of a marriage. But if you and your partner share property, a breakup could be even messier than a dish- throwing divorce. "The biggest financial issue that unmarried couples face is the issue of yours, mine or ours," says Frederick Hertz, an Oakland attorney and author of Living Together: A Legal Guide for Unmarried Couples. "Marriage is a system that organizes that landscape for you. If you had it before, it's yours. If you earned it while we're together, it's ours. With unmarried couples, it's all up in the air."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if your union is happy, you need to take extra steps to protect your interests, because in many cases, the law doesn't recognize your relationship, says Larry Elkin, a financial planner and author of Financial Self-Defense for Unmarried Couples.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This may not be a big issue if you're in your 20s and sharing a studio apartment until you find a full-time job. But if you're in a long-term relationship, here are some issues that require special attention:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buying a home</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market is glutted with homes, and mortgage rates are the lowest they've ever been. But before you and your partner start attending open houses, sit down and decide how you want to own the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike married couples, the courts won't assume you have equal ownership of the house in the event of a breakup. The house will go to whoever is on the title, even if both partners put money into the home, says Theodore Connolly, a Boston bankruptcy attorney and co- author of The Road Out of Debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One option is to own the home as joint tenants with right of survivorship. This ensures that both partners own an equal share of the home. If one partner dies, the property reverts to the surviving partner -- which means your partner's disapproving relatives can't kick you out of your home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But here, too, there are risks. Suppose the relationship sours, and you decide to move out. You'll be responsible for paying the mortgage unless your ex-partner agrees to take over the payments, Connolly says. And while joint tenants have the legal right to sell their interest in the property, you'll have a tough time finding someone willing to buy half a house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To avoid a messy court battle, draw up a contract or trust that spells out how you'll handle the property in the event of a breakup, Connolly says. The side benefit to this strategy is that it forces both partners to discuss their goals and expectations. Suppose, for example, that you want to buy a home because you believe you and your partner will grow old together, while your partner wants to buy a home because she believes it's a good investment. "Neither one of you is wrong, you're just not on the same page," Elkin says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Estate planning</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everyone needs to have an estate plan, but for unmarried couples, it's essential. If you die without a will, your estate will be divided according to state law, which usually doesn't recognize domestic partners, Elkin says. Family members you haven't spoken to in years could inherit everything you own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with a will, the surviving partner could be forced to sell the home to pay federal and state estate taxes. A surviving spouse can inherit an unlimited amount of assets tax-free, but that doesn't extend to domestic partners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal estate tax expired on Dec. 31, 2009, but unless Congress acts before year's end, it will return next year with a top tax rate of 55% on estates valued at more than $1 million. A surviving partner who inherits a home, a retirement plan and other savings could easily exceed that threshold, says Sheryl Garrett, founder of Garrett Planning Network and co-author of Money Without Matrimony: The Unmarried Couple's Guide to Financial Security.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are ways to protect your estate from taxes, but you'll need help. Garrett recommends consulting an estate-planning attorney who has experience working with unmarried couples.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Health care</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most large companies let their employees add domestic partners to their health insurance. While coverage for a spouse is tax-free, the IRS doesn't recognize domestic partners. That means benefits provided for your partner are treated as taxable income, says Melissa Labant, technical manager for the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This drawback to domestic partner benefits isn't well-known, Garrett says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with the tax hit, extending group coverage to your partner is probably less expensive than buying an individual policy, Garrett says. But if you both have jobs with employer-provided coverage, you're probably better off keeping separate insurance plans, even if one partner's coverage is less generous, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You don't have to pay taxes for health care coverage if your partner is a dependent, Labant says. However, the bar for claiming a partner as a dependent is high. You must be responsible for more than half of your partner's support, and your partner can't earn income that exceeds the IRS' personal exemption for the year. For 2010, the personal exemption is $3,650.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To protect yourself from a medical catastrophe, you and your partner should draw up advanced health care directives, sometimes known as a durable power of attorney for health care. This document gives both partners legal authority to make health care decisions on each other's behalf if they're incapacitated. All couples should have one, but it's particularly important for unmarried couples, Garrett says. Without one, hospital employees may refuse to provide information to someone who isn't a spouse or relative, she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It doesn't have to be complicated or costly. Most hospitals and county health departments provide a form. For more complicated situations -- a family member might challenge the directive, for example -- you should consult an attorney, Garrett says. She recommends keeping several copies on file, along with one online, so you can get at it quickly in an emergency.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Columbia, Md., located in affluent Howard County, has not escaped the post-tax-credit blues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least home prices surged earlier this year when the home buyers' tax credit was available. There were multiple offers for some homes, says Kenny Smallwood, president of the Howard County Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But sales have dropped sharply since the tax credit expired in April, just as they have elsewhere. Real estate professionals are now hoping that it is just a temporary lull. "We just got overheated, and now we are cooling off," says John Toner, a broker with Providence Real Estate in Howard County.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Sales status. Howard County is home to many white-collar professionals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though many government workers have job security, they are not without financial worries. Some of them are earning less. And there is no question that mortgage lenders have tightened up the application process, Toner says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No wonder sales have fallen off even in the most sought after neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August, Howard County's 247 sales were 16% lower than in August 2009. And the local housing market is not close to its peak. In August 2005, 567 homes sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think the economy is part of the slowdown," Smallwood says. "People are a little more cautious, especially the first-time buyers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Price points. Howard County has not been hit as hard by home foreclosures as many other parts of the nation. But this year through Sept. 10, 20% of home sales were distressed properties, Toner says. That includes short sales and bank-owned properties. The lowest-priced homes and condos were hammered the hardest by foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is not keeping prices down. In August, the median sales price in Howard County -- $395,000 -- was 6% higher than in August 2009. But that's still less than the median price of $430,000 in August 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices might have risen higher this year if more homeowners were moving up to larger, more expensive homes. But homeowners now tend to sell only if they have to move because of a job transfer, divorce or other life changes, Toner says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Local economy. "Howard County is one of the blessed places," says Peter Morici, economist at the University of Maryland. "It has survived the recession reasonably well."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July, the county's unemployment rate was 5.7%, less than Maryland's rate of 7.6% that month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The closest employers include Department of Defense installations and the National Security Agency at the Fort Meade Army base. Fort Meade expects to add 22,000 jobs over the next five to seven years as military bases are closed or restructured.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are many other Defense, health care and high-tech jobs outside the Washington, D.C., Beltway that are within driving distance to Howard County," Morici says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, Science Applications International opened the Cyber Innovation Center in Columbia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Hot 'hoods. Columbia/Ellicott City was named the second-best place to live in the U.S. by Money magazine in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Columbia is a planned community that opened in 1967, while Ellicott City, which dates back to 1772, has many historic homes. They both offer a variety of homes and amenities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the most popular communities are Font Hill and Burleigh Manor, which are in Ellicott's Centennial High School district. It is one of the state's top-ranking public high schools, and the school drives the housing market, Toner says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One ranch home in Font Hill Manor, with three bedrooms, a deck and gazebo, is on the market for $350,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next week: Taos, N.M.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most expensive home</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This three-story colonial home, built in 1998, on a 0.24-acre landscaped yard is on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Price: $900,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Bedrooms: 4.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Helena, Mont., 4,058 feet above sea level near the Continental Divide, weathered much of the real estate storm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its status as the state capital and the Lewis and Clark County seat afforded some shelter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That brings a lot of stability in our market," says Joe Mueller, president of the Helena Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Helena metro area also was protected from a recent boom in home foreclosures because few purchases were financed with subprime and variable-rate mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Before homes fully go into foreclosure, families figure out how to take care of their problem," Mueller says. "People take a lot of pride in their financial responsibility in this part of the country. Most households have two jobs, and if they have to find a third and fourth job, they do it to resolve the situation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Sales status. Home sales have hit a snag since the expiration of the federal tax credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August, sales in the Helena metro area were 23% lower than in August 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no inventory glut now, but it takes a little longer to sell a home -- about 120 days on average, Mueller says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Price points. Helena does not attract movie actors and vacation home buyers. That's because it does not have major ski slopes like the Rocky Mountain region of Montana does.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in its favor, home prices are stable and affordable. High- end properties start at $400,000, but the normal price range is $150,000 to $300,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a small market, a few sales of expensive homes raise the median price. One home was recently sold for $920,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price in the Helena metro area in August -- $218,000 -- was 13% higher than in August 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Local economy. Helena's main employer is the state government. It also is home to quite a few hotels that host state conventions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is not by any means a commercial hub," says Patrick Barkey, director of the University of Montana Bureau of Business and Economic Research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unemployment rate in July was 7.3%, less than the national rate of 9.5% that month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Hot 'hoods. One charming neighborhood is South Central. It is a historic area between downtown and the State Capitol building where wealthy miners built properties ranging from large Victorian homes to Greek revivals. Queen Anne cottages surround the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It has tree-lined streets and historical charm with original brick sidewalks from the 1890s," Mueller says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average price range is $195,000 to $205,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most expensive home</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This log home, custom-built in 2005 on a wooded 43-acre summit, is on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Price: $2.4 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Bedrooms: 5.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Bathrooms: 4 full, 3 half.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreclosures accelerated in the second quarter, driving down home prices and accounting for nearly half of all sales in several states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, homes sold at foreclosure accounted for 24% of all residential sales in the second quarter of 2010, RealtyTrac reports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average price of properties sold while in some stage of foreclosure was more than 26% below the average for properties not in the foreclosure process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's obvious foreclosures remain a major drag across the U.S.," says Robert Dye, senior economist at <span class="companylink">PNC Financial Services Group</span>. "Pioneering buyers with low mortgage rates will continue to take advantage of these properties. It's going to take quite awhile to work through this inventory. It will take a few years, not months."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A total of 248,534 U.S. properties in some stage of foreclosure - - default, scheduled for auction or bank-owned -- were sold to third parties in the second quarter. That's up almost 5% from the first quarter, but down 20% from second-quarter 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some states were especially hard hit. Foreclosure sales accounted for nearly 56% of all sales in Nevada in the second quarter, the highest percentage of any state. Ranked second was Arizona, where foreclosure sales accounted for 47% of all sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In California, 43% of sales were foreclosure properties. Other states where foreclosures were large shares of all sales were Rhode Island, 37%; Massachusetts, 35%; Florida, 34%; and Michigan, 33%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The uptick in foreclosures comes despite a federal effort to help homeowners struggling to retain their homes get modified mortgages with more affordable payments, as well as efforts by lenders to reduce payments for some borrowers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's clear this will be with us for some time," says Lawrence Yun, chief economist with the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreclosures used to be rising because so many borrowers had taken on mortgages they couldn't afford, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The further we go, more foreclosures will be related to the job market rather than people who overstretched," Yun says. "There will be more traditional reasons for the foreclosures."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreclosure sales could pick up now that a federal tax credit for home buyers has expired, economists say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The credit gave borrowers the flexibility to bid on houses at higher prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without the credit, demand for lower-priced foreclosed homes could pick up. And that could pull down overall prices further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Prices will fall and will put more people into negative equity, which causes more people to (go into) foreclosure," says Mark Zandi at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics.com.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers are practically shrugging off the lowest mortgage rates in history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They have their reasons for hesitating to buy homes or to refinance existing mortgages, freeing up cash to spend:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eleven million residential properties are worth less than the mortgages on them. Nearly 15 million Americans are unemployed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Millions more are worried about their jobs; and still more are determined to cut their spending and pay down their debts, ignoring the siren song of cheap money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all those reasons -- and more -- rock-bottom mortgage rates so far are producing surprisingly little bang for the buck across the economy. "Anemic demand continues to hamper real (economic) growth," says housing analyst Robert Andrews of IBISWorld. "The housing market needs to find its true bottom before things can finally turn around."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales, though likely to strengthen after a terrible summer, barely register a pulse even after 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages hit a record low 4.32% earlier this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August, new home sales were running at the second-slowest pace on record and existing home sales were down 19% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Refinancing, though up since the first half of the year, isn't booming the way it did even last year, let alone in 2003 when homeowners rushed to take advantage of mortgage rates that were more than 1.5 percentage points higher than they are now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even those who do refinance are less likely to take out cash or tap savings from lower monthly mortgage payments to splurge on big- screen TVs, trips to <span class="companylink">Disney</span> World or other indulgences that help crank up economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It isn't supposed to be this way. When the Federal Reserve and financial markets push interest rates down -- as they have with considerable gusto -- the housing market and the economy are supposed to perk up. Home buyers shop for houses, then fill them with shiny new appliances. Rising demand for housing arouses the animal spirits of developers who start making plans to put up new homes, buy building materials and hire construction workers. Homeowners refinance and free up cash to spend. Economic growth starts purring again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not this time: Not after the biggest housing bust since the Great Depression. Credit is tight. Banks are wary about lending. Consumers are wary about borrowing. The hangover will take some time to cure. "It's going to take about three years to get back to normal," says Patrick Newport, U.S. economist for IHS Global Insight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Piggy banks, not ATMs</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No mistake, low mortgage rates are having some impact. Mark Zandi, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics, expects U.S. households to refinance more than $2.2 trillion worth of mortgage debt this year, yielding $20 billion worth of annual savings. "This acts like a tax cut for middle-income households," he says. But homeowners refinanced a lot more -- hitting an annual pace of $4.2 trillion -- in third-quarter 2003 when 30-year mortgage rates were at 6.06%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just three or four years ago, homeowners were using their houses like ATMs, refinancing or taking out home-equity loans to grab cash. In second-quarter 2006, for instance, homeowners holding conventional prime mortgages siphoned $83.6 billion out of their houses by taking out bigger mortgages when they refinanced, according to mortgage giant <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. Traditionally, Zandi says, homeowners have divided any savings from refinancing into thirds for increasing savings and paying down debt, home remodeling and consumption. He suspects that two-thirds of any savings is now going toward slashing debt or building savings and a third to consumption. "Not much is going to home improvement," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, households that refinance often treat their homes like piggy banks: They're plopping money in and not taking money out. <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> estimates that they took out only $8.3 billion in the second quarter of this year, down from $21.8 billion a year earlier. Just 27% of households that refinanced <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> mortgages took cash out in the second quarter of this year (compared with 84% three years earlier); 22% put cash into their homes in the second quarter -- the third-highest cash-in rate since <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> started keeping records in 1985. Sometimes they brought money to the table because their homes were underwater and they couldn't refinance otherwise, says <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> chief economist Frank Nothaft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners are also shortening the terms of their mortgages so they can build equity and pay off their mortgages faster. In the second quarter, 30% of homeowners refinancing 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages switched to 15- or 20-year mortgages, often absorbing higher monthly payments in exchange for owning their homes free and clear years earlier and saving tens of thousands of dollars in interest over the long haul.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm a lot more conservative than I was in my 20s," says Sue Reiss, 38, a global account manager for a manufacturing firm in Wilmington, Del. She refinanced her mortgage and is applying the $150-a-month savings toward paying off her house faster. "Took me about 10 years to pay off my credit card debt and start focusing on putting my financial life in order." She regrets "one too many payments to the credit card company where I couldn't even remember what I bought."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Danny Kofke, a special education teacher in Hoschton, Ga., has refinanced twice since 2006, turning his original 30-year mortgage into a 20-year and then, last year, a 15-year loan. He's paying $90 a month more than he did with his original mortgage -- but he'll finish off his mortgage 12 years early at a savings of more than $95,000. The father of two daughters, ages 6 and 3, is preparing for some whopping bills down the road: "I look at the big picture and think how nice it will be 14 years from now when my daughters are ready for college and I have no debt," says Kofke, 34, who earns $39,000 a year and has written the book How to Survive (and Perhaps Thrive) on a Teacher's Salary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've been swamped," says Alan Rosenbaum, CEO of the mortgage firm GuardHill Financial. "We're seeing a huge surge in volume (in refinancing) right now, but we're still surprised we haven't seen more come in." He suspects some homeowners are holding off in the hope that mortgage rates will drop still further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many just can't refinance</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A bigger factor is likely the lingering impact of the housing bust: Nearly one in four homes with mortgages are underwater -- more is owed on the houses than they're worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2009, the Obama administration introduced the Home Affordable Refinance Program. Under HARP, homeowners can refinance even if their mortgages are 25% higher than the value of their houses. But there are two requirements: Their mortgages must be guaranteed by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> or <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>; and the homeowners must be up to date on their monthly mortgage payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But HARP "has been less effective than it could be," Amherst Securities concluded in a report last month. James Lockhart III, then director of the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span>, predicted last year that HARP could help up to 4 million or 5 million homeowners lower their monthly house payments. But fewer than 380,000 had refinanced through HARP by the end of June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amherst Securities listed several reasons for the disappointing results: Homeowners with negative equity in their houses are struggling to come up with cash to cover closing costs. The mortgage industry, having cut jobs during the financial crisis, can't handle a surge in refinancing. Mortgage-servicing companies are reluctant to handle home loans originally underwritten by lenders that are now out of business. (Nearly a third of firms that issued mortgages in 2007 have vanished, Amherst notes.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brian Roy, 36, a technology manager in Nashua, N.H., gripes that his application to refinance a slightly underwater mortgage through HARP was rejected over a technicality involving mortgage insurance. He suspects the bank just didn't want to lower his interest rate. "I met all the criteria," he says. "They gave me the runaround for a long time. ... From their standpoint, they're probably thinking, 'This guy's paying 6 and a quarter. Why should I lower it to 4 and a half?' "</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across-the-board re-fi plan</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several analysts say the government should do more. William Gross, managing director of investment giant Pimco, caused a stir last month when he urged policymakers to "quickly engineer a refinancing opportunity for all mortgages that are current on payments" and guaranteed by Fannie or Freddie. Gross calculated that turning mortgages now at 5%, 6% or 7% into 4% mortgages could pump up to $60 billion into the economy and lift housing prices by as much as 10%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Whether it's above water or below water, it's the same house," Gross said in an interview. "There would be fewer foreclosures. There would be fewer defaults. There would be fewer empty homes. ... You'll improve the quality of the houses by keeping people in them rather than forcing them to leave."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> economist David Greenlaw earlier called such a move "slam dunk stimulus."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And economist Mark Thoma of the University of Oregon said the plan would be popular politically because it "helps the people who behaved well, not the people who screwed up and got a bad mortgage."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many mortgages are packaged into securities and sold to investors, not held by the lenders that originated them. Gross cautions: "Refinancing is not win-win. There are very vested interests, powerful interests that own these mortgages and would prefer they not be refinanced." In fact, Pimco itself, which owns tens of billions in mortgages, would take a hit if the government carried through on Gross' plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Fratantoni, vice president for research and economics at the Mortgage Bankers Association, called the massive refinancing plan a "non-starter. ... It would involve breaking a contract with the investor who's holding the existing mortgage." And so far, the Obama administration has shown little interest in pursuing it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So for now, the economy is contending with a shortage of consumers like Paul Kaye, 60, a civil servant in Sarasota, Fla., who refinanced two months ago and cut his monthly mortgage bill by more than $800.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Ahh, you ask what am I doing with the extra dough," he says. "We're eating a little better. The house is a little cooler. After a while, it just seems to get eaten up in the budget. I would like to say I'm socking it away in my 401(k) or saving it for our next world cruise, but that ain't happening."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More renters found housing unaffordable last year as incomes fell while costs increased, a one-two punch that squeezed lower-income households in particular.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Affordability for homeowners, however, was stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The share of renters spending 30% or more of their household income on housing costs -- the threshold set by the government to determine if housing is unaffordable -- rose to 51.5% from about 50% in 2008, according to 2009 Census data released Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Renters were socked by two forces. Median household income, adjusted for inflation, fell 2.9% in 2009 as unemployment rose as high as 10.2%. Meanwhile, median monthly housing costs, including rent and utilities, jumped about 3% to $842 from $818, the data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Housing affordability is being challenged by a decline in household income and by the job market," says Daniel McCue, senior research analyst at Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The higher rental costs largely reflect a surge in demand as home foreclosures and short sales led many Americans to forgo homeownership in favor of renting, McCue says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A small silver lining: The portion of homeowners with mortgages spending 30% or more of their income on housing costs -- including mortgage payments, taxes, insurance and utilities -- was 37.6%, about the same as in 2008 after rising steadily since 2002. And the median home price dropped about 6%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homeowners fell nearly 500,000 while the number of renters increased by nearly 1 million. The homeownership rate dipped to 65.9% from 66.6%. The decline came despite a tax credit for first- time home buyers that sparked more purchases, McCue notes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Renters' strained budgets hurt the economy. By setting aside a bigger chunk of their paychecks for housing, renters have less to spend on shopping, vacations and other discretionary items. Consumer spending makes up 70% of the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Renters were also more likely to be severely financially burdened last year, with 26.4% spending more than half their incomes on housing, up from 25.1% in 2008, according to McCue's analysis of the Census data. Some 9.5 million households fell into that category last year, vs. 8.8 million in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The share of renters spending 30% or more of their incomes on housing was lowest in the Columbus, Ind., metro area at 29.8%. It was highest in College Station, Texas -- 68.2%.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes improved slightly in August after a record drop in July, possibly the first step on a long road back to health.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although sales remain very weak, especially considering mortgage rates are near historic lows, some economists say August's increase may point to slow improvement over the next two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This report is only good in the context of the incredibly bad report last month," say Mark Zandi, chief economist of <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics. "But last month will be the low point in the cycle. When we look back years from now, it will be the bottom. The worst is over."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday's report from the National Association of Realtors (NAR) showed:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Existing home sales climbed 7.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.13 million units in August. That was still the second-worst month in 15 years -- behind July -- and 19% below the August 2009 sales rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Distressed homes, including foreclosures, rose to 34% of sales in August from 32% in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Prices rose slightly compared with a year ago. The national median price of $178,600 was up 0.8% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patrick Newport, an economist at IHS Global Insight, says he doesn't expect sales to worsen -- "just a long climb out of a deep hole."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The labor market is the key to recovery, Newport says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the economy adds jobs, demand for homes will improve, people will move to be near their new jobs, the supply of homes for sale will fall and more new homes will be built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That won't happen quickly. Existing home sales are unlikely to beat 6 million a year -- a normal rate -- until 2013, he predicts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales were inflated by buyer tax credits last year and earlier this year, and they fell off sharply when the credits went away in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time buyers have pulled back since then -- they bought 31% of existing homes last month compared with 38% in July, NAR reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joel Naroff, of Naroff Economic Advisors, says it may take two or three months to find out what level of sales can be sustained without tax credits and a couple of years before sales return to a decent level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Housing is not going to lead the way out of the slow-growth economy as it has in previous recoveries," he says. "Credit standards, equity losses and uncertain households should hold back demand for a while."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cheyenne, Wyo., is a frontier town where the wind blows across the high plains and antelopes roam the streets, causing traffic hazards in the winter. But one wreck it missed was the housing bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Cheyenne has been pretty fortunate," says Norm Morris, president of the Cheyenne Board of Realtors. "We haven't had big spikes."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the real estate boom, it started to become a Colorado bedroom community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Cheyenne, which is the state capital and the county seat of Laramie County, is still holding onto its past and preserving its heritage. True West magazine named it the top true West town in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Sales status. Home sales have remained fairly stable through the years. "If they increased by 4% or 5% a year, that is pretty much a top-end swing for us," Morris says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That changed a little in the first half of this year when many first-time buyers rushed to take advantage of the tax credit. After it expired and home contracts were completed, sales fell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though mortgage interest rates are low, more restrictive lending standards hold down sales. Buyers need sizable down payments and good credit scores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July, 65 homes were sold in Laramie County, down 48% from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's unclear if the local market will start to pick up soon, but it appears that August home sales did not drop more than July's, Morris says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Price points. Wyoming has had one of the lowest foreclosure rates in the nation. Last year, it ranked 45 out of 50 states, according to RealtyTrac.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the second quarter of 2010, foreclosure filings increased. Although there have been some home foreclosures and short sales in Cheyenne, they have not pulled down prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national news about the housing collapse has had more impact. "Home buyers are pretty smart people, and they are looking for the best buy," Morris says. "Sellers know that if they don't have a home priced well, then it is just going to sit there."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July, the median sales price -- $173,500 -- was 3% lower than a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Local economy. Cheyenne's economy has withstood the recession better than other areas. Its unemployment rate was 6.9% in July, compared with the national rate of 9.5%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has very little manufacturing and is not economically diverse, says Rob Godby, University of Wyoming economics professor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The oil and gas industry forms its economic base, and, fortunately, "The energy and resource sector has been coming back," Godby says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cheyenne also has job stability because it is the state capital and the F.E. Warren Air Force Base is nearby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cheyenne is trying to create itself as a regional center of economic development. <span class="companylink">Lowe's</span> and <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span> have opened regional distribution centers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has been selected for a National Center for Atmospheric Research Supercomputing Center. This summer, construction started on a $70 million facility, and research should start in 2012. The partners include the University of Wyoming and Cheyenne Light, Fuel and Power.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Since it won the contract, we're seeing a few companies announcing plans to open data-storage centers here," Godby says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Hot 'hoods. Cheyenne continues to preserve the city. Last year, Moore Haven Heights was designated as a historic district. It's an upscale neighborhood that has many Tudor-brick homes from the 1920s and 1930s and ranch homes built in the 1940s and 1950s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It features narrow streets and well-manicured lawns and joins several other historic districts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One historic home on the market for $259,000, which was built in 1920, has three bedrooms and vintage charm with a gas fireplace, hardwood floors and crown molding.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lafayette, Ind.'s metro area housing market is ending the summer on a sour note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home buyer tax credit stimulated home sales before it ended, but then sales went into a tailspin. "The tax credit helped us, but we were really borrowing from future sales," says Maggie Stark, president of the Lafayette Regional Association of Realtors. It's unclear if the slump will continue for the rest of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Lafayette metro area, which includes Purdue University in West Lafayette, has a positive sign: Many people who moved there in the past two years rented homes if they only planned to stay several years, Stark says. "But this year they are definitely looking to purchase," she says. "There seems to be a little light at the end of the tunnel."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Sales status. Lafayette, the Tippecanoe County seat, had a boom in housing construction in 2004. But that did not create a major bubble. It mostly caused sales to flatten, Stark says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax credit helped turn things around, attracting many first- time buyers. And those sales may now open up the sellers to the next level of homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High-end homes, $300,000 and above, were not moving in 2009. But this year the sales are up slightly, and those in the $300,000 to $400,000 range have improved more, Stark says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If that continues, the drop in sales may be temporary. In July, home sales were 27.5% lower than a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Price points. Home prices have tended to remain stable in the Lafayette metro area even through market storms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2005, the median price has been in the mid-$120,000s, Stark says. In July, the median sales price -- $126,250 -- was 0.6% higher than a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases by first-time home buyers brought down the median price somewhat earlier this year. Fatigued sellers, those who lowered their prices a good while after they first put their homes on the market, had some effect, too, Stark says. But most sellers are not in financial distress and prefer to keep their homes rather than lower their prices sharply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Local economy. Unemployment has been higher than the national rate because the metro area's economy is based on manufacturing. Lafayette's unemployment rate was 10.2% in June, the same as the state's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Caterpillar plant, which makes large engines, cut about 500 of its 1,900 jobs last year. This year, it has recalled about 300 and is still rehiring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Lafayette was hard hit by the recession, but it is improving," says Morton Marcus, an economist who retired from Indiana University's Kelley School of Business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subaru of Indiana Automotive in Lafayette, which makes Outback sport-utility vehicles and Legacy sedans, is operating at a good level, he says. Purdue University provides some stability to the local economy, but perhaps not as much as before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Even the university has faced some job cutbacks, and it is talking about giving early retirement for faculty and staff," Marcus says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Hot 'hoods. Arbor Chase, a planned community near Purdue, is a relatively new subdivision in West Lafayette that attracts families and empty nesters. It has a picnic and playground area, walking and jogging trails, and a pond and a lake with a fountain. Arbor Chase offers a variety of homes, from high-end executive homes to townhouses that provide lawn care and snow plowing for a fee, Stark says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A five-bedroom home with a designer kitchen in Arbor Chase is priced at $449,900.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Home prices rose in June as tax credit built traffic ; With high supplies, a drop of up to 8% forecast by 2011</span>
</div><div class="author">Stephanie Armour   </div><div>466 words</div><div>1 September 2010</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.3</div><div>English</div><div>© 2010 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices rose slightly in June as the tail end of a federal housing tax credit helped bolster demand, but high supplies of unsold homes threaten further gains in coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices rose 1% in June compared with May in 20 major cities tracked by the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller index, S&amp;P reported Tuesday. The index reflects three-month moving averages, so the latest report captures prices at the end of the now-expired tax credit's eligibility period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The credit was the major driver behind an increase in home sales in the spring, but both new and existing home sales plunged in July, according to other recent reports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People were competing for homes. If I was selling a house in that market, I'd raise my price," says Paul Dales, an economist at Capital Economics. "It's only a matter of time before prices fall, and fall back quite sharply."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Future reports may show home prices rose in July and August but they will fall as much as 8% before bottoming out in 2011, says Patrick Newport of IHS Global Insight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices rose in June from May in 17 of the 20 metro areas in the Case-Shiller index, and they were higher than a year ago in 15 cities. Year over year, the index was up 4.2%. June marked the third consecutive month of increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices are now 3.6% higher than they were in June 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the second quarter, home prices nationally rose 4.4%, more than offsetting a 2.8% decline in the first quarter. But from its peak in mid-2006, the 20-city index is down 28.4%. Nationally, average home prices are back to where they were in autumn 2003, according to Case-Shiller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in home prices does reflect a housing market that is in better shape than at this time last year, says David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>. But if housing demand stays weak, coupled with high inventories of unsold homes, "It will likely filter through to home prices in coming months," Blitzer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California, one of the states hit hardest by the housing bust, is now showing improving prices. Three of its cities had some of the best year-over-year gains, according to Case-Shiller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices in San Francisco were up 14% in June vs. June 2009, 11% in San Diego and 9% in Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Las Vegas, as it has for months, still has falling prices -- down 0.6% from May and down 5% from June 2009.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Rockville, Md. ; Proximity to Washington, D.C., helps keep market in check</span>
</div><div class="author">Christine Dugas </div><div>579 words</div><div>31 August 2010</div><div>USA Today</div><div>USAT</div><div>FINAL</div><div>B.2</div><div>English</div><div>© 2010 USA Today.  Provided by ProQuest Information and Learning.   All Rights Reserved.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rockville, Md., is so close to Washington, D.C., that it has escaped the worst of the housing bust and the recession. Federal government jobs are so resilient that they have provided a buffer against the economic downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That doesn't mean that Rockville, the Montgomery County seat, has been sheltered from the ups and downs in the housing market. Like the national market, its home sales recently plunged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Sales status. Home sales in Montgomery County rose each month in the first half of the year as buyers rushed to nail down a contract before the federal tax credit expired.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deadline forced some buyers to move faster than they might have otherwise, and now sales have slowed, says Shelly Murray, president of the Greater Capital Area Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tighter lending policies and more conservative spending by consumers are also putting the brakes on purchases, Murray says. July's home sales fell 22% from July 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Price points. Home prices are holding up better partly because home foreclosures have not been as numerous in Rockville as elsewhere in Maryland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices were down slightly every month from January through June. In July, the median sales price -- $383,000 -- was 2% higher than a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Local economy. In Rockville and in Montgomery County, jobs have weathered the recession because federal government services are the center of the economy, says Stephen Fuller, director of the George Mason University Center for Regional Analysis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rockville is home to the National Institutes of Health, and there also are many biotech jobs nearby. Metro-area residents commute to Washington, where many work in federal contractor jobs, Fuller says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low unemployment helps drive the housing market, he says. Families can afford to buy a home because they tend to have two wage earners with good jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rockville's metro area, which includes Bethesda and Frederick, had a 5.8% unemployment rate in June, below the state's rate of 7.1%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">*Hot 'hoods. The Village at King Farm is an award-winning, planned community in Rockville that has been popular since its founding in 1997, Murray says. Now that prices have dropped, its condos, townhouses and single-family houses are even more desirable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a town within a town that offers many amenities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They have their own newspaper, clubs, retail shopping and a shuttle bus to the Metro," Murray says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price of a four-bedroom home in King Farm was reduced by $15,100 earlier this month, to $739,900.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most expensive home</p>
