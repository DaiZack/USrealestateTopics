<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The declining fortunes of the middle class in New York City are often most easily observed in the context of gentrification and soaring real estate valuations. There is an obvious doom that befalls anyone renting long-term in a neighborhood on a rapid trajectory to preciousness. This doom, or fear of it, in turn leads to an intensified idealization of homeownership -- though the ownership rate in the city, at just over 30 percent, is less than half the figure for the country over all -- a sense that there could be few problems immune to solution had one had the foresight (and resourcefulness) to a buy a brownstone in Brooklyn for $400,000 in 1995.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A vivid counterargument to this wisdom is available to anyone visiting the offices of the Home Energy Assistance Program. HEAP, as it is known, is a national, federally funded program begun in the 1980s and intended in large part to help those with low incomes pay their home heating bills. In this city, where most tenants do not pay for heat, the beneficiaries are often property owners, whom we tend to consider beyond the realm of assistance. Their bills, during this winter of the polar vortex, have obviously soared; close to 750,000 HEAP payments have been issued in the city so far this winter. But funding for the program has been cut over the last few years: In 2013, the state received $350 million for the program, down from $524 million in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York, the program is run by the city's Human Resources Administration, which leaves HEAP, in many cases, a first and isolated point of contact between the homeowning class and a social service system meant to aid the poor. On a particularly cold day last week, I visited the HEAP office in Downtown Brooklyn, which is in the back of a long, narrow room in the National Grid building, where those struggling with utility costs come to pay or negotiate bills. Applicants must prove that they meet the program's income requirements, and if they do, the benefits come through fairly quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Virtually all the people I spoke with refused to allow their names to be published, in each instance out of an overwhelming feeling of shame. One man, who owns a three-story townhouse in Prospect-Lefferts Gardens that he bought 17 years ago, began to suffer reversals after the crash of the financial markets in 2008, he told me. His work as a branding and marketing consultant in SoHo had fallen away; his wife is a dental hygienist, and one of his two children has special needs, so he often has to stay home. A few years ago, he converted his house to natural gas to reduce heating costs, but that still left him with a $700 heating bill for December, he said, and he could not even begin to imagine the bill for January. He had applied for the first time last year and qualified. (To be eligible, a household of four cannot have a gross monthly income over $4,182.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A woman who said she was Pakistani and an aesthetician had a house in Bay Ridge that she bought at the height of the market. Her husband was out of work and she felt she could no longer continue to ask her children for help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another woman I spoke with over the phone, who asked to be identified only by her first name, Barbara, said she received a HEAP subsidy toward the end of January for a house she has owned in Greenpoint for more than 40 years. In her 70s, she has tried and failed to find work in office support after losing her job several years ago. Her husband, who had been a photographer, died years ago. Until mid-January, when the cold became too excruciating, she used space heaters, telling her friends that her boiler had broken. An oil company was suing her, she told me, because of unpaid bills from last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I asked this woman why she didn't take in a tenant, and she said her house needed too many repairs and she couldn't afford to create an apartment. Her real estate taxes were lower, she said, than what she would have to pay if she rented an apartment. Even if you don't tend toward an Ayn Randian view of things, it seems legitimate to ask why, under these sorts of circumstances, someone might not choose to cash out and move to Miami. At the same time, you cannot forge public policy on the deranged notion that the struggling simply evacuate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HEAP ultimately illuminates the odd complexities of middle-class existence in New York and the problems that arise when real estate is the only significant asset a family holds. It raises questions, too, of whether and how much we want to differentiate absolute from relative need, and how we approach the distinctions. On Thursday, the federal government allocated an additional $454 million to the program because of this year's cold weather. In New York, some of that money will go to people whose real estate assets are worth hundreds of thousands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One consequence of ever-diverging social inequality is that it has made us so acutely attuned to the differences between the 0.01 percent and everyone else. But it's worth remembering that there are many rungs on the ladder between the owner of the $35 million townhouse and the ground.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The American economy finished 2013 on a healthy note, buoyed by strong consumer spending along with an improved trade picture, spurring hopes that the momentum would continue into this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At an annual rate of 3.2 percent, the growth in the fourth quarter was a deceleration from the pace of expansion in the summer, the Commerce Department said, but was still well above the anemic growth of the first half of last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy was weighed down early in 2013 by the effects of the tax increases and federal spending cuts imposed by Washington, but it surprised many experts by then shrugging off much of the impact of the government shutdown and debt ceiling standoff in the autumn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the headwinds from federal austerity now easing, many economists hope some of the momentum from the second half of 2013 will continue through 2014. For all of 2013, the economy expanded 1.9 percent, well below the 2.8 percent the previous year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘What’s encouraging is that consumer spending and business investment improved, showing healthier underlying growth in the economy,’’ said Michelle Meyer, senior United States economist at <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span><span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span>. ‘‘The fundamental story for 2014 is still positive.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the headline number was encouraging, the details of Thursday’s report neatly illustrate the crosscurrents that have been buffeting the economy, and have prevented it from achieving more sustained gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although consumer spending rose 3.3 percent in October, November and December, up from a 2 percent increase in the third quarter, government expenditures plunged 12.6 percent amid the shutdown and automatic budget cuts imposed by Congress at the start of 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, the government pullback lowered fourth-quarter growth by 0.9 percentage point, with the shutdown itself shaving off 0.3 percentage point. In addition, the residential housing sector was a source of weakness, cutting overall growth by 0.3 percentage point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of that drop was weather-related, as construction activity halted, but it also represents a slowing of housing gains as mortgage interest rates rose and the sector’s post-recession rebound cooled. The fourth quarter of 2013 was the first time that housing was a drag on overall growth since 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As was the case in the third quarter, inventory additions by businesses lifted growth, adding 0.4 percentage point. Those stockpiles will most likely be drawn down in the first quarter of 2014, slowing the expansion slightly in the current quarter, economists said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trade picture continued to improve, as exports rose strongly while imports merely inched up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘It’s a pretty solid report with a big burst in consumption at the end of the year, a big narrowing in the trade deficit and some weakness in housing,’’ said Julia Coronado, chief economist for North America at <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fourth-quarter number, which was the Commerce Department’s first estimate of the economy’s performance in the period, was roughly equivalent to economists’ expectations. Government statisticians will revise the growth number two more times in the coming months as more data comes in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also Thursday, the Labor Department said weekly applications for unemployment benefits rose by 19,000 last week to 348,000, the highest level in about a month. But the broader trend in applications remains low. The four-week average, a less volatile measure, increased by just 750 to 333,000. The increase follows three consecutive weeks of declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separate data showed that fewer Americans signed contracts to buy previously occupied homes in December. Pending home sales fell to the lowest point since October 2011. The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said its seasonally adjusted pending home sales index dropped 8.7 percent last month to 92.4.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just six weeks ago, economists had expected fourth-quarter growth to be in the vicinity of 1.5 percent, but they were pleasantly surprised by healthy gains in consumer spending as the year drew to a close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the overall numbers for the second half of 2013 are encouraging, they still mask big challenges that the economy faces. Total nonfarm payrolls in the United States are still more than one million below where they were immediately before the recession, even after nearly four years of slow recovery and a modest pickup in hiring more recently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while the unemployment rate has fallen substantially in the last 12 months, to 6.7 percent in December, much of that drop has been caused by workers dropping out of the labor force rather than finding jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘Everybody agrees that with each progressive quarter and year, it is getting better,’’ said Guy Berger, the United States economist at <span class="companylink">Royal Bank of Scotland</span>. ‘‘But without a meaningful increase in employment, it makes it difficult to power strong growth in the future.’’</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street's latest trillion-dollar idea involves slicing and dicing debt tied to single-family homes and selling the bonds to investors around the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That might sound a lot like the activities that at one point set off a global financial crisis. But there is a twist this time. Investment bankers and lawyers are now lining up to finance investors, from big private equity firms to plumbers and dentists moonlighting as landlords, who are buying up foreclosed houses and renting them out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest company to test this emerging frontier in securitization is <span class="companylink">American Homes 4 Rent</span>. The company talked to prospective investors at a conference in Las Vegas last week about selling securities tied to $500 million of debt, according to people briefed on the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">American Homes 4 Rent</span>, which went public in August, has tapped <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span>, <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> and <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> as its bankers for a debt deal that is expected to be sold by the end of the first quarter, these people said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While this securitization market is still in its infancy, a recent Wall Street estimate put potential financing opportunities for the single-family rental industry as high as $1.5 trillion. Already some members of Congress and economists are worried about another credit bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The investment and lending opportunities are immense and perhaps just beginning,'' Jade Rahmani, a real estate analyst with Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, wrote in a recent report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In just the last two years, large investors have bought as many as 200,000 single-family houses and are now renting them out, according to the K.B.W. report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The private equity giant <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group</span> sold the first single-family rental securitization of its kind last fall, a $479 million bond, attracting six times as many investors as the private equity firm could accept, a person involved in the deal said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors like mutual funds and insurance companies bought slices of the bond, which are backed by the rental homes owned by <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span>'s company, Invitation Homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rental business is still dominated by landlords who own and manage only a handful of properties. Wall Street has found a way to finance them, too. <span class="companylink">Cerberus Capital Management</span> and <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> have started businesses that lend to small-time and medium-size investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there are discussions about bundling many of these small loans and securitizing them also.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's the part of the business that will take off,'' said Stephen D. Blevit, a lawyer at Sidley Austin. ''Providing cheap financing to mom-and-pop investors who save their pennies, buy a few properties and do all the maintenance themselves.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What the new securitization boom will mean for homeowners and renters is less clear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street may be clamoring to lend to investors in single-family homes, but it is still difficult for millions of Americans to qualify for a mortgage. The easy financing could give investors the upper hand in bidding for homes on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representative Mark Takano, Democrat of California, whose district includes the Inland Empire just east of Los Angeles, which was hit by a tidal wave of foreclosures, has asked the <span class="companylink">House Financial Services Committee</span> to hold hearings on the impact that single-family rental bonds could have on the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Proper oversight of new financial innovation is key to ensuring we don't go down the same road of the unchecked mortgage-backed security and create an unsustainable bubble that will wreak havoc when it bursts,'' Mr. Takano said in a letter to the committee last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Securitization, however, could provide a pick-me-up to Wall Street's mortgage machine, a once-mighty profit engine that has never fully recovered from the financial crisis. Bankers estimate that single family-rental bond deals could total as much as $7 billion this year and eventually grow to about $20 billion a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For landlords like <span class="companylink">American Homes 4 Rent</span>, securitizing debt would provide them with more leverage to buy more homes. It would also increase their profits by lowering their borrowing costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With securitization, landlords could in theory put as little as 25 percent of equity into their properties, while borrowing the rest. Credit lines from banks typically require 40 percent equity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, economists at the Federal Reserve warned that if large landlords took on too much debt, they might feel pressure to hold fire sales of their properties, flooding the housing market with supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Financial stability concerns may become more significant should debt financing become more prevalent or if the share of homes owned by investors in certain markets rises significantly further,'' the Fed economists wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They added that it was important to monitor the emergence of single-family rental securitization for signs that it could destabilize ''financial markets.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, though, companies like <span class="companylink">American Homes 4 Rent</span> are earning their early investors big profits. Many tenants used to own the houses they are now renting from the company, said a person with knowledge of the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokesman for the company, which owns 21,000 homes, did not return calls requesting comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company, whose executives are based in Agoura Hills, Calif., started out with little leverage when it began buying homes as a private venture founded by B. Wayne Hughes with money from the <span class="companylink">Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation</span> in the summer of 2012, said the corporation's executive director, Michael J. Burns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Alaska fund draws money from royalties paid by big oil companies and doles out annual dividend checks to every state resident. Last year, those checks totaled $900 each.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Burns said his investment staff had heard Mr. Hughes was buying foreclosed and other inexpensive houses as part of a private venture. Mr. Hughes, who founded the company <span class="companylink">Public Storage</span> and is listed on the Forbes 400 richest Americans, agreed to meet the Alaska investment team at his office in Malibu, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Wayne said he thought this was the biggest real estate opportunity of his lifetime,'' Mr. Burns recalled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With an initial $250 million investment from Alaska in the summer of 2012, Mr. Hughes's fund went on a buying spree in Arizona, California and Nevada. <span class="companylink">American Homes 4 Rent</span> now rents out houses in 22 states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company is a real estate investment trust, a structure that has tax advantages over other companies but tends to borrow heavily. Mr. Burns says leverage is ''a fact of life'' for a company like this. Alaska's equity investment of $625 million in the company has gained about 17 percent in value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have been very pleased with how this turned out,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Burns said that it had been ''heart wrenching'' at times acquiring homes that families have had to turn over to the bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Some other family is going to move in and make it their home,'' he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHILADELPHIA — The city that once boasted that no building would be higher than William Penn’s hat atop City Hall is getting a new skyscraper, to be the city’s tallest and more than twice as high as the iconic statue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plans for the building, the <span class="companylink">Comcast</span> Innovation and Technology Center, were announced this month. The design calls for a height of 1,121 feet reaching above central Philadelphia, beyond the existing <span class="companylink">Comcast Center</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 59-story building, on Arch Street between 18th and 19th Streets, four blocks from City Hall, will be adjacent to the company’s current headquarters. It will include some 1.5 million square feet of space for rent, of which 1.28 million will be for offices. Construction is to begin this fall, and it is scheduled for completion in 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Comcast</span>, owner of <span class="companylink">Comcast Cable</span> and NBCUniversal, will take 75 percent of the office space, which will house technical staff members such as software developers and engineers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building, designed by the British architect Norman Foster, will be the eighth-tallest in the United States. Its top will be some 650 feet below that of New York’s new One World Trade Center which, at 1,776 feet, is the tallest in the United States. (The Penn statue stands just 548 feet above street level.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some commercial real estate professionals welcomed the project as a major boost for the local office market, and for the city’s economy over all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It just shows there is significant demand in the marketplace,” said Michael Silverman, managing director in the Philadelphia office of Integra Realty Resources, a real estate and valuation consulting firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the last 12 to 18 months, demand has been rising for the 53 million square feet of office space in the Center City area of Philadelphia, pushing rents up and vacancy rates down, said Mr. Silverman, whose company has no connection with the new building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The vacancy rate for Class A office space in the Market West section of downtown Philadelphia, where the new building is to be located, has dropped slightly, to 12.2 percent from 12.7 percent at the end of 2012, Mr. Silverman said. The average asking price for commercial space has risen to $27.84 a square foot from $27.16 in 2012, he said, citing data from CoStar, a commercial real estate information company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He predicted that the large addition of office space would not drive down local office prices, because <span class="companylink">Comcast</span> employees would occupy three-fourths of the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But David M. Scolnic, a real estate lawyer with the Philadelphia firm of <span class="companylink">Hangley Aronchick Segal Pudlin &amp; Schiller</span>, said the new supply would be likely to stabilize or even drive down rents, as well as shift perceptions about what constituted a “trophy” building in the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the new building and the existing <span class="companylink">Comcast</span> headquarters will be sought after as prestigious corporate locations, others with older facilities are likely to lose their appeal as the most desirable premises, Mr. Scolnic predicted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Observers believe that there’s a shortage of large blocks of space in those buildings,” he said. “I think that’s exaggerated, and I think this building will bring people back to reality because there is a general contraction still of big users of those spaces and there are now quite a lot of floors being made available.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, he predicted rents would come under pressure in one building, currently seen as being in the “trophy” category, where <span class="companylink">Comcast</span> has some of its employees. They will be moving out when the new offices are built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s going to put pressure on those landlords to get more realistic about some of their expectations,” Mr. Scolnic said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the influx of young technology employees to a building designed by a prestigious international architect is likely to encourage boosters of a city that has long harbored an inferiority complex because it lacks either the financial power of New York or the political clout of Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This new development really speaks to a more favorable outlook for the city,” Mr. Silverman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $1.2 billion building will create 20,000 direct and indirect jobs during construction, adding $2.75 billion to the local economy, according to Gov. Tom Corbett of Pennsylvania, who announced the project, along with <span class="companylink">Comcast</span> officials, on Jan. 15.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project, 80 percent of which will be owned by <span class="companylink">Comcast</span> and 20 percent by the developer <span class="companylink">Liberty Property Trust</span>, is expected to create some 2,800 permanent jobs in the city.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the hectic days that followed Hurricane Sandy, the only place that John Ambrosini could find cell service was on a hill near his home on the North Shore of Long Island.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There he would sit, his phone plugged into the car lighter -- the only available source of electricity -- and run operations overseeing some 60 Manhattan office buildings, many of which were without power and inundated by corroding floodwaters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Sandy took us all by surprise; we were really unprepared,'' said Mr. Ambrosini, the head of property management at <span class="companylink">ABS Partners Real Estate</span>, which manages some seven million square feet in New York. ''There was no food, no ability to shelter in place, no traffic lights. And there I was stuck at home, trying to coordinate getting contractors, electricians and plumbers in and out of the buildings to pump the basements and get the systems up and running again.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the mayhem receded, Mr. Ambrosini began to rethink his preparedness for future disasters. In particular, he wanted to make sure that those whose job it was to run the buildings during a disaster were outfitted with sufficient food and protection to do their tasks effectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result is a 21-piece survival kit that ABS has begun installing in many of its buildings, including 44 Wall Street in the financial district and 210 11th Avenue in Chelsea, which were particularly hard-hit by flood damage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The kits include gallons of distilled drinking water, which has a longer shelf life than typical bottled water; military-grade food rations that have high caloric value if not much taste; and rubber suits to protect underclothes. Depending on how many people need them, these survival kits can cost $4,500 to nearly $7,000 apiece.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All of the material is of the best quality. It is stuff that is durable and won't just be useful during a storm but can be reused for the next disaster,'' said Steven Mark Palladino, the president of SMP Supply Corporation, which provided all of the items in the <span class="companylink">ABS Partners</span> kits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Palladino, who is 21 and in his final semester of college at the State University of New York Maritime College, is also a member of the Air National Guard, where he serves as an Air Force emergency manager. ''Being in the military, I know what it is like to sleep in a pile of mud and not have any assistance,'' Mr. Palladino said. He used that background to guide decisions on what to put inside the kits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A priority was hygiene, and he outfitted the kits with miniature toothbrushes and toothpaste, shampoo, razors and shaving cream. ''It is very easy to get sick when you are surrounded by so much nastiness, sitting in your own sweat or freezing cold,'' Mr. Palladino said. The kits also include enough clothes to last several days, emergency cots, heavy-duty work gloves, a multiuse tool, batteries, a first aid kit, flashlights, battery-powered radios, sump pumps, boots, a generator, bleach, five-gallon gas drums, duct tape and even a closet with a lock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">ABS Partners</span> was not the only management company that revised disaster preparedness after Sandy. For Ken Walsh Jr., the director of operations at Adams &amp; Company, which manages 33 Manhattan office buildings, the realization came when his men were stuck living without electricity for a week. ''We always kept a go-bag, but it had just enough equipment to last a few days. No one expected they would need it for a week.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the storm, Adams &amp; Company requested that its building managers expand their go-bags to include glow sticks that could be cracked and used to light stairwells, blankets, extra clothes and a lot of drinking water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joe Toledo, who works for Adams, manages a staff of nine at 53 West 23rd Street, a complex of three buildings between Fifth and Sixth Avenues. During the storm, ''there was no electricity at all and my guys were using pails to take the water out of the basement and dump it in the street,'' he said. ''We ran out of things and stuff stopped working, like batteries. You don't think about how dark a basement gets when there aren't lights.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Toledo has since filled his go-bag with, among other things, a week's supply of canned food like tuna fish and soup, wash cloths, socks and a hand-cranked radio with flashlight. The building complex has also installed a 5,500-watt portable generator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential buildings are also improving their plans for the next disaster. Halstead Management Company, which oversees 174 residential condominiums, cooperatives and rentals in New York, has created a workbook for its buildings' staff. The 31-page workbook, which includes checklists and procedures to follow, was the result of an internal task force that spent five months researching the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We contacted sources like the Coast Guard and the New York City Office of Emergency Management to figure out what was needed,'' said Paul Gottsegen, the president of Halstead, which had 42 buildings without power and six buildings that flooded during Sandy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The task force's resulting requirements are less comprehensive than the survival kits some of the large office buildings are employing. ''We found that you can be prepared with the basics for about $1,500,'' Mr. Gottsegen said. Among the items the company requires are face masks, goggles, markers and poster board for making signs, plywood sheets, buckets, shovels and inflatable mattresses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are also some homegrown attempts to put in place emergency systems around New York. Lili Gross Barasch, a real estate broker at Stribling and the vice president of the co-op board at 135 East 71st Street, is part of the Community Coalition for Emergency Preparedness, a local nonprofit organization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group hopes to create clusters of five to 10 apartment buildings that are near one another and can cooperate in case of an emergency. While goals are not final, the group may collect residents' emergency contact information, stockpile supplies and train some residents to help in an emergency. So far, two clusters have formed -- one around Carnegie Hill and another around 72nd Street, Ms. Barasch said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever the strategy, vigilance and self-reliance are critical. ''People think of this storm as once in a century, but climate change means that these storms are going to be more frequent,'' Mr. Ambrosini said. ''New York has this wonderful waterfront, but we are also extremely vulnerable and the real estate industry has to be thinking of how it can protect itself.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON — Sales of new single-family homes fell more than expected in December, but lean inventories and steady price gains suggested the housing market recovery remained intact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists did not appear to be too concerned about the second monthly decline in home sales, attributing it to frigid weather in parts of the United States. Home sales for the full year hit their highest level since 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s cold out there for the economy,” said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at <span class="companylink">Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi</span> UFJ. “The drop in new-home sales is not a sign the economy at large is starting to slow in a worrisome manner.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department reported on Monday that new-home sales fell 7 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 414,000 units. Sales were at a 445,000-unit pace in November and economists had expected them to slow to only a 457,000-unit rate in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apart from the bitterly cold weather, last month’s decline in sales was most likely a continuation of a slowdown after October’s outsize 14.9 percent increase. Sales in the Northeast, which was hard hit by cold weather, tumbled 36.4 percent to their slowest pace since June 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales are usually weak during the winter, but a cold snap last month could have exaggerated the scale of the slowdown. New-home sales stumbled in the summer after mortgage rates jumped, but economists said a lack of supply could also be curbing activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There has been some pause in sales, some of that may be supply-related rather than demand-related,” said Samuel Coffin, an economist at <span class="companylink">UBS</span>. “If you look at the inventory data for new and existing homes, they don’t look consistent with a big falloff in demand.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, the supply of houses on the market fell 2.8 percent to 171,000 units. That was the lowest since July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At December’s sales pace it would take five months to clear the supply of houses on the market. That was up from 4.7 months in November. A supply of six months is considered healthy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing is expected to have contributed significantly to economic growth last year, through residential investment and rising home prices that have increased the net worth of households, allowing for greater discretionary spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We expect new home sales activity should pick up in the coming year along with improving economic growth,” said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo Securities</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all of 2013, a total of 428,000 new single family homes were sold, a 16.4 percent increase from 2012. The median price of a new home last month rose 4.6 percent from December 2012. For the year as a whole, prices were up 8.4 percent, the most since 2005.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deadbeat Tenant</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We have holdover tenants whose lease expired over two years ago and who remain on a month-to-month basis. They have been unable to pay the rent in full for several months, and we asked them to move out, giving them a 30-day notice. But they refuse to leave and are not paying any rent. What are the landlord's rights when there is no lease?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Glen Cove, New York</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news: If a tenant is on a month-to-month rental agreement, you can terminate the agreement with 30-day notice for any reason. The bad news: If the tenant really wants to drag this process out for months, he probably can.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a good start that you've already served the tenant with a notice to vacate. Make sure you serve the notice properly -- by following relevant real property-related statutes. Don't just drop the notice in the mailbox. If the tenant hasn't left after 30 days, you can take him to court and start a holdover proceeding. Ask the court for an order of use and occupancy so you can continue to collect money during the eviction process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brace for a fight. ''If you have an aggressive tenant who is well versed at gaming the system, they can drag it out for months or longer,'' said Eric D. Sherman, a real estate lawyer. ''Clever tenants and clever lawyers can find ways to delay things.'' But if the original lease provided for lawyer fees, you might eventually be able to recoup your legal fees, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Can the Parents Pay the Rent?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When my stepdaughter graduates next year from <span class="companylink">New York University</span> and looks for an apartment in New York City, I plan to subsidize her rent. I'd be willing (and financially able) to sign, or co-sign, the lease. My credit score and income are such that anyone in the outside world would be happy to have me sign a lease for $1,800 to $2,000 a month. But I live and work in Massachusetts, and my reading of the current environment in New York suggests that finding an apartment with a landlord willing to allow a guarantor is not going to be easy. What would be the best way to help her find an apartment?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Worcester, Mass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Your stepdaughter is lucky to have such a generous (and financially able) parent, as astronomical New York City rents can be a hurdle for a recent graduate. And luckily for you, she's not the only one with a parent willing to foot the bill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Most owners and landlords and developers are fine with guarantors,'' said George Arana, a broker with Halstead Property who estimates that half of his rental clients have co-signers. ''It's more insurance for them. Why rent to someone who is young and just started a job when you could have Daddy or Mommy cover it?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although a landlord would probably prefer a guarantor who lived in New York, the fact that you live in Massachusetts isn't any different than if you lived in, say, New Jersey. Either way, you are still out of state. What a future landlord cares most about is that you earn 80 times the monthly rent and have good credit. But if your stepdaughter falls in love with an alcove studio in a building with a guarantor-averse landlord, you could offer to pay the entire year's rent upfront, which would certainly make her an attractive candidate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beaten Down by Broker Fees</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I moved to the New York City metropolitan area from Washington about a year ago. I cannot understand why broker fees are passed on to the renter, rather than paid by the landlord. In all other places I have lived, landlords either list the property themselves or pay a broker to list it for them. Passing the broker fee on to the renter makes it very difficult for a young professional like me not to just want to pack up and go back to where it is easier to find a place to live.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mount Sinai, New York</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You are not the only one who resents writing a check to someone who might have done little more than unlock the door for you. Brokers often charge renters a fee of 15 percent of the annual rent, which comes to $5,400 for a $3,000-a-month apartment -- a steep price for moving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why don't landlords pay the fee? Simply put, they don't have to. With vacancy rates under 3 percent in Manhattan, renters have no choice but to pay. In Suffolk County, your neck of the woods, the situation isn't much better. In fact, average rent was $2,525 a month in November, up almost 11 percent from a year ago, according to Zillow. Rising rents might help explain why the broker-fee tradition has spread to the suburbs, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's really detrimental to the wallet, especially for young professionals,'' said Stephanie Diamond, who created a no-fee listing service called the Listings Project when she tired of paying broker's fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are ways to avoid paying. New developments often waive the broker fee, but these apartments usually include a luxury price tag. If you are open to sharing an apartment, search roommate listings instead: An apartment that has already been rented to someone else will not have a fee. There are also several websites that list no-fee apartments. The pickings might be slim, but good finds do exist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You will not have access to every apartment,'' said Mark Sperry, the vice president of Urban Edge, a website that lists no-fee apartments in the New York area. ''But that doesn't mean that you won't be able to find an apartment in your price range.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1990, almost a million houses were built in the United States. One of them, at 12204 Backus Drive in Bowie, Md., was a four-bedroom colonial with a bay window. The average home price that year was $150,000; this house, in a desirable middle-class suburb of Washington, sold for $227,140.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like every house, it became a vessel for its inhabitants’ personalities and possessions — the vast record collection of the first owner, the wedding photos of the most recent ones. It also came to hold a promise of prosperity, as the boom encouraged Americans to think of houses as not just places to live, but as investments that, thanks to rising prices, could dispense huge cash returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The story of 12204 Backus Drive is in many ways the story of the American housing market: first anodyne, then ruinous, then resilient. It is peopled with losers and villains, lucky winners and a young couple hoping for, but not counting on, good fortune. This house’s value peaked at $540,000, plunged to $215,000, and rapidly convalesced until, last year, it sold for an amount that might be considered auspicious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Virtually all the economic turmoil of the last seven years started with the housing market, which powered the economy during the bubble and then nearly melted down, taking the financial system with it. Almost five million homes were lost in foreclosure[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/f/foreclosures/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] in the last five years, according to <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>, and houses in some cities lost two-thirds of their value before starting to recover a couple of years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now prices have bounced up 10 to 25 percent from their bottom, so quickly that a few economists have warned of a second bubble. As the rebound effect fades and interest rates continue to rise, that growth, already uneven, is expected to slow considerably. But experts say that if the job market keeps improving, the housing market will rise with it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The various owners of 12204 Backus Drive still see homeownership as a sound choice — even those who were badly pummeled by market forces. They are joined in that belief by a vast majority of Americans; lending for home purchases rose from a low of $404 billion in 2011 to an estimated $652 billion last year, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while Americans still want to own their homes, the scars of the financial debacle hold them back in other ways. Some large banks, unmotivated by low interest rates and afraid they will have to buy back any loans that go bad, have cut back on mortgage[http://topics.nytimes.com/your-money/loans/mortgages/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] lending. Tighter lending standards are shutting out close to 12.5 million consumers who would qualify in normal times, according to an analysis by Mark Zandi, chief economist for <span class="companylink">Moody’s</span> Analytics. But perhaps more significant, individual attitudes have changed. A house is a residence, sure. A better investment than renting, yes. But it is no longer an A.T.M., a source of ready cash for a better lifestyle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor will it lead to as much economic growth. Doug Duncan[http://www.fanniemae.com/portal/about-us/company-overview/leadership/duncan.html], chief economist at <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, the mortgage giant, says homeowners today are less likely to spend their equity on renovations, cars, clothes or college. Many people who refinanced when interest rates were in decline, he said, have opted to pay down principal faster instead of lowering their monthly payments. “People will be more conservative than they were in the past,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suburban Dreams, Found and Lost</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bowie, a bedroom community in Prince George’s County, a 30-minute drive from Washington, was built on the ideal of affordable suburban living. It was first developed in the 1960s by the company that created Levittown, N.Y. The 1980s saw the rise of a second wave of homebuilding, as more luxurious subdivisions with larger houses, swimming pools and tennis courts were carved out of forests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At that time, a house was a place to live, not a way to get rich. The first owner of 12204 Backus Drive, a teacher, actually took a small loss — about $10,000 — when he sold it after eight years and moved to another suburb of Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But by 2002, prices had been rising for roughly a decade — and Roberto Ramos and Chong Kim, owners of a seafood takeout counter, bought 12204 Backus Drive for $299,000. They put 10 percent down and took out a fixed-rate mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like so many houses at the time, this one quickly became a source of cash. Mr. Ramos and Ms. Kim refinanced twice, which allowed them to siphon out $175,000. In retrospect, such behavior may seem reckless; hundreds of thousands of people wouldn’t have lost their homes in the crash if they hadn’t depleted their equity during the boom. But for those with good timing, like Mr. Ramos and Ms. Kim, the system worked: In April 2006, they sold the house for $540,000, more than enough to pay off their loans. The value of 12204 Backus Drive had risen 80 percent in four years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even at that price tag, the house struck Leslie Johnson as a good deal. Rising prices had taken on an aura of inevitability, and the whole country seemed to believe that they would never fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Johnson, a billing specialist at a law firm, had a son who was living in a nursing home after being severely disabled in an accident. She already owned a house, but says her homeowner’s association was making it difficult for her to install a wheelchair ramp and to build an accessible bathroom so her son could live at home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $540,000 price of the Backus Drive house seemed beyond her reach. But after providing documentation of her income (which she declined to disclose publicly), she was told that she had been preapproved. “They told me to go ahead and buy and just refinance later on to a more manageable mortgage payment,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From that point on, some of the most unsavory aspects of the subprime lending industry came into play.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a credit score at the low end of average, Ms. Johnson got a loan with high interest but a low teaser rate for the first two years. In February 2006 — when prices in Prince George’s County were nearing their peak — she put 5 percent down, and got a piggyback loan to cover the rest of a 20 percent down payment. Even with the teaser rate, her monthly payment was $4,175 for both loans, more than she was taking home in her paycheck each month. (That figure is based on public records; Ms. Johnson recalls the payment being somewhat lower.) But she had some savings that would help her cover the payments, she said, until she could refinance, which the bank assured her she could do very soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Less than a year later, she did refinance, but into a mortgage with a higher interest rate. Public records show that she consolidated the two original loans and took out an extra $20,000 in cash, but Ms. Johnson said she never saw the $20,000. (“What typically happened was people who had any home equity were targeted by mortgage brokers to refinance or buy a new home,” says Ellen Schloemer, spokeswoman for the Center for Responsible Lending[http://www.responsiblelending.org/]. “The equity that they had would get lost in the fees and the charges that people ended up paying to get that new mortgage.”)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new loan, from New Century Mortgage, was interest-only at first, so Ms. Johnson’s monthly payment actually decreased a bit, to $4,000. But that did not make it affordable. By her fourth payment, she was falling behind, and after less than a year, she had stopped paying altogether. She spent months trying to persuade the bank to lower the payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January 2008, her loan servicer gave her a loan modification[http://topics.nytimes.com/your-money/loans/loan-modifications/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] that actually increased her payments to more than $4,500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wanting out, Ms. Johnson hired a man named Barry Edmonds to negotiate a short sale with her lender. She began making her mortgage payments to an account he controlled. After more than two years, in May 2010, he instructed her to move out temporarily so he could ready the house for sale, she said, and she left behind furniture, photo albums and a new Jenn-Air oven. When she returned a couple of months later to pick up some belongings, she saw notices that the house was being repossessed. The locks had been changed. Shortly after that, Mr. Edmonds, and some $100,000 of her money, disappeared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(Mr. Edmonds was fined in absentia by Maryland authorities for more than $100,000 in Ms. Johnson’s case, and did not respond to attempts to reach him by phone and email and on social media.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Johnson described Mr. Edmonds as the malefactor in her story, unaware that virtually every financial entity she dealt with ultimately faced investigations and lawsuits related to predatory lending, foreclosure robo-signing, misleading investors or other abuses. As early as 2007, for example, the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>ordered[http://www.fdic.gov/news/news/press/2007/pr07022.html] Ms. Johnson’s original lender, <span class="companylink">Fremont Investment and Loan</span>, to stop making loans that borrowers could not afford, saying that its lending practices “substantially increased the likelihood of borrower default.” One recent analysis[http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/01/09/wall-street-predicts-50-billion-bill-to-settle-u-s-mortgage-suits/?ref=bankofamericacorporation] suggests that Wall Street will eventually have to pay around $50 billion for the banks’ role in the mortgage crisis, with about $15 billion of that going to consumers in the form of debt relief and other aid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, Ms. Johnson said, she has received nothing except a wrecked credit record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hardwood Floors From the Ashes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For two years, 12204 Backus sat vacant, its lawn overgrown and the paint on its garage door peeling. The bank tried to sell it for $265,000, then for $250,000. At one point, Martha and Jonathan Kim, a young couple out house-hunting, peered through a window and saw a mess. “No way we’re buying this house,” Ms. Kim said to herself. “I don’t care how cheap it is.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But foreclosed homes like this one were attractive to investors with cash. Big fund managers like the <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group</span> and Colony Capital snapped up 100,000 homes nationwide, according to Green Street Advisors, a research firm. Investors helped prices recover faster, but regular buyers, particularly those with impaired credit, complained that they couldn’t compete.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“When home prices were really high, there was no lending regulation, so the middle class and even the working class were able to buy these homes at very high prices,” said Glenn Kelman, chief executive of Redfin, the online real estate platform that helped The New York Times trace the history of 12204 Backus Drive. “And then, when homes became extremely affordable, the horse was out of the barn and the doors were closed, and they couldn’t borrow.” As late as December, investors accounted for one in five purchases of existing homes, according to the National Association of Realtors[http://www.realtor.org/news-releases/2014/01/december-existing-home-sales-rise-2013-strongest-in-seven-years].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices in Prince George’s County never fell quite low enough to attract bulk buyers. That created an opportunity for smaller investors, like a construction company called Greenway Homes that moved from construction to flipping houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April 2012, an affiliate of Greenway bought 12204 Backus Drive for $215,000 cash. Two Dumpsters full of trash had to be tossed, and all appliances — except Ms. Johnson’s Jenn-Air oven — replaced, said Traci Barsy, who oversaw the renovation. The company usually makes a profit of 10 percent, said Kate Weaver, the vice president, but she estimated that the return was lower for this house because its size drove up the renovation cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house received a new roof, air-conditioner, hardwood floors, tile and carpeting, a wet bar in the basement and extras like custom cabinets, upgraded molding and brushed nickel fixtures. When the listing hit the Internet, priced at about $390,000, a friend sent the link to Ms. Johnson. Having sunk her retirement[http://topics.nytimes.com/your-money/retirement/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] savings into the house, Ms. Johnson was moving from rental to rental, unable to provide a suitable living space for her son. When she saw the photographs, she cried.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kims — he a 31-year-old auto parts manager, she a 28-year-old second-grade teacher — saw the listing, too. They had been searching for a house for two years and had tucked away more than $100,000 by living with Mr. Kim’s parents, said Ms. Kim, who calls herself a “hard-core saver.” “I think paying rent is the biggest waste of money,” Ms. Kim said, adding that the couple weren’t counting on increasing home values or even a stable economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We didn’t overextend ourselves like so many people did in the past,” she said. “We would still be able to afford the mortgage payment if one of us lost our jobs.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgages are roughly seven times harder to get than they were five years ago, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association’s credit availability index[http://www.mbaa.org/ResearchandForecasts/MCAI.htm], and they show few signs of getting easier. The average credit score of borrowers who receive loans guaranteed by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> has increased to about 760 from about 720 in 2000, according to Black Knight Financial Services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with their large down payment, the Kims are paying a higher interest rate, 3.9 percent, than if Mr. Kim had had a better credit score, they said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple bought the house in March 2013; the recorded sale price was $381,000. Ms. Kim was initially reluctant to pay so much for a house that had so recently been much cheaper — until she saw the renovation. “It was so beautiful,” she said. Of the investor, Mr. Kim said, “I’m sure they deserve what profit they made.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the aftermath of the crash, many have made the argument that public policy overly encourages homeownership. Robert J. Shiller, the Nobel-winning economist (and a contributor to Sunday Business), says that while owning a home may be worthwhile for many reasons, historically, most homeowners have reaped little financial return for their investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chris Mayer[http://www4.gsb.columbia.edu/cbs-directory/detail/494803/Christopher+Mayer], a real estate professor at Columbia Business School, argues that homeownership is its own kind of social safety net, whether or not it is profitable. Homeownership rates, he said, are higher in cities like Charlotte, N.C., where values are fairly stable, than in coastal areas where they consistently climb. “Just by living in your home, you’re saving for your retirement,” he said. “This is a place where I think most homeowners get it right, compared to economists.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for 12204 Backus Drive, Mr. Mayer pointed out that even its lowest price in the crash was about the same as its previous trough, when the first owner sold it, but that its peaks had been much higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite their travails, all the recent owners of the house aspire to homeownership. The big winners in the boom, Mr. Ramos and Ms. Kim, went on to get burned in the bust, buying a bigger, more expensive house and losing it in a short sale. They are saving to buy again, Mr. Ramos said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Johnson, who went into foreclosure, is less hopeful, but would like to own a home. “I do believe in having your own home,” she said. “If you’re paying rent, you’re just helping someone else pay off their mortgage.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Martha and Jonathan Kim agree, and right now their $1,800 monthly mortgage payment is cheaper than rent would be. But in the house on Backus, more than half the rooms are sparsely furnished and rarely used, and that makes Ms. Kim uneasy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seated at her kitchen table, she half-joked about taking in boarders. “Sometimes I feel like we’re wasting money,” she said. “We’re just kind of sitting on too much land.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The phrase ''white-glove Manhattan co-op'' has invariably conjured the image of a fortresslike residence whose precincts could be stormed only via a gantlet distinguished by mountains of paperwork and a daunting personal interview. The New York condominium, the relatively new kid on the block, has seemed the opposite: laissez-faire in everything, from rules governing pets and smoking to regulations determining who could rent an apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Co-ops and condominiums are still two different animals. But in subtle yet tangible ways, each is taking on characteristics of the other as they compete for well-heeled buyers in an ever-more-challenging residential marketplace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although no co-op will admit to lowered admission standards, board members and applicants report brisker responses to applications and more welcoming personal interviews, traditionally so formidable that they were recently satirized on ''Saturday Night Live.'' And concurrently, in a shift that began a few years ago and is becoming more marked, many condominiums are imposing heftier and more numerous fees, tightening house rules and discouraging the short-term rentals that can give a building the hectic ambience of a hotel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In both cases, financial considerations are the driving force.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The issue is value,'' said Eva Talel, a partner in <span class="companylink">Stroock &amp; Stroock &amp; Lavan</span>, a law firm that represents the boards of more than 200 co-ops and condominiums in Manhattan. ''The goal is to attract financially strong buyers, because everyone wants the best people. And because co-ops and condominiums compete in the same marketplace, what makes one more desirable has an impact on the other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Many of the high-end condominiums coming on the market, like 15 Central Park West, are socially desirable and can compete with any high-end co-op,'' Ms. Talel said. ''So to enhance value, co-ops want to make the admissions process more user-friendly, without sacrificing the building's financial and neighborliness requirements, because if a seller gets a good price for an apartment, that benefits the entire building.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''And at some condominiums,'' she added, ''lax rules have led to many residents' being unhappy with who their neighbors are. So these residents are pushing for more stringent admission criteria, especially when it comes to foreign buyers and increasingly to renters.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CO-OPS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Southgate, a co-op whose Deco-detailed buildings cluster in the far East 50s, the once-intimidating interview has experienced a makeover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We wanted to be more user-friendly,'' said Ellise Delphin Rose, a member of the board's admissions committee. ''An application requires an enormous amount of paperwork and invades most of a person's privacy. So we don't have to rehash everything at the interview. The main goal is to see if a person seems neighborly.'' She describes the interview as ''the emotional intelligence screening.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If a person has led a responsible life and has good letters of recommendation,'' Dr. Rose said, ''what's the point of torturing or interrogating them or making them feel as if you're doing them a huge favor by admitting them to your little club?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Southgate's final verdict also comes more promptly. In the past, there was no particular hurry getting back to applicants after the board interview. ''Now they generally learn the answer in one day,'' Dr. Rose said. ''And the answer is usually positive.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brooke Bratton, a lawyer who moved to a two-bedroom in Southgate in May with her husband, Paul, an executive director of JPMorgan, and their daughter, Sydney, 6, was a grateful beneficiary of the new policies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When it came to the board interview,'' Ms. Bratton said, ''I had no idea what to expect. Previously we'd purchased homes in Vermont and in Bronxville, and we just bought the property. It was as simple as that. But we were pleasantly surprised. The interview was very friendly, very conversational and relaxed. No one was shooting questions at us.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the icing on the cake? The next morning the couple received an email welcoming them to the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shifts have also taken place at River House, the storied co-op on East 52nd Street overlooking the East River.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our standards have not changed,'' said John Allison, the board president. ''Actually, they've gotten tighter in terms of examining people's financials and determining whether they'll be good neighbors. At the same time, the process has become easier than ever.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The time spent evaluating a person's application was longer than we'd wish, sometimes as much as three to six months,'' Mr. Allison added. ''But starting about a year ago, we began getting back to people in less than 30 days.'' Because of the more user-friendly and timely procedures, he said, brokers are now eager to refer clients to the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As at Southgate, the board interview has undergone a makeover. ''We want to make it very human, not a test,'' Mr. Allison said. ''It's more open-ended, more conversational.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or as Philip Bobbitt, a Columbia Law School professor who with his wife, Maya Ondalikoglu Bobbitt, bought a three-bedroom penthouse at River House a year ago, summed up the experience, ''It was a nice afternoon.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like many prospective co-op buyers, Ms. Bobbitt, a lawyer, had expected the worst when it came to the application process. ''Most of our friends live on the Upper East Side, and we'd heard the horror stories,'' she said. ''That wasn't our experience.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her husband agreed. ''Fairly or not,'' he said, ''there's a sense that co-ops can be a little capricious, a little arbitrary. But at River House, we didn't feel that the board was playing games.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still other changes have been put in place at River House. Brokers may now mention the building's name and address in listings and show images of apartments on the market -- all of which had been forbidden. The period during the summer in which residents may make alterations to their apartments has been extended past Labor Day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Allison said the shifts were not prompted by what was going on in the condominium market -- ''It never crossed our minds'' -- but described them as motivated by economic realities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're an iconic building with a rich cultural history,'' he said, ''but having a great history doesn't mean having a great future. The world is changing, and we need to change, too. The shifts in the condo market have just confirmed our view.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steven Sladkus, a partner at Wolf Haldenstein Adler Freeman &amp; Herz who represents co-op and condominium boards, has noticed other changes at co-ops. ''Co-ops want to seem less nose-in-the-air, and they don't want to make the buyer sweat so much,'' Mr. Sladkus said. When it comes to board interviews, for example, he has seen instances of prospective buyers' being offered drinks and snacks to warm up the proceedings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some people are also finding it less onerous to rent co-op apartments, as was the case for Emily Weinstein, 23, and her boyfriend, Russell Gilbert, 24. The pair, who moved from Atlanta last summer to take jobs at Big Four accounting firms, had their eye on a large one-bedroom in a Carnegie Hill co-op with a monthly rent in the mid-$2,000s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We had a strong financial statement, with savings and no liabilities,'' said Ms. Weinstein, who was delighted by how speedily the process moved forward. In April, while still in Atlanta, the couple checked out the space via Skype, then sent in the required documents by overnight mail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We found out that we had our board interview approximately one month later, and our interview took roughly 20 minutes,'' Ms. Weinstein said. The broker, Aash Jethra of Citi Habitats, got the good news a few days later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jethra, too, was impressed with the speed and ease of the process. ''This is a co-op with a typically stringent board, a triumphant lobby, a rooftop pool,'' he said. ''Boards in this sort of building are usually looking for couples who are older, married, more advanced in their careers. These were new grads in their early 20s.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CONDOMINIUMS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the city's growing number of condominiums, things are changing in a different way. House rules are tightening -- dogs are increasingly persona non grata -- and fees are climbing and multiplying. Short-term renters -- the airbnb crowd -- are being discouraged, and even longer-term renters are finding the path more arduous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, smoking was banned at One Grand Army Plaza in Brooklyn, Richard Meier's shimmering glass tower overlooking Prospect Park, at the urging of Dennis Sughrue, the president of the condominium board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Secondhand smoke, firsthand smoke -- it was really wrecking some people's lives,'' Mr. Sughrue said, ''especially because it's impossible to seal off individual units.'' As a result of the change, he said, many residents have stopped smoking indoors, ''in part because we will impose significant fines upon them if they do.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sughrue attributed the shift to a broader evolution at condominiums, which have already sharpened scrutiny of prospective buyers to make sure that they have enough money to foot the bills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People like the flexibility of condominiums,'' Mr. Sughrue said. ''But they expect the same quality of life and financial security as co-op owners. So we're likely to see the adoption of more co-op-like rules.'' His board, for example, has explored imposing new restrictions on residents who fall behind on their common-charge payments. ''We can't deny access to basic services,'' Mr. Sughrue said. ''But we can, and will, deny access to our fabulous roof deck.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sladkus, the lawyer who represents co-op and condominium boards, has noticed other tactics used to cope with tardy payers. ''For example,'' he said, ''the doorman won't accept UPS packages or let in the guy delivering the Chinese food.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Short-term rentals fueled by Internet listings are another hot-button issue. Many people who bought apartments for investment purposes seek to amortize that investment by playing host to a steady stream of renters. In response, buildings are cracking down, toughening the rules for owners and renters alike. Doormen are being asked to report visitors arriving with piles of luggage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even longer-term potential renters are finding an altered landscape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A.K. LaMonica, the owner of Lash Out, a boutique spa in Red Bank, N.J., and until recently the vice president of a children's wear company, was seeking to rent a $2,500-a-month studio in the Leonori, a condominium on East 63rd Street steps from Central Park. She loved the petite high-ceilinged space, but was dismayed by the $9,000 in required extra payments, a figure that included two months' rent, $1,000 to the condominium association and $500 to the management company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Unless you have a nice chunk of change put away, that's a lot of money,'' said Ms. LaMonica, a self-described ''Jersey girl'' who always dreamed of living in the city but never expected the process to be so stressful. Nor did she understand why she waited a month for the management company's approval, even though her checks were cashed within a week or two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''No one said anything, and there was no explanation for the delay,'' Ms. LaMonica said. ''I couldn't move forward. I couldn't buy a bed or even sheets. As the weeks passed, I became so anxious. You start to wonder, did I do something wrong?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lease was signed on May 14, but the official approval didn't arrive until June 11, and Ms. LaMonica did not move in until July 1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her broker, Loretta Bricchi Lee of Citi Habitats, was also mystified by the length of the process. ''Generally it takes one or two weeks for approval of a renter in a condominium, and I've seen it take two or three days,'' Ms. Lee said. ''The law allows four weeks, but they really pushed the envelope. Also, this was a very straightforward situation. The client was a professional with a good income, very good financials, a great credit check. There was nothing negative about her application.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steven Furman, the director of management for <span class="companylink">Rudd Realty Management Corporation</span> and the manager of the Leonori, did not dispute Ms. LaMonica's account. ''We process packages as expeditiously as possible,'' Mr. Furman said, ''typically with a two-week turnaround.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More and higher fees are becoming commonplace. At 552 West 43rd Street, a small condominium where James Gricar, the president of Halstead, is board president, application fees that used to run $250 have reached the $500-to-$700 range. ''You don't want to turn condominiums into co-ops,'' Mr. Gricar said. ''But the issue is, how do you accommodate the owner and capture fees? Most condominiums have less of a reserve than co-ops, and they have to tighten their belts.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dylan Pichulik, the chief executive of XL Real Property Management, was taken aback when the owner of a two-bedroom condominium was ordered to put down a $7,000 deposit to cover any damage to communal areas that might be inflicted by the tenant renting her $5,800-a-month apartment. ''That's a ridiculous amount,'' Mr. Pichulik said. ''And it certainly makes the environment less friendly for investors.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Judith Woodfin, a broker with <span class="companylink">Fox Residential Group</span>, has witnessed the imposition of many new rules affecting renters, among them: forbidding pets and smoking on the part of new renters; the doubling of move in/move out fees, to $1,000 from $500; and the charging of a monthly $100 amenities fee, payable upfront for the term of the lease. She is also aware of instances in which renters are charged a monthly fee to offset wear and tear on the amenities and the cost of increased security with the high renter turnover in a building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hall Willkie, the president of Brown Harris Stevens Residential Sales, attributes many of these changes simply to the nature of urban apartment life. ''With vertical living,'' he said, ''you're really sharing a space. It's not like a home in the country. People need to understand that they're part of a group.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Aaron Shmulewitz, a partner of Belkin Burden Wenig &amp; Goldman whose specialty is co-ops and condominiums, cites what he describes as a new breed of renter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These younger, aggressive 20-somethings in finance, the young attorneys who are mini-masters of the universe, they could care less about the condition of the hallways,'' Mr. Shmulewitz said. ''Their attitude is, 'No one tells me what to do in my castle, whether it's smoking or pot or parties or playing the guitar.' And once a tenant is in, it's very hard to get them out.''</p>
<p>Emily Weinstein, 23, and Russell Gilbert, 24, might have been frowned upon as too young in the past, but their application to rent a large one-bedroom in a Carnegie Hill co-op proceeded apace. Dennis Sughrue, the board president of One Grand Army Plaza, a condominium in Brooklyn, above, says it is likely to adopt more co-op-like rules. The building has already banned smoking.

</div><div>2589 words</div><div>23 January 2014</div><div>NYT Blogs</div><div>NYTB</div><div>English</div><div>© 2014 The New York Times Company. All rights reserved   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenovo announced on Thursday that it would acquire <span class="companylink">IBM</span>’s low-end server business for $2.3 billion, signaling the successful completion of a deal that fell through a year ago, Neil Gough and David Gelles write in DealBook.[http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/01/23/lenovo-buys-ibm-server-business-for-2-3-billion] The server unit, which includes <span class="companylink">IBM</span>’s x86 server business, brings in an estimated $5 billion in revenue a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenovo said it would settle the transaction with $2 billion in cash and the balance in its own Hong Kong-listed shares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, Lenovo, which is based in China, and <span class="companylink">IBM</span> were in talks about the server business, but the deal fell through when the two companies could not agree on a price. But Lenovo’s reticence seems to have paid off for the company. <span class="companylink">Dell</span> and Fujitsu had expressed interest in buying the unit earlier this week, but because Lenovo had spent time last year analyzing the business, it was able to make a quick offer that <span class="companylink">IBM</span> was happy with.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LOOPHOLE FOR FOREIGN BANKS MAY CLOSE &nbsp;|&nbsp; For three years, overseas banks like <span class="companylink">Barclays</span>, <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> and <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> have not had to comply with parts of the Dodd-Frank Act, which aims to limit banks’ potential losses on loans and trades, simply because they were foreign. But this loophole may soon close, Peter Eavis writes in DealBook.[http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/01/22/exporting-u-s-rules-for-foreign-banks]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dodd-Frank can cause trepidation among bank executives because the rule requires banks to maintain a level of capital that would cover losses, which can weaken the measures of profitability that Wall Street obsesses over. The closing of the loophole is rankling many European banks, which have never had to report their American capital positions before and thus have been exempt from maintaining the same level of financial buffer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Opponents of the plan argue that the rule is detrimental to European banks because they will have to infuse their American units with large amounts of capital rather than set aside capital for their firms as a whole. Still, supporters claim the new foreign bank rules will create a level playing field for American banks and their European counterparts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DOCTOR’S FAULTY MEMORY ON DISPLAY AT SAC TRIAL &nbsp;|&nbsp; Dr. Sidney Gilman, the government’s star witness in the insider trading trial against Mathew Martoma, a former portfolio manager at <span class="companylink">SAC Capital Advisors</span>, showed signs of his age on Wednesday, Matthew Goldstein and Alexandra Stevenson write in DealBook[http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/01/22/details-slip-by-insider-trials-main-witness]. “There still remain some holes in my memory,” said Dr. Gilman, who is 81.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the witness stand for the third day, Dr. Gilman told the jury that he recalled only two weeks ago the full details of Mr. Martoma’s visit to his office at the <span class="companylink">University of Michigan</span> in July 2008. The meeting, during which Dr. Gilman said he relayed confidential information to Mr. Martoma about the results of a drug trial that had not yet been released, is central to the government’s claim that Dr. Gilman helped Mr. Martoma devise the largest insider trading scheme in history. During his cross-examination, which will continue on Thursday, Dr. Gilman at times took long pauses before answering questions. At other points, he asked the defense lawyer to repeat the question.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Martoma’s lawyers sought to discredit Dr. Gilman during opening statements, when they accused the prosecution of building a case “riddled with inconsistencies.” One lawyer brought up the fact that Dr. Gilman had been taking a drug known to cause confusion as part of the cancer treatment he was undergoing in the years he and Mr. Martoma were communicating.</p>

The anonymous author of the account has signed a book deal with Touchstone, an imprint of Simon &amp; Schuster, which announced the deal on Wednesday, Julie Bosman reports in DealBook.[http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/01/22/a-tell-all-born-from-goldman-gossip] The book will be called “Straight to Hell: True Tales of Deviance and Excess in the World of Investment Banking.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ICAHN TAKES TO TWITTER &nbsp;|&nbsp; Carl C. Icahn sent out a series of <span class="companylink">Twitter</span> messages on Wednesday about his position in Apple, causing a familiar stir in the markets. “Having purchased $500 million more $AAPL shares in the last two weeks, our investment has crossed the $3 billion mark yesterday,” Mr. Icahn posted just after 10:30 a.m. About a minute later, he sent a post on his disappointment in Apple’s board for not increasing its share buyback program.</p>

</div><div class="author">By RONDA KAYSEN   </div><div>1244 words</div><div>22 January 2014</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A development in Princeton, N.J., was intended to entice wealthy buyers with the promise of luxury living in a vibrant downtown setting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet since 2012, only a handful of units have sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By most calculations, the 100-unit complex of rentals, condominiums and townhouses should be a model for new urban development. With units adjacent to Palmer Square, the elegant homes are a short walk from dozens of shops and restaurants and the vaunted gates of <span class="companylink">Princeton University</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But only seven of the 48 homes have sold, including a 3,200-square-foot townhouse that went for $1.855 million. The rentals leased quickly and several more will be released onto the market this month, including two duplexes listed for $8,600 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The development was intended to tap into a desire among some Americans to trade in the car-dependent suburbs for more accessible urban centers. In a recent study by the National Association of Realtors, more than half of respondents preferred a neighborhood with a mix of stores, other businesses and housing. About three-fourths said a neighborhood was more important than the size of a home. Generally, the lifestyle appeals to two distinct groups: young professionals without children and retiring baby boomers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People are buying more than just a house,'' said Christopher B. Leinberger, a professor and director of the Center for Real Estate and Urban Analysis at <span class="companylink">George Washington University</span>. ''They're buying a neighborhood.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans are willing to pay more to live within walking distance from town, according to research by Mr. Leinberger. But while living in downtown Princeton would give a buyer access to an excellent public school system and a pleasant neighborhood with wine and cheese shops, there is no direct train to New York City, a deterrent for commuters. Instead, riders must take a shuttle ride to the nearby Princeton Junction train station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes in the Princeton development, called the Residences at Palmer Square, are priced at a premium, with 4,130-square-foot, three-bedroom condos listed as high as $3.4 million. ''It's priced pretty high for Princeton,'' said Harveen Bhatla, co-founder of the Bhatla-Usab Real Estate Group at Keller Williams Princeton Realty. ''They were unfortunate in their timing; they were building high-end luxury homes when the market was going down.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last year, the Princeton housing market has begun to recover, with inventory tightening and prices rising. As of November 2013, the average selling price for a single-family home was $1.698 million and the average selling price for a condo was $743,500, according to data provided by Bhatla-Usab. Nearly all of the properties that sold for $1 million or more were large homes with four or more bedrooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the residential complex sits atop a parking garage. Internal plazas provide benches, landscaping and walkways open to the public. But rather than face the bustle of downtown, the condos face inward, looking onto a setting that seems more like a serene private community than a new addition to a central square.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is very, very dense and I don't think that it helps the town,'' said Allan W. Kehrt, an architect who conducted a feasibility study for the site several years ago. ''It is this huge, almost inaccessible community that was plopped down in the middle of Princeton.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The development has struggled with setbacks for decades. In 1989, a developer built several housing units and parking spaces, but the development stalled and remained a half-built eyesore for years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Palmer Square Management acquired the property in 1992, the company spent years negotiating an affordable-housing agreement with the town. The final agreement called for 10 affordable rental units. By the time construction on the new residences finally began in 2009, the housing market was in the grips of the worst downturn of a generation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We knew that sales were going to be a little bit lagging as the country recovered from the recession,'' said David Newton, vice president of Palmer Square Management, which also operates the retail and office space in Palmer Square.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the residential component struggles to draw buyers, the retail center is nearly 96 percent occupied with a mix of local shops and national chains including Kate Spade New York, Brooks Brothers and the Bent Spoon, an ice cream shop. At the center of the square sits the Nassau Inn, a landmark Princeton hotel. On a brisk winter morning, Palmer Square was bustling with shoppers and the hotel lobby was full of guests, many seated in red leather lounge chairs near a roaring fire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Palmer Square has long been a symbol of the potential -- and the problems -- of urban renewal. The zinc magnate Edgar Palmer began building the square during the Great Depression. Other sections were added over the years. To make way for his idyllic vision of a new downtown, he uprooted an African-American neighborhood. Later, in the 1950s, another African-American community was displaced to create a new street grid on the site that is now the Residences at Palmer Square.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is this enormous social justice wound and it's represented by that site,'' said Sheldon Sturges, a founder of Princeton Future, a community planning organization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Henry Pannell recalls growing up in a close-knit, working-class community on what is now the site of the residential development. When he was a teenager, his family moved from his childhood home when the street was razed and the area reconfigured. ''Everything looks out of character to me as far as my childhood and the memories that I have of that street,'' said Mr. Pannell, who is now 75 and lives nearby on Clay Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The architect Thomas Stapleton designed the original section of Palmer Square in a neocolonial style. The quaint center is a mix of brick, stone and wood shingle buildings with shop names etched in black. The Nassau Inn recently finished a $20 million renovation. Its ballroom, conference rooms, mechanical systems and guest rooms were all renovated. Small, outdated guest rooms were enlarged and updated, reducing the total number of rooms to 188. The ballroom was updated with new finishes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new condos and townhouses share the colonial style of Palmer Square, with wrought-iron banisters, 10-foot-high ceilings, crown molding and gas fireplaces. Kitchens have traditional finishes with maple cabinets and granite countertops. The townhouses are equipped with private elevators. Condos start at $1.245 million for a two-bedroom and townhouses range from $1.775 million for a two-bedroom to $2.195 million for a three-bedroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last spring, Palmer Square Management revamped its marketing strategy to lure buyers. The complex is now advertised on Google China and the brochure has been translated into Mandarin in the hopes of luring international buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We know it's not for everyone,'' said Adrienne Albert, chief executive of the Marketing Directors, the real estate firm that is marketing the development. ''It's a very special lifestyle; it's a very special product.''</p>

</div><div class="author">By CARL RICHARDS   </div><div>771 words</div><div>6 January 2014</div><div>NYTimes.com Feed</div><div>NYTFEED</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014. The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I’m not big on market predictions. In fact, if anyone asks, I’m pretty quick to say that I don’t know what the markets will do in 2014. If you absolutely must have predictions for the next year, then I recommend you check out Barry Ritholtz’s annual list[http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2013/12/my-annual-predictions-for-the-coming-year-2014-edition/]. But if you are interested in something more useful than predictions, I suggest taking a look at what we learned (or had confirmed — again) in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. What goes up, will go down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After going up for 12 years, gold gave us one more example that just about the time your neighbor starts yelling about how it is the only safe place to put your money, things change. In 2013, gold prices declined 28 percent[http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304591604579292321014055380].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2. What goes down, will go up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As I discussed last week[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/30/your-money/reading-between-the-lines-of-2013s-big-stories.html], home prices have headed steadily upward since 2012. In fact, according to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller home price indexes, prices rose 13.6 percent[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/home-prices-stage-advance-according-to-the-spcase-shiller-home-price-indices-238236321.html] over the 12 months that ended in October, the fastest increase since February 2006. But remember how we felt about housing prices in 2008-9[http://money.cnn.com/2009/02/12/real_estate/Latest_median_prices/]?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In February 2009, CNNMoney.com reported: “Home prices fell 12.4 percent during the fourth quarter of 2008, the largest year-over-year decline since the National Association of Realtors began keeping comprehensive records in 1979.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No matter how bad we felt about home values, markets do turn around. Of course, the improvement in the housing market has led to the next phase: bubble spotting[http://www.cnbc.com/id/101303104].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3. Looking for bubbles isn’t an investment strategy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based on what we have experienced in the last 10 years, I understand why we obsess over trying to identify the next bubble. Of course, it would be awesome if we could have predicted when the bubble was going to burst on tech stocks in ’99 or on home prices in ’07. The reality is that trying to spot bubbles to guide our investing decisions doesn’t work. Case in point: the less-than-accurate predictions[http://www.cnbc.com/id/100552025] that the stock market was just a pinprick away from popping in 2013. Turns out 2013 was a good year for stocks, but of course that does not mean 2014 will be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4. Past performance doesn’t predict future results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">United States stocks did incredibly well in 2013. When you include dividends, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 rose 31.9 percent. That’s the best year since 1997[http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/markets/2013/12/31/market-year-end-high/4263237/]. With the Dow up 26.5 percent and the Nasdaq up 38.3 percent, it’s tempting to get excited about 2014. But what happened in 2013 gives us no real indication of what is in store for 2014. The only thing we know now is that the markets had a great year — that’s it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">5. Buying high and selling low still doesn’t make sense.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the huge year the stock market had, there is a temptation to think that now is the time to shift more of our portfolios into stocks. It’s easy to understand why we feel this way. After all, the stock market is doing well, we are hearing about it in the news, and we don’t want to miss out. But remember, since it is now January 2014 you have already missed the opportunity to buy in January 2013. Now the market is higher, and we have already established that we do not know what the market is going to do next. We only know what it has already done. Resist the temptation to buy high, and instead focus on maintaining a well-designed portfolio that reflects the risk needed to meet your goals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">6. Crises come and go.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe I missed it, but did the world come to an end on Oct. 1? After all, the United States government closed up shop for 17 days. While it was not pleasant for furloughed federal workers and tourists wanting to visit national parks, it is hard to see why this most recent crisis du jour was worth all the news coverage (almost 500 million <span class="companylink">Google</span> hits). In 2013 we were reminded yet again that whatever “this” is, it too shall pass, and accommodating the latest crisis is not an excuse to upend an investing strategy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These are just a few of the lessons I spotted in 2013. I have no doubt that in 2014 many of these lessons and probably several others will be reinforced. The only question is whether we have already learned the lessons or we will keep repeating our mistakes.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Shoring Up Hamptons Beaches, and Prices, Too</span>
</div><div class="author">By MARCELLE SUSSMAN FISCHLER   </div><div>575 words</div><div>5 January 2014</div><div>NYTimes.com Feed</div><div>NYTFEED</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2014. The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though waterfront usually sells at a premium, sometimes real estate prices in the Hamptons[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/classifieds/realestate/locations/newyork/longisland/hamptons/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] ebb and flow with the shifting sands. In Sagaponack, for instance, the price on Billy Joel’s four-bedroom six-bath shingle-style home with 145 feet of sandy beach was raised to $23.5 million recently, from $16.75 million in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With new dune shrubbery, a swimming pool in the works, air-conditioning being installed on the second level and parts of the 5,500-square-foot living space getting a redo, the house is on the market [http://www.corcoran.com/hamptons/Listings/Display/2972872#WebID=25117]for more than the $22.5 million Mr. Joel sought in 2009 after his split from his wife, the cookbook author Katie Lee, said Biana Stepanian, the listing agent and an associate broker with <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also factoring into the higher price is a $26 million beach-nourishment project underway in Sagaponack, Water Mill and the Town of Southampton to help buffer homes from future storms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s not just one mitigating factor when you put a price together,” Ms. Stepanian said. “It’s everything involved.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Martin Shea, the chief environmental analyst for Southampton, said that nearly 2.9 million cubic yards of sand from a deep-water area one mile offshore were being used to extend the beachfront “significantly further seaward,” at an average of 75 to 100 feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The excess sand helps naturally rebuild dunes and allows vegetation to propagate. Using state-owned bottomlands — not the oceanfront properties themselves — the project is being paid for over a 10-year period by homeowners in a special beach erosion control taxation district[http://www.southamptontownny.gov/filestorage/72/837/1839/6691/Q%26A_8.10.12_Info_Session.pdf].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The effort “boosts people’s confidence,” said Gary DePersia, an associate broker with <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August, with the renourishment project on the horizon, Mr. DePersia raised the listing price on a renovated three-bedroom cottage on an oceanfront acre in Water Mill to almost $9 million from $8.5 million. He received “multiple offers right away.” The house went into contract within four months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2012, in the wake of Hurricane Sandy[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/h/hurricanes_and_tropical_storms/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], oceanfront buyers held back, concerned about how the coastline would be protected and how much insurance premiums would rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The beach renourishment “will stabilize the beach, enhance the aesthetics and add value to every house that is on the ocean,” Mr. DePersia said. There are 10 oceanfront listings in the area, ranging from a $29 million property in Bridgehampton to a $9 million cottage in Watermill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Judi A. Desiderio, the chief executive of Town and Country Real Estate in East Hampton, says that whenever there’s a hurricane, or even “a tsunami in another country,” waterfront buyers “do shy away, but then people come back,” perennially lured by the relaxing prospect of sitting and watching the water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Acknowledging that oceanfront houses “feel strengthened by the reinforcement,” and that the project “helps values,” Ms. Desiderio says prices are likely to soar regardless. She attributed much of the increase to a strong market, especially at the high end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate in the Hamptons gets “exponentially more expensive” as you move toward a body of water, she pointed out. “The larger the body of water, the higher the price tag.”</p>
<p>The asking price of Billy Joel’s four-bedroom waterfront home in Sagaponack was recently raised, thanks to renovations and a beach- erosion project underway in the area. | Corcoran | Mr. Joel’s home | Corcoran   </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a great year for the stock market. And it was also a pretty good year for many Americans’ biggest investment: their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last glimpse in 2013 at the American housing market, figures released Tuesday showed that home prices in major metro areas had kept rising in October. Year-over-year, prices were up 13.6 percent, the biggest gain in more than seven years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After plummeting during the housing bust, prices have increased steadily since the spring of 2012. Prices in 20 major American metro areas increased a modest two-tenths of a percent from September to October, without seasonal adjustment, evidence that the quick rebound in prices is slowing, according to the closely watched <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor’s</span>/Case-Shiller data. Higher mortgage rates might continue to slow the pace of improvement, analysts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, the increase in home prices is moderating, the S.&amp;P./Case-Shiller analysis said. Prices decreased in nine metro areas from September to October, including Denver, Chicago and Washington, whereas just one showed a price decrease from August to September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘Monthly numbers show we are living on borrowed time and the boom is fading,’’ David M. Blitzer of S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices said in an analysis of the new data. A big question, he said, was how quickly the Federal Reserve pulls back from its efforts to keep interest rates low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘The key economic question facing housing is the Fed’s future course to scale back quantitative easing and how this will affect mortgage rates,’’ Mr. Blitzer said. ‘‘Other housing data paint a mixed picture suggesting that we may be close to the peak gains in prices.’’ He added: ‘‘Most forecasts for home prices point to single-digit growth in 2014.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many metro areas where prices declined sharply — particularly those encompassing Sun Belt and Rust Belt cities like Phoenix, Las Vegas and Detroit — similarly sharp rebounds followed. But generally, prices have not touched their pre-bust heights, with prices around the country remaining about 20 percent lower, the S.&amp;P./Case-Shiller data show. In Dallas and Denver, however, prices have hit new peaks, the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists expect price increases to moderate in the coming year, with higher prices and higher mortgage costs making homes less affordable, even though the labor market recovery might pick up some steam and inventory might increase in some areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, the Fed said that improving economic conditions warranted the central bank starting to ease up on its stimulus efforts. The Fed said it would cut its monthly purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities to $75 billion a month from $85 billion a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘Even after this reduction, we will be still expanding our holdings of longer-term securities at a rapid pace,’’ Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, said in December at a news conference, his last before Janet L. Yellen takes over, pending Senate confirmation. ‘‘Our sizable and still-increasing holdings will continue to put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and make financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote further progress in the labor market.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But mortgage rates have risen, and the pace of sales has slowed in many metro areas. According to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>, an industry group, existing-home sales dropped 4.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.9 million in November. New-home sales dropped 2.1 percent, the Census Bureau said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘Rising house prices over the past six months are making it more challenging for the typical family to purchase a home without stretching beyond their means,’’ Frank Nothaft, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, the government-backed mortgage finance company, said in an analysis. ‘‘We expect mortgage rates to rise over the coming year, so it’s critical we start to see more job gains and income growth in the coming year.’’</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON — The number of Americans who signed contracts to buy existing homes in November was nearly unchanged from October, suggesting sales are stabilizing after several months of declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said on Monday that its seasonally adjusted index for pending home sales ticked up to 101.7 from 101.5 in October. The October figure was revised lower from an initial reading of 102.1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher mortgage rates and strong price gains over the last two years have slowed sales. The pending home sales index had fallen for five straight months before November. Completed sales of existing homes fell for three straight months, the association said earlier this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is generally a one- to two-month lag from a signed contract to a completed sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average interest rate on a 30-year mortgage edged higher to 4.48 percent last week, from 4.47 percent the previous week. Mortgage rates jumped about 1.25 percentage points from May through September, peaking at 4.6 percent, after the Federal Reserve’s chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, indicated in the spring that the Fed would start to scale back its economic stimulus program before the end of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this month, the Fed announced it would reduce its $85 billion in monthly purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities by $10 billion a month starting in January. The bond purchases are intended to hold down longer-term interest rates and encourage more borrowing and spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Kavcic, an economist at BMO Capital Markets, said that recent housing market indicators had been mixed. Applications for mortgages to purchase homes fell to a nearly two-year low last week, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Kavcic said, “We continue to believe that the U.S. housing market will absorb the upward move in mortgage rates and push higher in 2014, helped by still-attractive affordability, better job growth and improved confidence in the recovery.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the recent declines, sales of existing homes should reach 5.1 million in 2013, the highest total in seven years, the association forecast. That is 10 percent higher than 2012’s total of almost 4.7 million. But it is still below the 5.5 million that is consistent with a healthy housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The association forecast that sales would remain largely flat in 2014 and then rise to 5.3 million in 2015. Steady job gains should make it easier for more people to buy homes. And mortgage rates remain low by historical standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signed contracts for existing homes rose in the South and West last month, while falling in the Northeast and Midwest.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders for long-lasting manufactured goods surged in November and a gauge of planned business spending on capital goods recorded its largest increase in nearly a year, pointing to sustained strength in the American economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While another report on Tuesday showed new-home sales slipped in November, sales in October were revised to show the highest pace in more than five years. In addition, house prices rebounded, underscoring the economy’s improving fundamentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We are coming out of the shadows of the Great Recession in many ways,” said Robert A. Dye, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Comerica</span> in Dallas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said durable goods orders jumped 3.5 percent last month as demand increased for a range of goods, including aircraft, machinery, and computers and electronic products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase, which outpaced economists’ expectations for a 2 percent rise, more than reversed a drop in October. Excluding transportation, orders recorded their largest gain in six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonmilitary capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, surged 4.5 percent. The increase snapped two straight months of declines and was the largest advance since January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increases in these so-called core capital goods orders and in durable goods orders over all suggested strength in manufacturing and were further evidence of a firming economic growth outlook. They narrow the gap with sentiment surveys that have offered a more upbeat view of manufacturing than government data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Sentiments were showing things were good but not the hard numbers. Things seemed to have turned now,” said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo Securities</span> in Charlotte, N.C. “Businesses going into 2014 are more confident in their outlook.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From consumer spending to employment and trade, the foundations appear to be in place for sustained and strong economic growth in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a second report, the Commerce Department said new-home sales fell 2.1 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 464,000 units. October’s sales, however, were revised to a 474,000-unit pace, the highest level since July 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the fall, home sales retained the bulk of the previous month’s 17.6 percent increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The durable goods report showed that shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate equipment spending in the government’s measure of gross domestic product, increased 2.8 percent last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was the largest rise since March 2012, prompting economists at <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> to raise their fourth-quarter G.D.P. estimate by a tenth of a percentage point to a 2.4 percent annual rate. Shipments had dropped in September and October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturing is being bolstered by the housing market recovery, through demand for building materials and household appliances. Home resales momentum has, however, slowed somewhat since the summer because of higher mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales are expected to accelerate next year, driven in part by employment gains.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks scored modest gains on Tuesday as investors exercised restraint from making big bets in a short session before the Christmas holiday, with the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor’s</span> 500-stock index and the Dow once again ending on highs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Markets closed early on Tuesday and will remain shut until Thursday. Trading was extremely light during the day’s abbreviated session, which ended at 1 p.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Volume is expected to remain muted throughout the week, and the light trading could allow for greater volatility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both the S.&amp;P. 500 index and the Dow continued to ascend to nominal highs; the S.&amp;P. 500 hit a record for a third day in a row and the Dow reached a record for the fifth consecutive session. Further upside may be limited at these levels, especially in the absence of major trading catalysts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What we are seeing is the market heading into the Christmas holiday extended on a near-term basis, but we are not seeing any interest in profit-taking,” said Fred Dickson, chief market strategist at <span class="companylink">D.A.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the latest positive sign for the American economy, data showed orders for long-lasting manufactured goods rose 3.5 percent in November and a gauge of planned business spending on capital goods had its largest increase in nearly a year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S.&amp;P. 500 reached a record intraday high of 1,833.32, and Dow also hit an intraday high of 16,360.60</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S.&amp;P. 500 has soared 28.5 percent this year, largely because of stimulus measures from the Federal Reserve. The index is on track for its best year since 1997. The Dow is up 24.8 percent in 2013 while the Nasdaq has jumped 37.6 percent for the year.</p>

</div><div class="author">By DANIEL INDIVIGLIO   </div><div>422 words</div><div>24 December 2013</div><div>NYT Blogs</div><div>NYTB</div><div>English</div><div>© 2013 The New York Times Company. All rights reserved   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing recovery in the United States could run out of steam in 2014. Banks are likely to tighten lending standards once new rules come into place. Rising interest rates may drive down home loan volume, too. Cash purchases by investors could set a floor for house prices, but they may not be enough to prevent a major slowdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of late, the market has been on a tear. American home prices in the third quarter of 2013 rose 11 percent compared with the same period a year earlier, the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller index shows. That’s the strongest jump since the bubble popped six years ago. Foreclosure activity, meanwhile, has fallen to 2005 levels, according to the online marketplace RealtyTrac. And existing home sales have been the best since 2007, with over 5 million on an annualized basis since May, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> reports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Washington appears poised to throw cold water on the fiery recovery. In January, the so-called Qualified Mortgage rule goes live. It sets strict new standards on lenders who want to avoid borrower lawsuits. That could shrink home loan credit from the current level, which is already lower than before the boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congress may even make some reforms to mortgage finance next year, possibly laying out the funeral plan for <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. Both lawmaking chambers are pondering bills, and the outgoing Senate Banking Committee chairman, Tim Johnson, needs some legacy legislation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, demand for mortgages is likely to shrink, too. That’s because long-term interest rates are on the verge of rising after years of the Federal Reserve holding them artificially low. Not only will that lead to a slump in borrowers refinancing their existing home loans — a business that already dropped in 2013 — it will also dissuade some from buying a new home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s not looking totally bleak. Since mid-2010 all-cash purchases, mostly by investors like Blackstone, have made up 30 percent of all existing home sales, according to the Realtors’ association. That’s more than three times its historical norm. That may prevent house prices from plummeting, but it’s of little comfort to the average buyer.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON — Sales of existing homes fell in November and new filings for unemployment benefits rose unexpectedly last week, putting a wrinkle in an otherwise brightening economic picture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reports on Thursday came a day after the Federal Reserve gave the economy a vote of confidence by announcing that it would reduce its monthly $85 billion bond buying program by $10 billion starting in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Things have not changed. It’s still a marginally rosier outlook in the short-term,” said Jacob Oubina, senior United States economist at <span class="companylink">RBC Capital Markets</span> in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/national_association_of_realtors/index.html?inline=nyt-org] said sales of previously owned homes fell 4.3 percent last month to an annual rate of 4.9 million units. That was the lowest since December 2012 and the third straight monthly drop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A rise in interest rates since the spring and fast-rising home prices have shut some potential buyers out of the market, dampening home sales in recent months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists polled by Reuters had expected home resales to fall only to a 5.03 million-unit pace in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median home prices increased 9.4 percent from a year ago and the share of distressed properties — foreclosed and short sales — declined over the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory of previously owned homes on the market slipped 0.9 percent to 2.09 million units, representing a 5.1 months’ supply at November’s sales pace. That compared to 4.9 months’ worth in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A supply of six months is normally considered healthy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 10,000 last week to 379,000, the highest level since March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But other labor market indicators have pointed to a strengthening in job growth, and economists discounted the data, which covered the period for the government’s December nonfarm payrolls survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The rise was likely due to year-end holiday seasonal layoffs, which the government struggles to adjust properly at this time of year,” said Mei Li, an economist at FTN Financial in New York. “Nevertheless, claims will have to be watched closely in coming weeks. If the rise does not quickly reverse it will be a sign there is more going on.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A third report showing that factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region picked up last month offered an upbeat signal on labor market conditions. The rise in the <span class="companylink">Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank</span>’s business activity index was driven by gains in employment measures and new orders.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON — Builders began construction on the highest number of new homes in nearly six years in November, a sign of strength in the economy that underscores the Federal Reserve’s decision to start tapering off its economic stimulus campaign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that housing starts jumped[http://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/pdf/newresconst.pdf] 22.7 percent last month from October, the biggest increase since January 1990, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.09 million units. That was the highest level since February 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In contrast, housing starts increased just 1.8 percent in October, to an annual pace of 889,000 units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The last piece of the economic puzzle is falling into place and the expansion is assured,” said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at <span class="companylink">Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi</span> UFJ.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed announced on Wednesday that it would reduce its monthly $85 billion in bond purchases by $10 billion starting in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strong increase in housing starts provided the latest indication the economy was strengthening, with employment rising solidly in October and November, and retail sales and industrial production exceeding expectations last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists, who had expected housing starts to come in at a rate of 950,000 units in November, raised their fourth-quarter gross domestic product estimates by as much as two-tenths of a percentage point on Wednesday to as high as a 2.3 percent annual rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A run-up in mortgage rates in the spring, in anticipation that the Fed would taper off its monthly bond purchases, took some edge off the housing sector’s recovery earlier in the year, but a steady increase in household formation from multi-decade lows continued to prop up demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, groundbreaking for single-family homes, the largest segment of the market, climbed 20.8 percent to a pace of 727,000 units annually, the highest level since March 2008. Starts for multifamily homes jumped 26.8 percent to a rate of 364,000 units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Multifamily starts have risen strongly through the course of the housing recovery, buoyed by demand for rental apartments as relatively high unemployment and stringent lending practices by banks priced some potential homeowners out of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While new permits to build homes fell 3.1 percent in November to a rate of 1.01 million units annually, they were above economists’ expectations for a 990,000-unit pace. Building permits usually lead housing starts by at least a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The housing pickup is sustainable into the first half of 2014,” said Jay Morelock, an economist at FTN Financial. “Builders are optimistic about consumer demand, even in the face of rising rates and stronger prices.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The subprime mortgage crisis gave rise to a raft of regulations intended to guard against another disastrous market bubble. But beyond that, some financial-services companies are betting that lingering fears among buyers will generate demand for products that would shield them from losses if home values took another dive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">AmTrust Financial Services</span> is marketing an insurance program called Underwater Mortgage Protection, which promises to cover any gap should borrowers have to sell at a time when their houses are worth less than their mortgage amounts. EquityLock Solutions in Denver is offering Home Price Protection contracts, promising to replace equity lost between purchase and resale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both products are available in a limited number of states. EquityLock’s business is mainly in the Midwest and on the West Coast, while AmTrust began its underwater-insurance program this month in North Carolina[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/great-homes-and-destinations/destinations/the-carolinas/index.html?inline=nyt-geo], Oklahoma, Georgia, Arizona[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/great-homes-and-destinations/destinations/southwest/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] and Alabama. The program’s co-founder, Matthew Kayton, says he hopes to be licensed in all 50 states within the next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither product will help the multitude of borrowers now underwater. Although their numbers have declined[http://www.zillow.com/blog/2013-11-20/negative-equity-rate-falls-at-fastest-pace-ever-in-q3/] since the housing market crash, nearly 11 million homeowners remain in a negative equity position, according to Zillow, a real estate website.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These protections are aimed at borrowers who are in a healthy equity position and might be persuaded to pay a little more to keep it that way. “Real estate markets are always cycling,” Mr. Kayton said. “The consumer doesn’t want to get caught in that down cycle.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Underwater Mortgage Protection costs, on average, $30 to $40 a month, depending on a home’s value and a borrower’s loan-to-value ratio. Homeowners must have at least 10 percent equity to qualify, and the home must be their primary residence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners may file a claim if they need to sell when their home values fall below their mortgage balance. Underwater Mortgage will help sell the home and pay off the lender. “We pay the gap to the lender so the lender is made whole,” Mr. Kayton said. “Then we pay all seller-side closing costs, including Realtor commissions. The goal is that the seller will not have to write a check when they go to closing.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EquityLock works differently: It pays out a benefit to the contract holder based solely on a local house price index computed by the Federal Housing Finance Agency[http://www.fhfa.gov/]. If, say, at the time you were selling, the index was 8 percent lower than when you took out the contract, EquityLock would cover that loss of equity. “Independent of what you sell the house for,” said Ted Rusinoff, the company president, “we’re going to pay you for any decline in the index.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The EquityLock product costs $295 for $100,000 of home value protection for five years. The homeowner has to hold the contract for at least two years before making a claim. More extensive coverage over a 15-year term is available at an average cost of 2 percent of the home’s value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EquityLock is marketing its product mainly through mortgage firms, some of which, like 1st Advantage Mortgage in Chicago, offer it free to customers. “It’s a hit or miss with customers who get it or don’t get it,” said Paul Lueken, the president of 1st Advantage. “Some think the market has already bottomed and they’re not interested, and some see the value.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When considering these products, consumers ought to “thoroughly review all the fine print and terms rather than give a monthly fee for an imaginary comfort,” cautioned Lawrence Yun, the chief economist at the National Association of Realtors. They may be better off putting the money toward paying down their principal for a faster increase in equity, he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The wealth of Americans reached a nominal record high during the summer, buoyed by surging stock prices and a healthy recovery in home values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve said on Monday that household net worth in the United States rose 2.6 percent, to $77.3 trillion, from July through September. Net worth reflects the value of homes, stocks, bank accounts and other assets minus mortgages, credit cards and other debts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising stock prices increased the overall net worth of Americans by $917 billion. Higher home values added $428 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase in net worth is an encouraging sign for the economy. As Americans gain wealth, they typically spend more, and that drives faster growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report also showed that Americans were willing to borrow more in the third quarter. That suggests many are growing more confident in their jobs and the broader economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adjusted for inflation, though, net worth is still about 1 percent below its prerecession peak. But both the stock market and home prices have continued to increase in the fourth quarter. That is likely to push inflation-adjusted household wealth to a record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the gains have not been equally distributed. The wealthiest 10 percent of households own about 80 percent of the stocks. And homeownership has declined since the recession, particularly among lower-income Americans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total mortgage debt rose 0.9 percent from the previous quarter. That is the first increase since early 2009. The rise reflects growing home sales and fewer mortgage defaults.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans are also holding more consumer debt besides mortgages, in the form of student loans, auto loans and credit cards. Consumer debt rose 6 percent from the previous quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with the job market showing some signs of improvement and wages rising gradually, Americans appear able to handle the additional borrowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total after-tax income is rising faster than borrowing. That has pushed debts, as a percentage of income, to 99 percent. Before the recession, that ratio had peaked at about 125 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Edelstein, an economist at IHS Global Insight, said that improving household finances could make Americans more willing to spend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But much of that spending could hinge on consumers' willingness to continue borrowing. If Americans become hesitant to take on more debt, it could mean that the improvement in their finances will not necessarily lead to further sizable gains in spending.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A vintage TriBeCa loft building designed as a department store in 1862, reinvented as a warehouse for a children's shoe company and then, in 2001, gut-renovated and transformed into boutique apartments, has sold for $43 million. It was the most expensive sale of the week, and garnered one of the highest prices for a downtown residence, according to city records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crowned by a triplex penthouse, the building was first on the market for $45 million in 2011, and last year the asking price escalated to $49.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A six-story building with an elaborately carved limestone exterior and an elegant street-level storefront whose sole tenant is the German perfume maker Drom, 144 Duane Street was transformed by Studio Rivelli Architects in 2001 for the present seller, a private investor. The renovation created an 11,000-square-foot triplex on the fourth, fifth and sixth floors and two full-floor lofts on the second and third floors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daniel Romualdez Architects was retained to reimagine the interiors, which in contrast to the historic exterior are starkly modern and include multiple skylights and a floating staircase with blue glass steps, though ample exposed brick and cast-iron columns give a nod to the past. The building has eight bedrooms, 10 bathrooms, a rustic wood-burning fireplace girded in brick, and a combined 23,100 square feet of residential space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is, of course, an elevator among the refurbished mechanicals, and the penthouse also has 2,775 square feet of outdoor space divided between a roof deck and a terrace. The ceiling heights vary from 12 to 17 feet, the windows are oversized, and the 41-by-91-foot basement now contains a private gym and a half-court basketball court. The third-floor loft is a 4,000-square-foot floor-through, and the second floor is currently split into two units. The owner's triplex had previously been on the rental and sales markets as a separate entity. The asking price was $30 million; the monthly rental fee was $100,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leonard Steinberg, Yoko Sanada and Hervé Senequier of <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman Real Estate</span> handled the transaction on behalf of the seller, who used a limited-liability company, 144 Duane Street Corporation. The similarly anonymous buyer, identified in city records as Duane Street, was represented by a business manager/lawyer and did not use a broker. The commercial space, with a dedicated entrance, will remain on the ground floor, but the buyer requested that the residential portion of the building be delivered vacant, suggesting that it might be recombined as a single-family dwelling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The week's second-priciest sale, at the River House at 435 East 52nd Street, the 1931 Art-Deco co-op renowned for its panoramic East River views and emphatically selective co-op board, was also a property that had been on the market for several years and traded for less than the asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 13-room residence, No. 6A, sold for $10 million; it entered the market in 2010 with a list price of $18.89 million, and after several changes in price and listing brokerages, the most recent asking price had been $10.3 million. The elegantly proportioned co-op, with monthly maintenance fees of $10,446, has four bedrooms, four and a half baths, two fireplaces, three maids' rooms and, in the dining room and library, romantic bay windows that overlook the river. The 26-story River House, with a pair of 15-story wings and a quaint cobblestone driveway, was designed by Bottomley, Wagner, &amp; White.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sellers, the romance novelist Barbara Taylor Bradford and her husband, Robert, were represented by Serena Boardman and Eva J. Mohr of <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>; the buyer was the actress Uma Thurman, who somehow clicked with the stuffy co-op board, which in previous years had discouraged show-business personalities from buying there, a slight to which the actress Diane Keaton, among other rejected applicants, can attest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After an in-house dispute over the fate of the River House's private club, the River Club, the board has put the 62,000-square-foot club on the market to be recreated as a private mansion for a qualified owner with deep pockets and patience. John Burger and Kyle Blackmon of Brown Harris Stevens are the listing brokers, and the price is $130 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big Ticket includes closed sales from the previous week, ending Wednesday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Disparaged by some as the bogeymen of the housing crash, mortgage brokers have taken a beating over the last few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With many having been dropped by the big banks in favor of in-house sales channels, and with their industry much more tightly regulated, brokers have seen their ranks so drastically thinned that, instead of controlling the origination market as they did a decade ago, they account for a slim 9.7 percent, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, an industry publication.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet mortgage brokers are still a worthwhile option for borrowers, who now have some protection from the shady practices of the past. New federal regulations forbid brokers to pocket premiums from lenders in return for steering customers into higher-priced, high-risk loans. And under the SAFE Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008, brokers have to pass state licensing exams in order to prove they know the rules of the financing game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The nice thing that the SAFE act has done is we've weeded out a lot of those bad people that everyone likes to talk about,'' said Donald Frommeyer, the senior vice president of Amtrust Mortgage Funding in Carmel, Ind., and the president of the National Association of Mortgage Brokers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why a Broker?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A mortgage broker is basically a middleman. Brokers work with a variety of lenders to find loans for clients, but do not lend out money directly. That's the role of a mortgage lender, the entity that supplies the funds going to the closing table. The lender could be a mortgage bank, which specializes in mortgages; it could be a large commercial bank, a community bank or a credit union. The largest mortgage lenders, by share of originations, according to the publication Mortgage Daily, are <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>, <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span> and <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>. Ask a broker what he or she can offer that a bank can't and the response will almost certainly be variety. Because brokers are not tied to any one lender, they have the ability to shop around on behalf of their clients. As Mr. Frommeyer explained, ''I have 20 companies I can go to -- everybody has a different program.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In reality, these days, the variation in lenders' products and rates is much more limited than in the era of easy credit. ''When it comes to a 30-year fixed, the rate of pricing is pretty darn tight,'' said Bob Walters, the chief economist for Quicken Loans, a major online mortgage lender. ''We're not talking about huge differences.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a borrower might still save time and irritation by having an experienced broker shop around for the best mortgage deal. Borrowers who might not be shoo-ins for a loan, perhaps because of lagging credit or other circumstances, might find that a broker with lots of lending contacts will have a good sense of what the financing possibilities are, if any.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another plus for busy borrowers: Brokers handle the paperwork and interactions with lenders. And they may be able to head off problems. ''The broker understands the guidelines of the lender, and has the chance to look at your information before it is sent to the lender,'' said Tim Malburg, the president of the Capstone Mortgage Company, a brokerage in Wilton, Conn. ''Anything that raises a red flag, I'm going to ask you about.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of this is to suggest that borrowers should blindly trust a single broker to work on their behalf. After all, brokers get paid by closing loans. The borrower might check with two or three.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why a Bank?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If brokers offer clients variety, mortgage lenders have the advantage of control. Because the bank is the one lending the money, the bank makes the decisions. That can make a big difference in situations ''when you need a small exception, or a subjective decision is needed,'' said Mr. Walters of Quicken Loans. ''A banker can say, 'I'm going to fund this loan,' while a broker might get jammed up.'' Mistakes might also be resolved more quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Borrowers who have a long-term relationship with a bank for other services might be offered favorable terms on a home loan. And they might find that some mortgage products, like ''jumbo loans,'' are available only through a bank. (A jumbo loan exceeds the conforming-loan limits set by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, which in New York City and other high-cost areas is $625,500.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the secondary market for mortgages has shrunk so markedly, ''what's happened is more of the mortgage products available are available only through banks that have the capacity to hold those loans on their balance sheet,'' said Malcolm Hollensteiner, the director of retail lending sales at TD Bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, he said, although TD Bank can offer borrowers jumbo loans, brokers have far less access to jumbo products than they did before the housing crash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Better to Compare</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bottom line is that borrowers should compare offerings from both brokers and banks (whether online or at a bricks-and-mortar location). Mr. Malburg of Capstone recommends contacting three or four mortgage sources, and keeping track of their interest rates, lock-in fees and points on a spreadsheet. (Try to stick with a specific kind of loan, like a 30-year fixed, to simplify your comparison.) Then, he said, narrow it down, and call back to get details about closing costs, including lender origination fees, and whether there is a prepayment penalty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keep in mind that interest rates change constantly, so you may find that rates are different when you call back. ''You're chasing a moving target,'' Mr. Walters said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When comparing loan costs, be sure to ask how the broker is being compensated. The broker fee is set as a percentage of the loan amount (1 to 2.5 percent is customary), and is paid either by the borrower or the lender. Brokers are required to disclose their fees upfront, and they are not permitted to earn any more than the disclosed amount. On a $500,000 loan, a 1.5 percent broker fee would total $7,500. If due from the borrower, it could either be rolled into the loan amount or paid upfront by check.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Walters urges borrowers to look beyond cost considerations and also pay attention to how the broker or loan officer responds to their request for information. ''People say, 'How do I know if I'm talking to a good mortgage banker?' and I tell them, 'It's the person who asks you the most questions,' '' he said. ''Someone who is just quoting you rates, well, you might as well be buying gasoline.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The flat, low-slung neighborhood of Kakaako near downtown Honolulu was once an alluvial plain dotted with fish ponds that deteriorated into a gritty area with auto repair shops and warehouses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During an era of urban revitalization in the 1970s, the state formed the <span class="companylink">Hawaii Community Development Authority</span> to oversee neighborhood redevelopment in Kakaako, which lies between downtown Honolulu and Waikiki. Since then, Kakaako has evolved into a retail and entertainment district, with shopping centers and Honolulu's largest multiplex cinema, as well as a neighborhood popular with residential real estate investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kakaako's largest landowner, the <span class="companylink">Howard Hughes Corporation</span>, based in Texas, is poised to begin building three 400-foot residential condominium towers, the first phase of a development on 60 acres once owned by the family of Victoria Ward, a descendant of Hawaiian royalty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although an approved master plan for the development, called Ward Village, includes as many as 22 towers and more than a million square feet of retail and commercial space, to be built probably in the next 10 to 15 years, many of the projects in that plan would have to undergo later levels of review.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hughes corporation, which inherited the acreage and master plan when it emerged out of the bankrupt <span class="companylink">General Growth Properties</span> in 2009, has already been modifying some of the plans to take into account community concerns. While the proposed overall building density did not change, the developers narrowed the towers to preserve more of the ocean views enjoyed by inland residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, some residents have complained that Kakaako's 400-foot height limit for buildings is too high. While Howard Hughes continues to propose towers that are maximum height, developers are shifting the orientation of many to make them ''mauka-makai'' (Hawaiian for ''toward the mountains-toward the sea'') to preserve some vistas for islanders living outside the new buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers have agreed to survey the properties for native burial grounds, with guidance from the Oahu Island Burial Council.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Duane Komine, the second vice chairman of the Ala Moana/Kakaako Neighborhood Board No. 11, said the developers had solicited input and provided regular updates to affected residents, some islanders have lingering concerns. Larry Hurst, a resident of the area for more than 20 years, said some continued to complain that ocean views will be blocked, even though the development has already been approved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Unfavorable public interest has always been minimal and doesn't seem to be roused until a development is planned for next door,'' Mr. Hurst said. ''That's when people come out from behind their curtains.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hurst, who is chairman of the Ala Moana/Kakaako neighborhood board but was not speaking for the board, said he was concerned that the master plan did not include housing for poor people, but for people making an average income or above. Twenty percent of the 4,000 units proposed by Howard Hughes must be ''work force housing,'' or affordable to people earning 100 to 140 percent of the area's median income for a family of four, which is $86,300 in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While low-income residents might use public transportation, he said that he doubted the owners of luxury condos would, worsening issues with traffic congestion. ''They're not going to be straphangers,'' he said. ''They want to have their own cars. It's like that now -- people only have to go a couple of blocks, but they take their S.U.V.'s.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hurst said there had also been concerns in the community that a board of political appointees had made the decisions on a massive development that will transform the neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There exists a general feeling of mistrust that special deals are being made with land developers to benefit a select few as permits are influenced by an appointed commission, not by duly elected representatives,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The schedule for Ward Village's build-out will be driven by market demand, said Nick Vanderboom, a senior vice president for development at Howard Hughes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have a historically low level of new building permits for residential units in the last few years, and a shortage of supply of housing on Oahu,'' he said. ''We believe it will take 10 to 15 years, potentially longer, to redevelop the entire community.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Presales in Ward Village's three towers will begin in December or early next year, Mr. Vanderboom said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 38-story tower with townhomes called Waiea, which means ''water of life,'' will have 171 residences with one, two or three bedrooms. A 36-story tower with townhomes, called Anaha, will have 311 smaller apartments ranging from studios to three-bedroom apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 44-story unnamed tower, on Halekauwila Street, will have 424 residences, with 375 priced as work force housing. Unit pricing has not yet been determined, and construction should be complete by 2016, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides the three towers, Howard Hughes is also renovating a 1960s modernist-style office building that once housed <span class="companylink">IBM</span> into a Ward Village information center and residential sales gallery, to be completed in early 2014. Since 2010, more than 120,000 square feet of new retail space and a 720-space parking garage have also been added in Kakaako, Mr. Vanderboom said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The complete redevelopment of Kakaako would come close to tripling the population to at least 30,000 residents by 2030 from about 12,000 now, said Anthony J.H. Ching, the executive director of the Hawaii Community Development Authority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other big projects are also underway in Kakaako. Late last year, the state chose Forest City Hawaii, a subsidiary of <span class="companylink">Forest City Enterprises</span>, to develop what may be the state's tallest building, at 560 feet, as part of a $500 million transit-oriented complex on Pohukaina Street with a mix of affordable and market-rate residential units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another large landowner, Kamehameha Schools, has a 15-year plan to build as many as seven towers, up to 400 feet high, surrounded by low-rise units on its 29 acres.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several other tower projects are underway, such as Symphony, a residential condo tower with about 388 units, and Waihonua at Kewalo, a residential tower with about 400 units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the approved master plan for Ward Village, Howard Hughes can build a total of about 9.3 million square feet on its acreage, which besides the commercial space could amount to 4,000 residential units, Mr. Vanderboom said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In early November, Ward Village received the platinum level certification for eco-friendliness in neighborhood development from the <span class="companylink">United States Green Building Council</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The location of Ward Village's proposed development alone earned many points toward obtaining the platinum certification, said Aaron Welch, a senior planner and associate with Raimi and Associates, who consulted on the village plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For this project, the location -- which was infill, served by transit, near existing amenities like schools, shops, parks -- was one of the most important things in helping it score well,'' Mr. Welch said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond that, the plans include tree-lined and shaded streets, water-efficient landscaping, recycled content in the infrastructure, lights that minimize light pollution and reflective and vegetative roofs to minimize heat absorption, Mr. Welch said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with bicycle- and car-sharing programs, Ward Village plans to make use of bus service and a new light rail line under construction, to reduce reliance on automobiles, Mr. Vanderboom said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My wife and I live here, and we only own one car,'' he said. ''I'm fortunate to walk to work every day.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON — The number of Americans who signed contracts to buy homes fell in October for the fifth straight month, with higher mortgage rates, price increases and the 16-day partial government shutdown holding back sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/national_association_of_realtors/index.html?inline=nyt-org] said on Monday that its seasonally adjusted pending home sales index dipped 0.6 percent to 102.1. That is the lowest level since December. September’s reading was revised slightly higher to 102.7.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is generally a one- to two-month lag between a signed contract and a completed sale. The October drop suggested that final sales would remain weak in the coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors’ group said the government shutdown prevented the <span class="companylink">Internal Revenue Service</span> from verifying incomes, a critical part of the mortgage-approval process. The group said that 17 percent of Realtors reported delays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales could rebound a bit in November as purchases delayed by the shutdown are completed. But they were not expected to pick up much after that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The recovery in home sales has clearly at least stalled,” said Jim O’Sullivan, chief United States economist with High Frequency Economics, a forecasting firm. “With other data showing the recovery in the labor market still on track, and confidence moving up again, we expect home sales to start trending up again in coming months.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A limited supply of homes has pushed up prices in the past year. Prices of existing homes rose 12 percent in September from the previous year, according to the real estate data provider <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signed contracts fell sharply last month in the West, where investors have snapped up foreclosed homes and bid up prices in the past year. Signed contracts also slipped in the South, another area that was hit hard during the economic crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all, sales should rise about 10 percent this year to 5.1 million, the association says. About 4.67 million homes were sold in 2012.</p>

</div><div class="author">By JULIE CRESWELL   </div><div>1457 words</div><div>21 November 2013</div><div>International New York Times</div><div>INHT</div><div>17</div><div>English</div><div>© 2013 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Standing in the dining room of the early 1900s-era brick rowhouse, deep in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn with not a frozen yogurt shop or <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span> to be found, Alan Dixon, an investor from Australia, struggled to tally the houses he had bought in the area over the last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘What, 70? 72?’’ he asked, raising his eyebrows in question at a group of investors, contractors and designers standing nearby. A dozen construction workers scurried around, fastening plasterboard to walls and laying tile on floors, readying the four-bedroom house that the group purchased in June for $635,000 for leasing in less than two weeks’ time for as much as $5,490 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, someone located the number on a piece of paper — 70, later corrected to 71. ‘‘That sounds right. Something like that,’’ Mr. Dixon said with a laugh, tugging on the cuff of the pink shirt he wore under his gray suit jacket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s easy to understand why it might be difficult for Mr. Dixon to keep track. In just two years, the fund he oversees for Australian investors and retirees has purchased more than 538 homes, townhouses and brownstones from Jersey City to the New York City boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dixon and his investments in New York area residential real estate are a microcosm of a much bigger trend sweeping the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A handful of large private equity and real estate investment firms, including the <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group</span> and Colony Capital, have bought billions of dollars’ worth of single-family homes in areas severely affected by the housing collapse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The goal for these Wall Street investors is not to buy and flip the properties for a quick profit à la real estate bubble of the early 2000s. Instead, they are hunting for steady, dividend-like returns they believe can be earned by renting out the homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where these investors see opportunity, however, their critics see opportunists. They say these types of investors, be they giants like <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> or smaller firms like Mr. Dixon’s, often come in waving wads of cash and crowd out first-time home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Executives at the big firms defend the purchases, saying they prefer to buy dozens or even hundreds of homes in a single swoop at bank auctions where few first-time homeowners can participate because often payment must be in cash. Furthermore, they say they are gobbling up overhanging home inventories in crucial markets, supporting and even increasing overall home prices in these areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those arguments may hold up in places like Phoenix or Las Vegas, which were overbuilt during the boom and struggled when the housing market collapsed. But prices have soared in parts of the market that weathered the housing storm, like Brooklyn, increasingly frustrating the dreams of first-time home buyers, analysts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of a home in Brooklyn climbed nearly 12 percent in just the past year to hit a 10-year record, according to a recent report released by the real estate brokerage firm <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>. Prices for highly desirable one-family brownstones in Brooklyn have leapt almost 40 percent in the last year to a median price of $1.6 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some real estate agents say investors, more often than not, have been at the forefront of buying activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘I’d say by the spring, maybe 70 percent of the sales we were seeing were to hedge funds, investors and others taking advantage of what was happening in Brooklyn,’’ said Stephanie O’Brien, a real estate broker with <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span> in Brooklyn. ‘‘Only about 30 percent were actual end-users or first-time buyers.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The higher prices have changed the character and makeup of neighborhoods, often pushing more lower — and middle-income families farther east in the borough. ‘‘What’s happening is good, because it increases real estate values, but on the other hand people who have been living in these neighborhoods and hoping to one day buy or rent a larger apartment are getting priced out,’’ said Ron Schweiger, the Brooklyn borough historian.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dixon brushes aside assertions that his group’s investments have thwarted individual home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said many of the brownstones and other homes his group had purchased were vacant or single-room occupancy housing, requiring extensive repairs or remodeling, as well as successful navigation of the city’s labyrinth of agencies to obtain the necessary certificates and permits. He said his competition for homes tended to be small developers and construction firms interested in fixing up the homes and reselling them quickly for a profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Brooklyn real estate agents say Mr. Dixon’s group has been beaten out for properties by homeowners coming to the table with cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘I don’t see them as competition to the home buyer because they generally don’t bid as high as somebody who is going to be an end-user of the home,’’ said Deborah Rieders, a real estate agent with Corcoran in Brooklyn. ‘‘They’ve lost out on a lot of my listings because they were outbid by other buyers.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dixon entered the New York property market through Dixon Advisory, a wealth advisory firm in Canberra founded by his father, Daryl Dixon, a prominent Australian economist and investment consultant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During his travels to the United States in 2008 and 2009, Alan Dixon and others at the firm noted the steep decline in housing prices, wondering if there was an opportunity to pick up good homes at distressed prices in the New York area. In 2011, Dixon Advisory held an initial public offering for the <span class="companylink">US Masters Residential Property Fund</span>, a property trust that trades on the <span class="companylink">Australian Securities Exchange</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With an initial pool of 70 million Australian dollars raised from investors (the group now controls 380 million dollars, or $358 million, from more than 3,700 Australians), Mr. Dixon and his team bought their first homes in Hudson County, N.J., in 2011. They moved into Brooklyn about a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While his fund has sold a few properties already, Mr. Dixon says the general idea is to hold onto the properties, deriving steady income from rents. Mr. Dixon says that in the early years, as the fund invests in homes, renovates them and rents them, he expects returns could average about 5 percent each year. But as property values and rents increase, he estimates those returns could climb to 12 to 18 percent annually. If the homes are held for five years or longer, the income for the Australian investors will be taxed at a rate that Mr. Dixon says equals about 7.5 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like the bigger funds, Mr. Dixon and his team are betting that housing prices have stabilized in the United States. But his group also believes another demographic shift is occurring, of families coming back to cities and looking for bigger homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Mr. Dixon has a regret, it is not moving faster, especially in Brooklyn, where prices quickly began to climb. His group has been essentially priced out of well-established neighborhoods like Park Slope and Brooklyn Heights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Furthermore, some of the hottest areas of Brooklyn are seeing a wave of construction and conversions on the horizon to meet increased rental demands. Real estate agents say an estimated 2,700 rentals are expected to hit the Williamsburg market over the next six months, which they say could depress rents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has pushed Mr. Dixon and his group farther afield in Brooklyn, where they are buying up dilapidated brownstones like one on MacDonough Street in Stuyvesant Heights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gingerly stepping over holes in the floorboards while ducking under exposed electrical wiring dangling from the ceiling, Mr. Dixon pointed to a threadbare carpet on the floor when asked for the source of the dank smell filling the home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an upstairs bedroom, a steady flow of rainwater from the ceiling — much of the roof had to be removed because of asbestos — dripped down an interior wall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dixon’s firm purchased the home early this year for $539,000. Plans for expansion will push it 12 feet into the backyard, with an outdoor deck on top of the extension. He hopes to have it fixed up in time to rent next summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Driving between homes, Mr. Dixon hardly paused when asked what he and his partners could get wrong. ‘‘Crime,’’ he quickly answered, before rattling off statistics that he says show New York’s crime rate is low — relatively speaking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘Right now, these neighborhoods are benefiting from the low crime rate,’’ Mr. Dixon said. ‘‘But that is something we could get wrong if it went the other way.’’</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Plan to Redevelop South Street Seaport Includes Marina and 50-Story Tower</span>
</div><div class="author">By CHARLES V BAGLI </div><div>763 words</div><div>19 November 2013</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>21</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">South Street Seaport, an often-neglected corner of Manhattan dedicated to enshrining New York's seafaring past, has been battered by storms, recessions and poor management.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, there is a proposal for a major redevelopment of the cobblestone streets, 19th-century brick buildings and piers that would include the reconstruction of the landmark Tin Building and the addition of a marina and a 50-story hotel and apartment tower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">The Howard Hughes Corporation</span>, which controls the seaport under a lease with the city, says it wants to enliven the area and establish a destination for both tourists and New Yorkers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is unclear how a glassy tower on the north side of Pier 17 would fit into the historical fabric of the area, but Howard Hughes contends that the building would be the ''economic engine'' that would allow for the rehabilitation of the crumbling piers and nearby buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposal, the company said, will include a still-to-be-determined rescue plan for the financially ailing Seaport Museum, and the sailing ships at Pier 17, which are slowly sinking into the East River.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The re-envisioned seaport district will transform the piers' iconic waterfront setting into a vibrant, highly engaging area,'' said David R. Weinreb, chief executive of Howard Hughes, ''while providing a critical catalyst for the revitalization of Lower Manhattan.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company is to unveil its preliminary plan for the first time on Tuesday to local residents and members of Community Board 1, which includes the seaport.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Howard Hughes, which would triple the size of its operations, had hoped to continue negotiating in secret with the city's Economic Development Corporation while it completed its proposal. But demands by local officials and residents for a more open design process forced the company to make the plans public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company's proposal must be approved by the <span class="companylink">Landmarks Preservation Commission</span> and the City Council before construction can start.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Catherine M. Hughes, chairwoman of Community Board 1, said she was glad to finally see the developer's master plan, which appears to have met many of the community's concerns. ''We understand that in order for it to succeed and provide community amenities it needs to be economically viable,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Robert LaValva, who has run the New Amsterdam Market, a monthly bazaar that includes food-oriented entrepreneurs and purveyors at the seaport, is worried that the developer might rupture the ''coherence and integrity of the historic district.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Howard Hughes, for instance, wants to demolish the vacant and dilapidated New Market Building on the north side of Pier 17 so that it can build the hotel and apartment tower. ''That's the one and only existing historic building that connects the land to the waterfront,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Councilwoman Gale A. Brewer, who was recently elected Manhattan borough president and will take office in January, said she had reservations about the height of the apartment tower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before Howard Hughes, <span class="companylink">General Growth Properties</span> controlled the lease at the Seaport and in 2008 initiated its own plan for redeveloping the area, including a 42-story apartment tower. That plan was rejected by the landmarks commission before the company went into bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Weinreb said that it would cost about $125 million to rebuild the rotting wooden piers and dismantle and rebuild the Tin Building, which must be moved about 30 feet to the east and raised to meet new waterfront standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local streets would be extended to the piers in order to reintegrate the seaport into the surrounding neighborhood and preserve the views of the Brooklyn Bridge. The company would also build a marina between the apartment building and the Brooklyn Bridge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Howard Hughes is taking a very different approach than that taken by the Rouse Corporation in the 1980s, when it opened a ''festival marketplace'' in the historic district, hoping to attract tourists and suburban residents back to the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the city is awash in tourists, and the residential population downtown has swelled to 60,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Like it or not, the whole city is a festival market now,'' said Gregg Pasquarelli, a principal at SHoP Architects, who is working on the plan for Howard Hughes. ''We want to get New Yorkers to come to the seaport, where there'll be unique shops and history. The tourists will come anyway.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDPHILADELPHIA -- The financially troubled school district here is seeking buyers for more than two dozen school buildings that it shuttered last summer in one of the country's biggest school closing programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while one prospective developer, Municipal Acquisitions, a firm based in Washington, has offered $100 million for the entire portfolio, both Drexel and Temple Universities are considering the purchase of individual schools near their campuses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The school district published details on its website of 27 buildings, totaling about 3.7 million square feet, and the land they sit on, in the hope that the properties could be adapted and reused by buyers, who could provide the district with desperately needed cash. The public school system laid off 3,800 workers to close a $304 million budget deficit at the start of the current school year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The properties range from the former University City High School and its associated buildings covering 611,000 square feet on a prime West Philadelphia site near <span class="companylink">Drexel University</span>, to the building that housed Germantown High School, a 278,000-square-foot site in a low-income area of Philadelphia's northern section.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">District officials said the portfolio's overall value was being appraised. For eight properties that are subject to expedited sales because there has been a ''demonstrated interest,'' the appraised value should be known by Dec. 17; valuation for the remaining sites will come later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twenty-four schools, representing about 12 percent of the district's total, were closed at the end of the 2012-13 academic year because dwindling student populations had left them significantly underused, and they were draining scarce resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Municipal Acquisitions said its offer reflected real estate prices in the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We did a bottom-up evaluation of each individual property and our offer represented our opinion of full market value,'' Maria Pia Tamburri, a spokeswoman for the company, wrote in an email. ''We believe our approach is the fastest means to put these properties back to productive use.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Tamburri said the company saw ''numerous opportunities'' to repurpose or develop the buildings for future users, which may include public agencies. She said the school district had encouraged Municipal Acquisitions to participate in its bidding process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The offer is the only one so far for all the assets, said Fernando Gallard, a spokesman for the school district.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But <span class="companylink">Drexel University</span> has said it wants to buy University City High School for an undisclosed price, and restore it as a public school. <span class="companylink">Temple University</span> has expressed an interest in the former William Penn High School, close to its Temple campus on the north side of central Philadelphia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers interested in the eight properties undergoing an expedited sale have until Dec. 17 to respond to a request for qualification, the district said. For the other properties, buyers must submit an expression of interest by that date.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The district's superintendent, William R. Hite Jr., said the decision to seek formal bids was an aggressive effort to sell its unused real estate and represented the first time all the properties had been offered at once.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Previous sales by the school district took an average of one and a half years per property, and this wholesale effort would speed the process to try to ease the district's severe financial problems, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's an opportunity for us to gain revenue,'' Mr. Hite said in an interview. ''We are trying to sell these properties as quickly as possible for as much as we can get for them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other cities, school buildings have fetched lower-than-expected prices and have been slow to sell, according to a Pew Charitable Trusts report covering 12 cities. Since 2005, most school buildings have sold for $200,000 to $1 million, according to the report, published in February. In Cincinnati, for example, 11 buildings and one vacant parcel were auctioned in 2012 for $3.5 million, well below an official valuation, the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fran Burns, the Philadelphia district's chief operating officer, pointed to earlier sales of seven schools, which netted a market-value price of $26 million for the school system. ''The market was there for the properties that we've sold,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $100 million offer is among widely differing assessments of the portfolio's total value. The city's Office of Property Assessment estimated $200 million, while a researcher at the <span class="companylink">University of Pennsylvania</span>, Kenneth Steif, calculated that 23 of the schools were worth $152 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Steif, a doctoral student in the university's City &amp; Regional Planning Program, also estimated in a paper published on Nov. 6 that the University City High School building alone was worth $35 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he said his estimates, based on tax and other official data, ''could be completely wrong,'' and urged the city to use its ''high-resolution administrative data'' to more accurately calculate how much each school is worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some buildings are in impoverished neighborhoods and are in dire need of repair, reducing their attractiveness to developers and adding to the uncertainty over the total value of the portfolio. School officials have calculated that $4 billion needs to be spent districtwide to fix problems such as leaking roofs, lead paint and mold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gallard, the district spokesman, said that the school system had not been able to afford to maintain the buildings appropriately over the years and that purchasers would know they needed to make repairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Historical buildings always have challenges, and buyers understand that,'' Mr. Gallard said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average age of 23 of the buildings (those for which construction dates are available) is 78 years; six are at least 100 years old.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the release of millions of square feet of space on the market might be expected to depress Philadelphia's now-recovering commercial real estate prices, local experts said that was unlikely because of the unfavorable locations of some properties, and the high cost of redeveloping them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't think that these properties are going to have significant impact,'' said Greg Hill, a partner at D3, a local real estate development company. Mr. Hill argued that demand would be limited by the large size of the properties and their ''significant'' asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Silverman, managing director in the Philadelphia office of Integra Realty Resources, a valuation and consulting firm, said many of the buildings were outside central Philadelphia, some were obsolete, and some were in neighborhoods where residents might resist development for fear of higher taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Silverman declined to speculate on the buildings' aggregate value because he helped to set a value on some individual properties. But he said a single buyer would be the best solution in the district's view, because it would offer a quick infusion of needed cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: November 14, 2013, Thursday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on the Square Feet pages on Wednesday about properties being put up for sale by the School District of Philadelphia misstated the location of one such property, the building that housed Germantown High School.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It takes a certain kind of person to regard luxury real estate in New York as cheap, maybe even embarrassingly cheap when compared with other global capitals. If such people hail from the former Soviet Union, and want to add a Manhattan address to a portfolio that might already include homes in London or Dubai or St. Tropez, they might seek out a real estate agent who appreciates their unusual perspective. They might seek out Gennady Perepada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Believe me, it's absolutely normal people,'' Mr. Perepada said of his clientele, in Russian-accented English. ''Absolutely nice and classy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what is normal about paying several thousand dollars per square foot for an apartment you might visit once or twice a year? And if someone's budget is that outsized, just imagine what his expectations are for the services his broker will render.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Perepada -- who prefers the term international real estate consultant -- makes it his job not just to find his clients apartments but also to bend New York to their will, so that every wish is granted and every door is opened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Limousine doors and boutique doors and nightclub doors of course, but why stop there? ''New hip? No problem,'' Mr. Perepada said. ''Wife need plastic surgery? No problem.'' He is just getting started. ''Deliver baby? I know all the doctors. Russian speak. Rabbi, mullah. Lenox Hill, your own floor -- O.K., after Beyoncé that's hard,'' he conceded. But a private suite is, of course, no problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clients like the ones that Mr. Perepada serves were once rare in the upper echelons of the city's real estate. The most expensive buildings were filled with blue-blood Americans, and as for wealthy foreigners, they put their money in securities or Swiss banks. But today, foreign capital is a crucial force in the luxury market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Perepada's clients are not after the addresses on Park or Fifth Avenue that previous generations coveted. For one thing, those buildings require a degree of financial disclosure that few Russian plutocrats would ever consider. Instead, they gravitate to condominiums that are new or still under construction. Many of those buildings actively seek out foreign investors. Some even send representatives to Moscow, among other destinations, to reach potential buyers where they live or play.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Edward Mermelstein, a lawyer who represents investors abroad (including many of Mr. Perepada's clients), has advised developers on how to reach their audience in exclusive Moscow lounges and bars. ''Their attention is typically very short,'' he said. ''If you catch them at the right moment by basically sitting looking at a floor plan, whether it's One57 or 432 Park -- typically everyone knows each other in those rooms. They'll sit down for a cup of tea or coffee, and in those few moments you'll get enough attention to get a follow-up meeting.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Perepada does not represent the oligarchs who grab headlines with their nine-figure purchases. His clients are not quite billionaires, he says, just ''regular millionaires.'' He knows what they like: high ceilings, at least 3,000 square feet, full service, great views and, most of all, ease of transaction. Their reverence for Central Park has attracted them to One57, the new tower on West 57th Street, though no keys have yet changed hands. But he has also broadened their interest to buildings like 75 Wall Street and 60 Riverside Boulevard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His iPhone is loaded with images of panoramic penthouse vistas, gracious interiors and <span class="companylink">Google</span> Map street shots. By 4:30 a.m., he and the phone are typically in high gear, as he uses Skype and WhatsApp and FaceTime back and forth across time zones, in Ukrainian, Russian, Uzbek, Kazakh or even ''a bissel Yiddish.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he immigrated from Ukraine in 1990, Mr. Perepada took whatever job he could get. He worked at a flea market; he made deliveries; he drove a taxi. Along the way, he helped much of his family immigrate and settle in Sheepshead Bay, where he still lives. Ten years ago, he made his way into real estate, selling ordinary apartments. He liked the work but not the size of the commissions, so he set his sights higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He found the ultrarich to be surprisingly pleasant company. ''How they say in English, communicate?'' he asked. ''I know psychology. I love philosophy. I can talk to them about anything.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He makes himself useful by overseeing not only their real estate purchases, but also all of the secondary needs that such purchases generate, like further construction, decorating, furniture and even clothes to hang in the closets. In the process, he becomes an expert in his clients' taste. What is their favorite type of bed linen? Their preferred silverware? Do they want Venetian stucco on the wall? No, wait, paint instead? O.K., now change it to wallpaper? No problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When they visit, he tries to anticipate their desires -- not just making them a reservation at their favorite restaurant, but also remembering that they prefer the four-top by the window. He says the smell inside helicopter cabins can be ''depressing.'' So he goes to the heliport and sprays air freshener before they arrive. ''My wife sometimes tells me, 'Can you treat me one day like you treat your clients?' '' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He collects a commission on apartment sales, split with the seller's broker. As for the deluxe concierge services that go along with them, he declines to say how, or whether, he charges. Discussing financial transactions between friends is uncouth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Perepada takes his job very seriously. But once in a while, as he rattles off the kinds of details he attends to for his clients' satisfaction, he cracks himself up. ''It's a joke!'' he says, his eyes wide. A moment later he is back to dead earnest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is absolutely -- I tell you, absolutely normal people,'' he said. ''Someone tells you different, they're lying.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE commercial real estate market, particularly for offices, has turned upward this year, with banks saying that they have reduced lending standards at the same time that demand for mortgage loans has risen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Board</span> reported this week that 21.9 percent of banks surveyed last month said they had eased credit standards for commercial real estate loans in the third quarter of this year, while only 2.7 percent reported tighter standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As can be seen from the accompanying charts, the net loosening figure of 19.9 percent was down a bit from the second quarter but otherwise was the highest such figure since 2005, when the real estate bubble was still inflating. At the same time, more banks reported rising demand for commercial real estate loans than at any time since 1998.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is somewhat anecdotal, but it feels like we've seen a consistent increase in availability of debt capital in commercial real estate this year,'' said Ross L. Smotrich, a senior analyst of real estate investment trusts for <span class="companylink">Barclays</span>. A year ago, he said, ''the banks were willing to lend to highest-quality borrowers, but recently there is more interest in lending'' on lower-quality properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Smotrich said the demand first rose in gateway cities, including New York, Boston and San Francisco, but has started to spill over to other markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That rebound has led to a substantial increase in the volume of new commercial mortgage-backed securities, which this year could total $80 billion, estimated Joe McBride, an analyst for <span class="companylink">Trepp L.L.C</span>., which follows the market. That would be up from $44 billion in 2012, but still below every year from 2004 through 2007, when the issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities peaked at $230 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of those loans were highly speculative, and ended up defaulting. And while loan delinquencies are declining -- and in October were the lowest proportion since 2010 -- the figures are still high by historical standards. Moreover, defaults in some areas, like multifamily residential projects and industrial buildings, have come down only a little bit from the peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, there appears to be increasing demand for new securitizations. Investors crave yield, and there is not much of that available with interest rates so low. And there is a confidence that lenders are being far more responsible now than they were during the bubble years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2007, the average deal had income equal to only 1.4 times the debt service payments required on the securitization. In 2008, when the few deals done included some of the most speculative loans made before the bubble burst, that was down to 1.2, according to Trepp calculations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But so far this year, the ratio is 2.2, which would seem to indicate that lending standards are much higher, notwithstanding banks saying their standards are looser than they were earlier in the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rising volume of new securitizations has not been enough to offset the decline in the total amount outstanding, caused by repayments and, to a lesser extent, defaults. At the end of October, the total amount outstanding in commercial mortgage-backed securitizations was $525 billion, 8 percent below the figure of a year earlier and 35 percent below the record of $803 billion set at the end of 2007.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tama Robertson is an artist who sells paintings and makes jewelry, but this being New York City, she also works in real estate. She has worked as an associate broker and invested in some properties of her own, but in recent years, she has supplemented her income with something a bit more contentious: She rents out a room in her own apartment to travelers she finds on the website <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By sharing her kitchen and her keys with strangers, she estimates that she brings in up to $10,000 a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Airbnb</span> is a service that is adored by some, despised by others, and most commonly known as a place to rent out your apartment while you're out of town for a few days. But doing so is often illegal in New York City, one reason the company has locked horns with the New York State attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A huge amount of money hangs in the balance of this dispute, including revenue for <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span>, as well as untold millions in hotel tax dollars that the attorney general says <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span> has been costing the state every year. Also at stake is a discrete little economy, populated by New Yorkers who make a substantial portion of their income by renting out apartments on a short-term basis through the website, sometimes legally and sometimes not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Last year we made about $90,000 from this business,'' said Leslie, who rents out two rooms in her two-family house in Brooklyn through <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leslie, a stay-at-home mother who is married to a teacher, agreed to speak only if her address and last name were withheld. So did Joe, who said his ''dedicated <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span> room,'' which brings in about $2,000 per month that he splits with his two roommates, allowed him to start a small technology company. And P., a musician who rents out two apartments in Manhattan and one in Brooklyn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One man, however, declined to be identified by his extremely common first name, by his profession or even by the state in which he lives. Instead he described himself as ''one of the people they really want to get.'' He operates empty New York City apartments as short-term rentals, none of which he lives in, a practice he called ''beyond lucrative.'' It also happens to generally be illegal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In most residential apartment buildings, renting out your space for less than 30 days is illegal, unless you are present when you have that visitor. The restriction does not apply to single- or two-family homes, like Leslie's, but zoning laws may still limit the practice. Leases and building bylaws may also forbid it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, even those whose rental side business might surmount legal hurdles were skittish about being identified. Sometimes they did not want their neighbors to know. But they were also worried that the state might choose to make an example of them. Mr. Schneiderman has subpoenaed <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span> for transaction information on many of its New York users, and the company is fighting to keep the information private.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the attorney general's office, based on information given to it by <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span>, the top 40 <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span> hosts in New York have each grossed at least $400,000 over the past three years, a collective total of over $35 million. The top 100 hosts in that time period have grossed $54 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We began this process in the hopes of collaborating with <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span> to recover millions of dollars in unpaid taxes and to stop the abuse of <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span>'s site by operators of illegal hotels,'' Matt Mittenthal, a spokesman for Mr. Schneiderman, said in an email. ''<span class="companylink">Airbnb</span> isn't standing up for average New Yorkers who rent out their apartments from time to time -- <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span> is standing up for highly profitable, illegal businesses that make up a huge chunk of its corporate revenue.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some building management companies have begun clampdowns of their own. One of them, TF Cornerstone, recently sent a letter to all of its rental tenants saying that subletting their apartments short-term on websites ''creates an overall security risk'' and also violates their lease. Another company, Dermer Management, reminded residents in some of its condo buildings that though Super Bowl weekend might seem like a great time to rent out their apartments for extra cash, the buildings' sublet policy forbids it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span> and its hosts say that they serve an important economic function in the city, helping travelers on a budget visit a place so expensive it might otherwise be out of reach, and that they bring those tourists to areas where they might not otherwise go.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's important to remember that almost 90 percent of our hosts have only one listing and it's the home they live in,'' said David Hantman, head of global public policy for <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span>. ''They have asked for a lot of data on regular New Yorkers, and we don't want to turn it over.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Robertson, who began renting out space in her apartment when an illness resulted in high medical bills in a difficult economy, said she had guests only when she was at home. And both she and Leslie, the stay-at-home mother in Brooklyn, said they had declared all of the money they had earned on <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span> as income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Show me the law, and I'll follow it,'' said Leslie, who is in the process of hiring an expediter to help her navigate zoning restrictions against the practice. ''When I ask five different lawyers what the law actually means, I get five different answers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as several hosts pointed out, letting a stranger use your shower is not for everybody, and there are those who will always prefer to stay in a hotel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This spring, my own family was in town looking at colleges and they refused to stay here -- they stayed in a hotel,'' said Susan, who owns a small consulting business and rents out a room in her co-op apartment. ''There are people who want complete privacy and room service, and they're willing to pay for that. It doesn't matter how many good reviews I have, my family's not staying here.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She still finds plenty of takers, though. She said the rental income from that one room made up about half of her income.</p>

</div><div class="author">By MICHELLE HIGGINS </div><div>2383 words</div><div>3 November 2013</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Queens, the city's most sprawling borough, has long been a landing pad for new arrivals and those looking for a cheaper alternative to Manhattan. Over the decades, newcomers from practically every corner of the world have moved in, making it the most diverse borough in New York City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With rents and real estate prices on the rise in Manhattan and Brooklyn, young professionals and families in particular have gradually been following the subway lines east of Manhattan and beyond Long Island City to Astoria, Jackson Heights and other traditionally working-class enclaves in northwest Queens. Close on their heels, developers have been scouting out sites to build housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Brooklyn evolved from being a cheaper alternative to Manhattan and has become a focus of new development and a destination,'' said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel. ''As the search for affordability expands and as the economy and the housing market improves, you're seeing Queens is sort of next in line.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Queens in the third quarter, the median sales price of $372,000 was almost even with last year's third-quarter figure, according to a report compiled by Mr. Miller for <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman Real Estate</span>. Meanwhile, the median sales price in Brooklyn hit a 10-year high, rising to $564,720 in the third quarter. The price discrepancy was greater in the luxury category, where the third-quarter median was $1.7 million in Brooklyn and $889,000 in Queens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Renters, too, have found relief in Queens. The average monthly rent there rose 5.2 percent, to $1,574, in the 12 months ending in June, according to the latest numbers available from the real estate research firm <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>. But over that same period, Queens rents were still cheaper than those in Brooklyn ($1,692) and Manhattan ($3,814).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nudged by rising land prices and a diminishing number of sites zoned for large-scale development in Manhattan and Brooklyn, major developers have been venturing into Queens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the next three years, more than 8,000 apartments are planned for Long Island City and parts of Astoria, according to estimates from Aptsandlofts.com, a New York brokerage that specializes in the marketing of developments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year, New Jersey-based Treetop Development acquired Saxon Hall, a 417-unit doorman building in the heart of Rego Park, for $85.25 million. It has plans to upgrade the mechanical systems, add a gym and a roof deck, and modernize the lobby and any vacant units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June, <span class="companylink">Vornado Realty Trust</span> received approval from the Department of Buildings for a 314-unit luxury apartment tower above its Rego Park shopping mall. And this fall, <span class="companylink">the Rockefeller Group</span> and TDC Development and Construction are to start on an $850 million mixed-use project on five acres in downtown Flushing, with more than 600 apartments, a Y.M.C.A., stores and open space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The catalyst for the growing interest, brokers and developers say, is the success of Long Island City, just across the East River from Manhattan, where some condos have been selling for more than $1,000 a square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Many developers we're working with started out in Long Island City and are now moving to other areas of Queens,'' said Eric Benaim, the chief executive of the Modern Spaces brokerage, which has offices in Long Island City and Astoria. ''They were able to see the potential with Long Island City and are now open to doing projects in other areas.'' Industry executives like to draw comparisons between the quickening pace of development in Queens and the rapid transformation of Brooklyn over the last few years. With prices skyrocketing in prime parts of Brooklyn like Cobble Hill and Williamsburg, said Michael Tortorici, a founder of Ariel Property Advisors, ''now you have other areas that used to be considered second- or third-tier, like Crown Heights and Bushwick, catching up very quickly.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Queens, he continued, ''I think you can see the market following the same pattern,'' with momentum from Long Island City and Astoria carrying into Elmhurst, Flushing and beyond.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that is where the comparisons end. Queens may be on the rise, but it lacks the buzz that has turned Brooklyn into a global brand. Still, Queens fans say that is precisely why they like it. ''Queens is Queens,'' said Rich Buceta, the president of SingleCut Beersmiths, a new brewery in Astoria. ''It basically doesn't have to live up to any sort of hype or image like, say, Manhattan or Brooklyn. Queens is much more low-key. It's much more unassuming. We're not trendy. We're not trying to appeal to the latest fad.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astoria</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long known as a Greek immigrant neighborhood, but home to many other ethnicities, Astoria has been rapidly gaining popularity with young professionals first lured across the river by Long Island City, its trendier and pricier next-door neighbor. In Long Island City, the average rent in a luxury building is $3,650 a month, while in Astoria it is $2,520, according to Modern Spaces brokerage, which opened an Astoria office last year to capture some of that business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Development is on the way along Astoria's waterfront. Last month, Lincoln Equities Group was given the go-ahead to build Hallets Point, a $1 billion project to include 1,921 market-rate and 483 below-market-rate apartments on seven and a half acres on a promontory that juts out into Hell Gate, at the convergence of the East and Harlem Rivers. The project, which will be near the Astoria Houses, a public development, will have Manhattan views, a supermarket, retail space and a waterfront esplanade designed by James Corner Field Operations, which worked on the High Line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And 2030 Astoria Developers, headed by John Mavroudis of the Queens group Alma Realty, is eyeing a nearby site for a large residential development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astoria, which borders Long Island City at 36th Avenue and stretches from the East River to 49th Street, limits large-scale development in some of its better-established residential areas. But transformation has arrived in the shape of trendy restaurants and shops and low-rise apartment buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just last month, <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span> began leasing apartments in an eight-story 192-unit building at 12-15 Broadway near Socrates Sculpture Park and a taxicab graveyard. The marketing of the building, called Astoria Archaeology, celebrates the grittier aspects of the neighborhood (witness the cab graveyard) as well as Manhattan skyline views, a roof deck, a yoga studio, a fitness center and on-site parking. Monthly rents begin at $1,980 for studios, $2,320 for one-bedrooms and $3,325 for two-bedrooms. In addition, an incentive of two months' free rent is being offered this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Developers are beginning to realize the infrastructure is there, the proximity to the subways is there,'' said Hal G. Rosenbluth, the president of Kaufman Astoria Studios, the film production center where the Marx Brothers shot ''Animal Crackers'' in 1930, and where ''Sesame Street'' is produced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All but abandoned in the late 1970s, the complex today has grown, helping to reinvigorate the neighborhood. It encompasses the recently renovated Museum of the Moving Image, the Frank Sinatra School of the Arts, the Queens Council on the Arts, and retail and restaurant outposts like <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span> coffee, a United Artists movie theater and the Astor Room, a dinner and brunch spot that was once the studio commissary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last year, several bars, restaurants and boutiques have opened or expanded to larger spaces on surrounding blocks, including Mar's, a restaurant where bartenders, dressed in their bow-tied speakeasy best, serve up $12 cocktails; and Lockwood, a boutique selling colorful furniture, clothing and gifts where</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I loveAstoria'' sweatshirts are a best seller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Astoria's Ditmars neighborhood, recent openings include <span class="companylink">Buffalo Exchange</span>, the consignment-shop chain with older outposts in Cobble Hill, Williamsburg and the East Village, and SingleCut Beersmiths, which arrived in December. But the neighborhood retains some of its Greek flavor. One example, at the corner of Ditmars Boulevard and 33rd Street, is MP Taverna, which bills itself as ''a modern interpretation of a traditional Greek tavern.'' It has opened across the street from the venerable Thessaloniki Jewelry, which has signs in both English and Greek.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sunnyside</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">South of Astoria and six stops on the No. 7 train from Grand Central Terminal, Sunnyside is attracting similar interest from Brooklyn transplants in search of cheaper rents. Much of the housing in the neighborhood is six-story apartment buildings dating to the 1920s and '30s. Sunnyside Gardens, about 16 blocks of mainly two-and three-story 1920s rowhouses constructed around central courtyards, was designated a historic district by the <span class="companylink">Landmarks Preservation Commission</span> in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the busy summer rental season, said Marco Maisto, a real estate agent at Citi Habitats who lives in Sunnyside, there was an uptick in interest in the neighborhood from ''hipsters'' under 40. ''Almost all had Brooklyn on their mind,'' he said, ''but found the prewar apartments out here bigger and by far more affordable.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a year of paying $900 a month for a tiny room in a three-bedroom walk-up with two roommates in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, Natalie Minott was ready for a change. Ms. Minott, who is pursuing a master's degree in interior design at Pratt Institute, rented a one-bedroom in Sunnyside for $1,200 a month. That's roughly $700 less, she said, than the ''tiny'' studios she toured in Manhattan and Brooklyn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though her commute to class in Brooklyn varies between 30 and 45 minutes with a train transfer, she appreciates being able to zip into Manhattan on the 7 train in 15 minutes. And she likes Sunnyside's under-the-radar quality. ''It's not overly priced as of yet,'' she said, ''and it doesn't feel the need to be the most progressive, trendy neighborhood. It's definitely a hidden gem.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least nine businesses have opened in Sunnyside in the past year to cater to new residents, including Venturo Osteria and Wine Bar, a seasonal Italian farm-to-table restaurant; a children's ballet studio; and a boutique selling items for pets, according to Sunnyside Shines Business Improvement District.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jackson Heights</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another neighborhood that has become a destination popular with couples and families in search of space and affordability is Jackson Heights. Though it lacks the fashion-forward restaurants, bars and boutiques popping up in other parts of northwest Queens, it offers easy access to Manhattan on the E, F, R, G and 7 trains, and hundreds of ethnic restaurants representing its diverse population.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Airy prewar co-ops abound in the Jackson Heights Historic District, which runs roughly from 76th to 88th Street, between Roosevelt Avenue and Northern Boulevard. Here, a one-bedroom in need of renovation can be had for about $150,000; a three-bedroom in pristine condition for $700,000, according to Rhoda Dunn, an agent with Corcoran. Buildings like the Towers and the Chateau, with formal living and dining rooms and fireplaces, and large layouts that make the most of light and breezes, tend to command the highest prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investor activity in Jackson Heights has picked up in recent months. In July, for example, Benedict Realty Group, which specializes in the middle-income market, announced the purchase of 561 units across a 19-building portfolio in Jackson Heights and its Queens neighbors Elmhurst and Corona for about $68 million. Eight of the buildings were in Jackson Heights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Citi Habitats is handling rentals in a failed condominium at 40-07 73rd Street that looks out on the raised subway tracks at Roosevelt Avenue and Broadway, where many train lines converge. The 31-unit building's one-, two- and three-bedrooms have floor-to-ceiling windows -- some of which face the subway -- as well as two full baths and private outdoor space. Leasing began Oct. 19; prices start at $2,400 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year Linda Pitmon and Steve Wynn, both musicians, left their Upper West Side rental and bought a two-bedroom with inlaid oak floors and a working fireplace on the top floor of Laburnum Court, a prewar co-op, for about $430,000. Part of the draw was the space their money could buy. ''I'm amazed that places out in Queens are so affordable,'' Mr. Wynn said, ''especially when people are tripping over themselves to outbid each other for places in Brooklyn and Manhattan.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They were also taken by the neighborhood's diversity. ''When I moved to New York, my desire was not to go live among people just like me,'' said Ms. Pitmon, quickly adding, ''not that there is anything wrong with people like me.'' But the Upper West Side is no longer the picture of diversity it was when she arrived nearly 20 years ago, she said. ''I wanted that being-in-the-melting-pot feel.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Jackson Heights, that feeling is definitely there, she said, rattling off a partial list of ingredients -- ''from Nepalese and Himalayan, Indian and Pakistani, all the Pacific islands, Korea, Thailand. There's a whole Eastern European population. It's incredible.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple are so excited about their new neighborhood they have been recruiting friends and have abbreviated Jackson Heights to ''the Jax.'' ''T-shirts will be coming soon,'' Ms. Pitmon joked.</p>
<p>From top: a view of Sunnyside,  among the Queens  neighborhoods that have been  drawing a new generation of  home-seekers away from more  expensive Manhattan and  Brooklyn. Shoppers and  pedestrians hit the sidewalk in  Jackson Heights, another  target area. Al Grant, a retiree,  looks out over the East River  from Astoria Park.

Linda  Pitmon and Steve Wynn, both  musicians, left Manhattan and  bought a place in a prewar  co-op in Jackson Heights.; Architectural variety abounds  in Queens, including, in  descending order: houses at  39th Place at 43rd Avenue in  Sunnyside; the newly built  Astoria Archaeology at 12-15  Broadway; and the 1917  Greystone in Jackson Heights.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every month, Leonard Steinberg, a leading broker at <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span> who has been responsible for more than $2 billion in residential real estate transactions, largely in downtown Manhattan, publishes something called The Luxury Letter. The report combines various listings -- for $9 million duplexes in Chelsea, for a $44.9 million ''loft mansion'' in TriBeCa -- with Mr. Steinberg's insights on the high-end property market and the city more generally. Titled ''Mayoral Issues: A Tale of Two Cities?'' the October editor's note recommended that the city's presumptive next leader, Bill de Blasio, devise a ''worst tenants'' list, and cautioned those who criticize Michael R. Bloomberg that a mayor's role is to be ''effective C.E.O. of the city, not 'best friend.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A champion of the Teterboro class, a man we imagine having greeted Occupy Wall Street with a call for Rigaud candles and fumigation, Mr. Steinberg late last month was surprised to be attending a fund-raiser for Mr. de Blasio. The impetus was a call from the real estate impresario Steve Witkoff, developer of the luxury West Village condominium complex 150 Charles, which has a $35 million penthouse and which <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span> represents. Mr. Witkoff was holding an event for Mr. de Blasio in his Upper East Side home. ''I thought if he's met Bill de Blasio and formed a personal impression, I want to know more,'' Mr. Steinberg told me. After spending some time with the candidate, he was moved to make a donation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In their conversation, Mr. Steinberg shared a long-held obsession with Mr. de Blasio -- the seemingly arbitrary way tax assessments are determined, leaving some property owners to grossly overpay and some to underpay. ''I said, 'If you are the mayor of fairness, you have to do something about this,' '' Mr. Steinberg recounted. ''And he said, 'Leonard, I'm definitely going to look into this.' He gave me a credible look in the eye, an I'm-going-to-do-something-about-this look, not a political BS look.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The exchange reflects Mr. de Blasio's potentially dubious gift for ecumenical connection. The idea that a de Blasio administration would alienate the wealthy, that the wealthy would revolt against relatively slight tax increases and move to Miami, that they would endure any significant marginalization in the narrative of the city, seems to be losing its currency. Mr. de Blasio has reached out to the real estate community; there have been several industry fund-raisers for him. It could hardly be otherwise. ''People talk about Wall Street, but even before '07, '08, it was really real estate that was the A.T.M. of New York,'' Steven Spinola, president of a powerful lobbying group, the Real Estate Board of New York, told me.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past fiscal year, city revenue from taxes on income-producing property was greater than revenue from sales and income taxes combined. Real estate-related taxes (including property, commercial rent, mortgage recording, transfer and hotel occupancy taxes) totaled $22.6 billion, roughly a third of the city's total budget. ''This is one reason I believe things will go well,'' Mr. Spinola told me. ''We have an interest in seeing that he'' -- Mr. de Blasio -- ''is successful, and if we are successful, Mayor de Blasio will be able to fund the things he wants to fund.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the economy sustains itself, it is hard to imagine the enormously wealthy suffering a diminished role in the psyche of the city in the coming years. In March, Knight Frank, a London-based real-estate consulting firm, issued a report forecasting that the number of H.N.W.I.'s (high-net-worth individuals, or those with over $30 million in assets, as the jargon goes) would increase by 36 percent in New York by 2022. Other cities are expected to experience a higher percentage increase, but New York is predicted to have more of these individuals than any other city in the world. Compared with several of those global capitals, ultraluxury real estate in New York -- at an average of $4,100 a square foot -- is relatively inexpensive. In Hong Kong it is $11,000 a square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are certainly those in the real estate industry who worry about the impact of higher taxes, even though studies repeatedly show that people are unlikely to move when taxes go up. (Last year, in fact, the British ''stamp duty'' increased to 7 percent from 5 percent on property transactions over a certain amount, and buying in England did not slow.) And yet even those who harbor concern mostly refuse to buy into the meme that a progressive city government would inevitably result in a New York of crack dens and subway muggings. ''No sane person believes we are turning the clock back to the Dinkins days,'' Fred Peters, president of Warburg Realty, said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As it happens, it was the implication of such a regression, in Joseph J. Lhota's notorious campaign ad last month, that has left many in the real estate world aghast. At the fund-raiser Mr. Steinberg attended, he said: ''There were many heavy hitters in the room, many of them Republican. And people were outraged. It was the sort of ad a group of kids might fall for, but not educated adults.'' The sentiment was very much, ''What idiot came up with that?''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON — Home prices rose in August from a year earlier at the fastest pace since February 2006. But the price gains slowed in many cities from July, a sign that rising prices over the last year may have peaked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other reports released on Tuesday showed that consumer confidence fell sharply this month as the federal government was partly shut down for 16 days, while retail sales dipped in September. And inflation at the wholesale level was negligible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Standard &amp; Poor’s/Case-Shiller  [http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/s/standard_poors_caseshiller_home_price_index/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] 20-city home price index rose 12.8 percent over the 12 months that ended in August. That compares with 12.4 percent in July from a year earlier. All 20 cities showed year-over-year gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a measure of month-over-month prices for the 20 cities rose just 1.3 percent in August. That is down from a 1.8 percent month-over-month gain in July. And 16 of the 20 cities reported more modest price increases in August than in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greater demand and a tighter supply of homes for sale have helped drive prices higher over the last year. But over the summer, mortgage rates rose from their record lows. Weak job growth is also discouraging potential home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ellen Haberle, an economist with the national real estate agency Redfin, said prices had been driven higher by a limited supply of houses on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span> said its index of consumer confidence dropped to 71.2 in October, down from 80.2 the previous month. September’s figure was slightly higher than initially reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers grew particularly pessimistic in their outlook on the economy six months from now, while their assessment of current economic conditions declined much less severely. They also expect less hiring in the months ahead. Consumers’ confidence is closely watched because their spending accounts for 70 percent of economic activity, and a decline in confidence is likely to reduce economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A sharp drop in auto sales caused overall retail sales to dip 0.1 percent, the Commerce Department reported. That was the weakest showing since March, as auto sales fell 2.2 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Excluding autos, gas and building supplies, retail sales rose 0.5 percent in September from 0.2 percent in August. Economists exclude those categories because they tend to be volatile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And a big decline in food costs helped hold down wholesale prices in September, contributing to a 0.1 percent decline, the first drop since April. The slight dip followed a 0.3 percent rise in the producer price index  [http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/p/producer_price_index/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] in August, the <span class="companylink">Labor Department</span> said on Tuesday. Wholesale food prices  [http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/f/food_prices/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] fell 1 percent. The lower food costs helped offset a 0.5 percent rise in energy prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, the so-called core producer price index rose a slight 0.1 percent in September and a modest 1.2 percent over the last 12 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a positive note, businesses increased their inventories in August, a sign that they expected stronger demand for their products. Inventories rose 0.3 percent in August compared with July, when they rose 0.4 percent, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales also rose, climbing 0.3 percent in August after a 0.6 percent increase in July.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Updated, 4:20 p.m. |</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stock market investors continue to show an appetite for real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Brixmor Property Group</span>, a real estate investment trust owned by the Blackstone Group[http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=BX&amp;inline=nyt-org], sold more shares than it had expected in its initial public offering on Tuesday evening, reflecting strong demand from investors. The shares were priced at $20 each, the middle of an expected range, raising $825 million and giving the company a market value of about $5.9 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stock rose on Wednesday in the company’s trading debut on the New York Stock Exchange[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/new_york_stock_exchange/index.html?inline=nyt-org]. After opening at $20.65, shares of Brixmor were up as much as 4 percent during the day before closing at $20.40.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Our story really resonated with investors, and that led to more demand that allowed us to upsize,” Michael A. Carroll, the chief executive of Brixmor, said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors are looking to gain exposure to the strengthening commercial real estate market in the United States. Vacancy rates are expected to decline for commercial properties and rents are expected to grow modestly, the National Association of Realtors[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/national_association_of_realtors/index.html?inline=nyt-org] said in a forecast released in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October, the <span class="companylink">Empire State Realty Trust</span> raised $929.5 million in an initial public offering. Its shares, through Tuesday, have risen 9 percent from the I.P.O. price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors are betting that Brixmor, which has 522 shopping centers across the country, is poised to benefit from the improving property market. The company says it has the nation’s largest wholly owned portfolio of shopping centers anchored by grocery stores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company, formerly known as the <span class="companylink">Centro Properties Group</span>, was in need of capital before <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> bought it in 2011. Since then, Brixmor has invested $339 million to improve its assets, the company said in a regulatory filing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brixmor said it planned to use the proceeds from the offering to reduce its debt. As of June 30, its total debt was about $6.7 billion, according to the filing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company sold 41.3 million shares in the offering, more than the 37.5 million shares it had expected to sell. The deal’s underwriters have the option to purchase an additional 6.2 million shares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> will remain the majority owner, with about 73 percent of the company’s shares, according to a filing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The offering was led by Bank of America[http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=BAC&amp;inline=nyt-org]Merrill Lynch[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/merrill_lynch_and_company/index.html?inline=nyt-org], Citigroup[http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=C&amp;inline=nyt-org], JPMorgan Chase[http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=JPM&amp;inline=nyt-org] and Wells Fargo[http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=WFC&amp;inline=nyt-org] Securities.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON — Americans bought fewer existing homes in September than in the previous month, held back by higher mortgage rates and rising prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said on Monday that sales of previously owned homes fell 1.9 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.29 million. That is down from a pace of 5.39 million in August, which was revised lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales pace in August equaled July’s pace. Both were the highest in four years and are consistent with a healthy market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates rose significantly over the summer, threatening to slow a recovery in housing that began last year and had helped drive modest economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many economists expect home sales will remain healthy because rates have stabilized. Final sales in September reflected contracts signed in July and August, when rates were about a percentage point higher than in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage was 4.28 percent last week, down from a two-year high of 4.58 percent in August and below the 30-year average of 7 percent, according to Bankrate.com[http://Bankrate.com].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes have risen a healthy 10.7 percent in the last 12 months. Still, that is the slowest year-over-year increase in five months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median home price has risen 11.7 percent in the past year, to $199,200, the Realtors association said. That is also the slowest annual gain in the five months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price increases may be slowing because more homes are coming on the market. The supply of available homes rose 1.8 percent from a year ago, to 2.21 million, the first year-over-year increase in two and a half years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A limited number of homes for sale is a major reason prices have risen so fast in the last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy is growing modestly and employers are adding jobs at a slow but steady pace. That has helped a growing number of Americans buy homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, many first-time buyers have been unable to enter the market. They made up just 28 percent of purchases in September, down from 32 percent a year ago. In healthier housing markets, they typically make up at least 40 percent of buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time buyers are having trouble qualifying for loans because many banks have adopted tougher lending restrictions and higher down-payment requirements since the housing bubble burst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, investors and Americans willing to pay cash are playing an outsize role in sales. Cash purchases made up 33 percent of September’s sales, up from 28 percent a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Borrowing rates began to rise in May after the Federal Reserve’s chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, suggested that the Fed could start to slow its $85 billion in monthly bond purchases by the end of the year. The purchases are intended to keep interest rates low and stimulate the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Fed decided against slowing its purchases at its September meeting, citing weak economic data and budget battles in Washington.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FIRST-TIME visitors to Humewood Castle in Kiltegan, County Wicklow, can’t help it. They simply say, “Wow.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s that big, that stunning — that, well, fairy tale. It’s vast and turreted, and the view toward the mountains looks like a Hollywood backdrop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Humewood, an Irish estate on 427 acres, roughly a 90-minute drive from Dublin, includes 15 bedrooms, a ballroom, a banqueting hall and a billiards room, among other amenities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And an American, John Malone, now owns it. Last November, the 72-year-old billionaire chairman of the cable and telecom giant <span class="companylink">Liberty Global</span> got it for a song.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He paid around 8 million euros, or roughly $10 million, for the 32,668-square-foot granite Victorian Gothic bastion, built in the 1860s. That’s about a third of what it sold for in 2006, near the height of the boom in the Irish economy. That year, it was bought for 25 million euros by an Irish real estate developer, Lalco Holdings, which had planned to develop it as one of Ireland[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/great-homes-and-destinations/destinations/europe/index.html?inline=nyt-geo]’s leading luxury resorts with golf course included. That scheme was shattered after the real estate bubble burst in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it’s not necessarily about the money. “I didn’t buy Humewood as a financial investment,” Mr. Malone said. “It’s an act of love rather than financial acumen.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Malone, who has tracked his heritage back to an ancestor who arrived in Pennsylvania from Ireland in the 1830s, is among an increasing number of Americans with deep pockets returning to their Irish roots to buy castles and manor houses at distressed prices — with cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the properties are changing hands for about a third of 2007 levels, thanks to the country’s exodus of property developers, many of which failed when the market collapsed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The wide-eyed developers, along with Ireland-based business executives, were once the main buyers of Irish stately homes, according to Harriet Grant, head of country house and estate sales at the broker Savills Ireland in Dublin. “It’s been really interesting because we didn’t really have American buyers in our market for many years,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the attraction of the Emerald Isle’s much lower prices and a slowly strengthening economy has changed that. Overseas buyers accounted for nine of the top 10 sales of Irish country mansions last year — several of them Americans, according to the Dublin-based estate agency, <span class="companylink">Sherry FitzGerald Group</span>. In 2013, this trend has continued “with Americans leading the way, although there is emerging interest from Asia and in particular China and Japan,” said David Ashmore, director at <span class="companylink">Sherry FitzGerald</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, Charles Noell, founder of the Baltimore-based private equity[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/p/private_equity/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] firm JMI Equity, bought Ardbraccan, an 18th-century mansion set on 120 acres of land with formal gardens outside the town of Navan in County Meath. Mr. Noell paid nearly 4.9 million euros, or $6.3 million, according to Savills, the firm that handled the sale. It was originally listed in 2008 at triple that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James E. Thompson, an American who is a permanent resident of Hong Kong and founder of the <span class="companylink">Crown Worldwide Group</span>, went to Ireland last year to explore his roots and was smitten. He bought Woodhouse, a country home with about 400 acres outside Stradbally in County Waterford, reportedly for under 6.5 million euros. Savills Ireland was also the agent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, many wealthy American buyers have discreetly managed to remain anonymous in a number of cash purchases during the last 12 months, said Ronan McMahon, a global real estate expert who reports on real estate trends for International Living, a magazine[http://www.internationallivingmagazine.com/] and Web site specializing in living abroad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, Ravenswood, the former home of the 1970s pop singer-songwriter Gilbert O’Sullivan, a 6,500-square-foot Georgian mansion outside Bunclody, County Wexford, was sold last year through Colliers International for 1.3 million euros, down from an asking price in 2009 of 2.5 million euros. A Texas-based lawyer reportedly bought it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is it time to buy your Irish castle? To be honest, there’s not a lot of competition. High earners in Ireland, who might have been in the market a decade ago, no longer are because of the dearth of bank financing. So the potential market is a very small number of cash buyers, Ms. Grant said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there is not a huge number of high-end estates in good condition on the market in Ireland, Ms. Grant said. That is not all that surprising given that this is a very small country. The Republic of Ireland is roughly the size of West Virginia. “You might in one year have 10 available,” she added “But after four or five years of absolute stagnancy in the market, prices have come down to a level deemed to be good value; the economy is steadying, and suddenly you have international buyers taking note of Ireland.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For nearly a year, sales have been increasing. “A number of prime estates were brought on to the market priced to sell,” said Ms. Grant. Some of them had already gone into receivership. Others were driven by pressures to repay bank loans. And, of course, there were private sales from owners financially hit by the collapsed economy or simply wanting to downsize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Historic house prices are all over the map and, as with all real estate, location matters. There’s a big gap between the cost of a manor house on the edge of Dublin, or one in County Cork overlooking the coast, and a manor house in the rural midlands of County Offaly, Ms. Grant said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An off-the-beaten-path location far from either Shannon Airport, in County Clare, or Dublin Airport can certainly temper value and potential price appreciation. It’s also tricky to compare one property with another to get a sense of comparable market costs. There are so many variables, from the condition of the home itself to proximity to major roads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Knowing how much wiggle room there is on price is crucial. “You can play some serious hardball on pricing, if you’re buying from a bank actively trying to clear up a mess,” said Mr. McMahon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He advises making lowball offers. If the asking price seems reasonable, offer 20 percent less as a starting point. “There’s only one way to find out what the seller’s bottom line is.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even those properties priced at fire-sale prices aren’t really cheap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I’ve seen castles and historic homes sell at auction for very small amounts, but they’re still a high-end purchase,” said Mr. McMahon. “That’s because if you’re buying a very low sticker-price castle, it’s probably rundown. Those charming old stone walls can be quite damp and drafty, not only in winter, but during a rainy Irish summer, too.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maintaining crumbling Irish veneers can be off-putting. Historic homes often come with legal obligations. If the home is categorized as protected or of "national importance" you have to maintain it and keep it from falling into disrepair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The Irish-Americans who come to view castles for purchase have a lovely two or three days looking in the country and traveling in Ireland, but then the situation hits them,” said Roseanne De Vere Hunt, head of residential and country properties at Ganly Walters in Dublin. “These historic properties require a lot of renovation work and constant maintenance.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many buyers, it’s worth it at these bargain prices. Country houses that would have sold for 3 or 4 million euros at the market peak are available at a million or less now and selling, said Jim Clery, a partner with KPMG Ireland and head of its real estate department. “Buyers know upfront that they have to factor in the running costs of these places in terms of repairs and gardens and all that. And they’re shopping for proximity to good roads and a good village.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are other nominal costs that come with buying a home in Ireland. The government levies a stamp duty, or tax, on the purchase of all residential property. For properties valued up to 1 million euros, the rate is 1 percent of the full value. For properties valued over 1 million euros, the rate of 1 percent applies to the first 1 million euros, and a rate of 2 percent applies to the balance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The actual buying process is pretty straightforward. In Ireland, as in the United States, real estate agents earn their money by charging the seller a commission, not the buyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all buyers, it’s wise to hire an inspector to check if the property has any physical defects like damp or dry rot. That is because the seller is not required to tell a buyer about any potential flaws. It’s buyer beware.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inspection fees range from around $300 to $1,000, though the average is about $500, according to a recent International Living report on Ireland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sellers must, however, provide a Building Energy Rating. This rating will give you an indication of how energy-efficient, or truly drafty, a property is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are also land registry fees, which are based on the value of the property and can range from around $500 to $1,000. Legal fees charged by solicitors are generally 1 percent of the purchase price, and there is the value-added tax[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/v/valueadded_tax/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] on those fees. With property sales falling off in recent years, many law firms now offer fixed-rate fees. But starting in July, buyers have to pay an annual local property tax of 0.18 percent of the market value of any property valued below 1 million euros and 0.25 percent of the market value of a property valued above 1 million euros ($1.29 million).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, when the time comes to sell a residential property, a 33 percent capital gains tax is generally charged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers, too, must be prepared for the challenges of owning a home in another country and, possibly, retiring there one day. That’s another matter entirely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans may be able to become Irish citizens if they, a parent or a grandparent were born in Ireland. (In full disclosure, while I haven’t bought my castle yet, I’ve done this. Two of my grandparents were born in Ireland, so I applied for Irish citizenship and now have an Irish passport and dual citizenship.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without Irish citizenship, Americans must register with the Irish authorities if they are staying longer than three months and get what’s called a “permission to remain.” Once granted, permission is given to stay for a maximum of a year. It’s renewable each year. After five years, a single authorization for the next five is granted, and after 10 years, typically permission to stay permanently is awarded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cost of living in Ireland isn’t cheap, and inhabiting a drafty old castle can run up a monthly budget fast. According to Numbeo, an online database of user-contributed information about the cost of living in cities around the world, consumer prices in Dublin are 11.5 percent higher than in New York City. International Living pegs the overall cost of living in Ireland as 17 percent more expensive than the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> average. For countries that use the euro as currency, only Finland and Luxembourg are more expensive, according to its recent report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the bright side, renovation costs are substantially lower than they were during the time of the Celtic Tiger. That is because there are a lot more contractors who want the work, hence labor is cheaper, said Mr. Clery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prospective buyers could opt to rent a castle to get a feel for a location. The four-bedroom Kilcolgan Castle in County Galway, for example, offers short-term stays. Dating from the 11th century and on the banks of the Dunkellin River overlooking Galway Bay, just outside Galway City on the west coast, the castle comes with gray limestone walls and a three-story turret.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The owner is an American, Karen Geoghegan, who inherited it in 1996 from her father. She runs it as a bed-and-breakfast. She debated selling the property -in 2006 when it might have brought 10 million euros. For sentimental reasons, she waited too long to sell, and the real estate market imploded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another consideration for owning a home on the old sod: Ireland is an English-speaking country in the 17-nation euro zone (Britain does not use the euro), so it might be ideal for Americans who do business in Europe</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like Mr. Malone, the chairman of Liberty Global, perhaps. Although he said he bought Humewood Castle as a family retreat that he and his wife would visit five or six times a year, it was worth noting that <span class="companylink">Liberty Global</span>, based in Denver, completed its acquisition of the British cable company <span class="companylink">Virgin Media</span> in June. The deal added 25 million customers in 12 European countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Maybe we’ll have a few business meetings there,” Mr. Malone said. “It is a stopping-off place on the way to Europe. You almost fly over it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There still could be historic homes under the radar, Ms. Grant said. Properties often change hands quietly and privately. “There are houses in good condition out there for good value, but you have to know what you are looking for and be patient,” she said. “It comes down to timing.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July, the Streetscapes column looked at the claim that the 1870 Stuyvesant was the first New York apartment house, and decided in the affirmative. But no one is on solid ground in declaring a first unless he can also propose a second, and it turns out that runner-up is a lot harder to find than the winner. Whereas the Stuyvesant was built by an old New York family, the likeliest No. 2 is the work of a woman shunned by society.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until someone examines every one of the hundreds of building permits in the 1870s, any opinion is part guesswork. But a strong candidate for the city's second apartment building is Anna Lohman's Osborne, completed in 1876 on the east side of Fifth Avenue from 52nd to 53rd Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the name Madame Restell, Mrs. Lohman was in the abortion business with her husband, Charles, as early as the 1840s, and had done well enough by the 1860s to build a large brownstone mansion on the northeast corner of Fifth and 52nd Street, which she acquired as part of a larger lot. According to her obituary in The New York Times in 1878, she had tried to sell off the adjacent land, including a 75-foot piece of frontage on Fifth Avenue, but no one wanted to live next to her. This was before the arrival in this section of the Vanderbilts, who finished three colossal mansions across the street in 1882.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So in 1875, Mrs. Lohman retained the architects Duggin &amp; Crossman, hitherto specialists in the design of top-end speculative row houses. Staying in character, they designed a top-end apartment house looking just like two side-by-side, over-big brownstones, each 37 1/2 feet wide. Cut them down by a third and they could be ordinary Midtown row houses, except for the single central doorway with elaborate torchiers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a building at the dawn of the apartment age, the Osborne had a very creditable plan. It had a good address, and unlike the 1874 Black, Starr &amp; Frost Building farther down Fifth at 28th Street, no ground-floor stores to dilute its residential claims. Each floor had two nine-room apartments running front to back, yielding about the same amount of space as two floors in a good-size brownstone, discounting the space for the stairway in a row house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The kitchens were at the back, important if you didn't want to entertain your teatime guests with the smell of your dinner. The entertaining spaces, three rooms that could be thrown together en suite, were placed in the universally accepted location facing the street. Each bedroom had a closet, and it was not an afterthought as in other buildings. A single bathroom sufficed for the whole apartment. (Perhaps people in the 19th century didn't have to go as often as we do.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two servants' rooms were 9 by 11 feet -- noticeably larger than many servants' rooms in top buildings now on Park and even Fifth Avenue, typically 6 by 10. The apartments had coat, linen and china closets, and rear stairs for servants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most important, the building had a steam elevator -- two elevators in fact. The front passenger car, attended by a hall boy in livery, ''kept in constant motion from an early hour in the morning until a late hour at night,'' according to an 1880 issue of the journal Carpentry and Building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is the elevator, the lack of which had been noted at the Stuyvesant, that more than anything denotes the genteel quality of the Osborne. But the upper floors were still not considered desirable. Apartments on the second floor were $210 a month; by the fifth floor, they fell to $150. In terms of access, all apartments had not yet been created equal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Times noted that even with these accouterments and its Fifth Avenue location, the Osborne had trouble attracting tenants, and had to reduce rents by 50 percent. The 1880 census seems to show the building half filled, albeit with brokers, merchants and other prosperous citizens who were not picky about their neighbor. An unusual tenant was George Ripley, a reformer and writer who advanced the idea of a socialist utopia, and edited The Dial, in the 1920s an influential literary journal. Even he had several servants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1878 Madame Restell committed suicide by razor in a bathtub, ''a fit ending to an odious career'' in the opinion of The Times, which was indignant that her ''ghastly traffic'' had permitted her to acquire real estate worth $750,000. Relatives continued the operation of the Osborne, but in 1883 they converted the Restell house and the Osborne into the Langham Hotel, for transients. The Osborne name was soon taken by the apartment house at Seventh Avenue and 57th Street, apparently unrelated, and the hotel was demolished around 1900.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1870 The Times had written, ''There is no other city in Christendom to which the proper and complete solution of this apartment-house problem is so important as to New York,'' essentially predicting New York's future as an apartment city. And almost immediately after the Osborne was built, the elevator became the sine qua non of elite apartment living. Madame Restell's reputation remains that of one who profited by a ''ghastly trade,'' her pioneering effort in architecture almost entirely forgotten.</p>

</div><div class="author">By JULIA WERDIGIER   </div><div>872 words</div><div>11 October 2013</div><div>NYTimes.com Feed</div><div>NYTFEED</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013. The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON — Britain’s central bank on Thursday decided to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged at a record low amid more evidence that the country’s economic recovery was gaining speed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Bank of England</span> voted, as expected, to leave its interest rate at 0.5 percent and to hold its program of economic stimulus at 375 billion pounds, or nearly $600 billion. Britain’s economic recovery has been gaining momentum as consumer confidence returned and disposable incomes improved over recent months. A surprise drop in industrial production in August signaled on Wednesday that some headwinds to the recovery persist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent positive economic data raised some questions about whether Mark J. Carney, who took over as Bank of England governor in July, would stick to the plan he announced in August. To eliminate uncertainty among households and investors when interest rates would rise again, Mr. Carney said then that the rates would remain unchanged at least until unemployment declines to 7 percent from the current 7.7 percent. Some investors said the positive data put pressure on Mr. Carney to raise interest rates earlier, but Mr. Carney has resisted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, some economists say, Mr. Carney’s focus is shifting to his responsibility for maintaining stability in Britain’s financial system. At the top of his list are possible responses to the ongoing debt-ceiling and budget deadlock in the United States and Britain’s Help to Buy plan, a government program to make mortgages more affordable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Short of external shocks, which might include the U.S. debt ceiling, there’s not much that can shift monetary policy at the moment,” David Tinsley, an economist at <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas</span> in London, said. “The only thing that’s a nagging thorn in the side is the housing market.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of Britain’s largest banks are this week to start offering residential mortgages for houses worth up to 600,000 pounds, or $965,000, with a deposit of as little as 5 percent. Under this part of the Help to Buy program, which was brought forward by three months by David Cameron’s government, the government is guaranteeing the banks as much as 15 percent of the value of the home in exchange for a fee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The program has raised concerns among some policy makers, economists and real estate market analysts, who argued that the program threatens to create a housing bubble by inflating house prices and making them less instead of more affordable in the long term. An index tracking house prices already rose to the highest level in more than a decade in September, the <span class="companylink">Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics also warned that the program, which some said was political maneuvering ahead of a 2015 general election, would shift lending risk from banks to the government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Carney has been deflecting such criticism for now, saying he and the <span class="companylink">Bank of England</span> were keeping a close eye on Britain’s housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview with ITV Anglia earlier this month, Mr. Carney said the <span class="companylink">Bank of England</span> has “a range of tools we could potentially use and we need to use them in the context of other programs” should the housing market become a bubble. The tools include an “affordability test, so individuals who are taking out mortgages today will be able to pay it down the road when interest rates eventually rise,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To appease critics, George Osborne, chancellor of the Exchequer, last month asked the <span class="companylink">Bank of England</span> to start reviewing the Help to Buy plan next year instead of in three years to ensure it was not fueling a housing bubble. The first of the annual reviews is due in September next year, just ahead of the next general election scheduled for 2015, and will be a test for the <span class="companylink">Bank of England</span>’s relationship with the government. Britain’s housing prices have repeatedly been a popular election issue in the past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> decided last week to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged at a record low of 0.5 percent. Mario Draghi, the head of the E.C.B., indicated he was ready to take steps if necessary to protect the euro zone from political turmoil in the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors around the world are increasingly worried about Oct. 17, the day the Treasury Department said it would run out of room to borrow more money and may be unable to pay some of its bills. Silvia Merler and Guntram B. Wolff, two analysts at Bruegel, a European economic research group, wrote on Tuesday that the uncertain situation in the United States “might already have negative consequences for Europe” and could push up the euro, making it harder for European companies to compete.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">International Monetary Fund</span> on Tuesday backed away from criticism of Mr. Osborne’s austerity measures. In its World Economic Outlook report, the I.M.F. raised its outlook for economic growth in Britain by about half a percentage point to 1.9 percent for next year. That compares with 2.6 percent growth seen for the United States and 1 percent growth for the euro area.</p>

</div><div class="author">By FERNANDA SANTOS </div><div>1235 words</div><div>10 October 2013</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>14</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHOENIX -- Here, where the housing market endured one of the hardest crashes anywhere during the recession, the rebound has come faster than in most parts of the country, fueled by a vigorous job market, a sturdy rise in home values and an all-around sense that the worst of times is in the distant past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's hard to find a lot of fault with the recovery in Phoenix,'' said Daren Blomquist, vice president at RealtyTrac, a California company that tracks housing sales, reciting a list of positive indicators, like the area's shrinking inventory of foreclosures, its healthy population growth and the steady decline in the number of homeowners who owe more on their mortgage than their property is worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But those changes have brought a whole new set of challenges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers, discouraged by the high price of land and a shortage of construction workers, who left for greener pastures during the crash, are reluctant to build starter homes, the type most in demand. Prospective sellers are waiting to see if surging values will keep on climbing before they list their properties. Meantime, prospective buyers, including many newcomers drawn by new jobs in the state, are having a hard time finding a place to live.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jennifer Beveridge, a real estate agent helping families relocating to the area for jobs at the new regional headquarters that the insurance company State Farm is building in Tempe, said that the first question she asked clients these days was not how much they were willing to pay, but how far they were willing to commute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are still some good homes for good prices out there, but they're all far away,'' Ms. Beveridge said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phoenix was one of the first cities to fall to its knees when the housing bubble burst. But it has fared better than other metropolitan areas hit hard by the crash, like Las Vegas and Miami, in part because Arizona's relatively simple foreclosure process allowed it to shed the glut of foreclosed homes faster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September, Miami posted the nation's third-highest rate of foreclosure, one of five cities in Florida to make it to the top-10 list that month. Las Vegas came in first, according to statistics by RealtyTrac.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phoenix came in at 92.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics projected that Arizona's rate of job growth would be the nation's fastest, at 3 percent annually over the next five years. That would be a stunning change of fortune for a state that logged one of the nation's most acute rates of job losses during the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gov. Jan Brewer, who has seized upon every piece of good news on the economy to bolster her claim as shepherd of the state's turnaround, issued a celebratory statement, saying the distinction ''validates the work we have done to make the Arizona comeback a reality.'' (On Oct. 2, she was in Flagstaff, in northern Arizona, touring a medical-technology maker to promote the importance of manufacturing in the state.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The changes are evident in many corners, from outer-ring communities like Gilbert, where high-end subdivisions are going up at a fast clip, to this city's core, where buildings abandoned as skeletons during the crash are nearing completion -- some by new developers, others after a complete reinvention. Last year, on the edge of the upscale Biltmore neighborhood, Jonathan M. Larmore took a steel-and-concrete frame he built for 40 luxury condos in 2008, and began turning it into 110 assisted-living apartments, whose first occupants are to move in before Thanksgiving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the recession hit, ''we had just been looking for solutions,'' Mr. Larmore, president of Arciterra, a real estate development firm, said one morning from the building's employees' locker room, still coated in paint dust. ''We wanted for the project to be finished, and it finally will be.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While developers are wary about getting back to building starter homes -- if land cost is too high and construction workers are commanding premium salaries, there are no guarantees for a significant return on their investment, they reason -- the luxury market is roaring back, as banks are eager to lend to buyers with unblemished credit and a lot of money for a down payment. One factor is interest rates on mortgages for expensive homes, known as jumbo loans, which recently dipped below those on smaller mortgages, a very rare occurrence, analysts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(Loans for starter homes remain difficult to come by and the federal government shutdown has not made it any easier. For example, with agencies like the <span class="companylink">Social Security Administration</span> and <span class="companylink">Internal Revenue Service</span> closed, banks are unable to verify the income and Social Security numbers reported by prospective buyers.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In metro Phoenix, the market share of luxury homes, or those priced in the millions of dollars, rose to 21 percent from 15 percent in the year ending in August, according to an analysis by Mike Orr, director of the Center for Real Estate Theory and Practice at the W. P. Carey School of Business at <span class="companylink">Arizona State University</span>. Meantime, the market share for the lowest-priced homes, or those priced under $150,000, fell to 14 percent from 25 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Russ Lyon Sotheby's International Realty, one of the state's leading sellers of luxury properties, this year's sales surpassed $1 billion in May and $2 billion in August, volume that was 20 percent higher than either of the same periods in the past five years, said Todd Gillenwater, the company's chief executive officer. ''We continue to trend at the same pace,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anthony Salcito, a luxury-home developer in Scottsdale, said he went through the recession building one or two houses a year to sell for between $2 million and $3 million. He is currently working on five homes in that price range, ''right back where we were before the crash,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is midpriced homes, though, whose prices range from $150,000 to $500,000, that are carrying much of the gains in the area's housing market, largely because that is where most of the new construction is focused. Sales in this segment accounted for 66 percent of the money spent in residential real estate here in August, up from 60 percent a year earlier, Professor Orr said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He cautioned, however, that improvements can only continue if jobs keep on opening in the state, which remains far from recovering all of those it lost during the recession. In construction alone, roughly 87,000 jobs were gone between the industry's peak on August 2006 and last August, based on an analysis of <span class="companylink">Bureau of Labor Statistics</span> numbers by the <span class="companylink">Associated General Contractors of America</span>. The state's construction work force stood at 125,000 that month. ''We lost so many jobs in 2008, 2009,'' Professor Orr said, ''we're nowhere near where we need to go.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the last year, the apartment developer Arnie Gregory has opened 236 units in two early 1900s warehouses in the trendy downtown Minneapolis North Loop neighborhood. All are full and fetching higher-than-expected rents by about 25 cents a square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a 171-unit development opening later this year in the urban Lyn-Lake neighborhood south of downtown may be his last for a while, amid growing unease that apartment construction may outpace demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everything that is being built and delivered is filling just fine,'' said Mr. Gregory, owner of Greco, a real estate development and management firm. ''But there is a lot of product being delivered in the next 12 months. A lot. I'm always worried about being the last one at the trough.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Driven by surging apartment demand and an average vacancy rate of roughly 2.3 percent, more than 7,000 units are being built and 13,600 more have been proposed in the Twin Cities, according to Nicolett Partners Advisors, an appraiser based in Minneapolis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Minneapolis-St. Paul is hardly the only market being overrun by apartment construction as developers and lenders pursue new projects nationwide to sate pent-up demand and what they believe is a generational shift toward more renting and less owning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor is it the only market where the overbuilding alarm is ringing. Developers will start construction on 260,000 units nationwide this year, about 20,000 more units than are typically started during nonrecession years, said Ron Witten, owner of the apartment researcher and consultant Witten Advisors, based in Dallas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is quick to point out that apartment construction starts totaled a depressed 543,000 units over the five years that ended Dec. 31, 2012, a time period that spanned the recession and a sluggish recovery. Still, some signs indicate that investors are looking at the high-flying sector with increasing caution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate investment trusts (REITs) that own apartments generated an average return of 31 percent over each of the three years ending Dec. 31, 2011, about double the performance of the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts</span>. After returning only 7 percent to shareholders in 2012, apartment REITs have generated a negative return of 3.4 percent through three quarters this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the commercial real estate research firm Reis, based in New York, said the average apartment vacancy rate nationwide fell 10 basis points in the third quarter to 4.2 percent, it also noted that the weak economic recovery and job market were hampering robust rent growth. The effective rental rate grew 1 percent in the third quarter, Reis said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In particular, rent growth is flagging in the Washington area, where some 35,700 units are under construction. Home Properties, a REIT based in Rochester, may delay the start of a project in Tysons Corner, Va., planned for next year as part of a broader development moratorium it has instituted, according to comments made by its executives during their quarterly earnings call this summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wariness about more development is decidedly absent among most developers in many other markets, however. Construction continues at a hasty pace in high-growth areas like Austin, Tex., Dallas, Seattle and Denver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Denver, for example, where the average vacancy rate is around 3.8 percent, 12,700 units are under construction and 19,200 more units are in various planning stages, according to Eric Karnes, director of market research for appraiser <span class="companylink">James Real Estate</span> Services. He hasn't noticed any developers shying away yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My concern is that there are a lot of people tracking demand,'' Mr. Karnes said, ''but not so many tracking supply.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Abundant financing by willing commercial real estate lenders is but one driver behind the construction boom. Not only are lenders eager to finance a fundamentally sound property, but <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> also have kept the sector awash in liquidity, said Clay Sublett, a senior vice president in <span class="companylink">KeyBank Real Estate</span> Capital's Kansas City office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government-sponsored entities, which have been in conservatorship since 2008, provide acquisition financing for existing assets and permanent financing to replace construction loans. <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> financed $20.4 billion in multifamily loans through the end of August, a year-over-year increase of $500 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The continuing supply of financing dollars provided by Fannie and Freddie has created strong liquidity in the marketplace for apartment buyers and developers,'' Mr. Sublett said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Multifamily experts reiterate that the latest construction wave follows years of scant building. And thus far, the absorption of new apartment inventory has been better than anticipated, Mr. Witten acknowledged. He largely credits a confluence of demand, the ''Millennial generation'' hitting the prime renter ages of 20 to 34, empty nesters looking to simplify their lives, and strict mortgage underwriting and rising interest rates that have helped fuel a preference for renting over owning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers built apartments at about the same clip in the 1990s, he noted for comparison, and they did it without the strong demographics present today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have a more important source of demand now than we did then, and it's still challenging to qualify for a home loan,'' Mr. Witten said. ''So that suggests that maybe we should be building more apartments than we are -- certainly the market has been able to absorb what has been delivered.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Observers also suggest that market dynamics could help temper construction. While <span class="companylink">KeyBank</span> remains bullish on apartments, it is beginning to look for other lending opportunities amid some overbuilding concerns in various markets, Mr. Sublett said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Likewise, equity isn't as plentiful as it was a few months ago, Mr. Witten said, because sponsors are shifting their focus away from apartments as other property segments recover. Developers also are grappling with rising construction costs largely associated with a shortage of labor, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apartment developers moving forward, however, ultimately could realize that young renter demand is shallower than they anticipated. The Pew Research Center recently said that 36 percent of 18- to 31-year-olds lived with their parents in 2012, according to its analysis of Census Bureau data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some developers like Kelly Doran have discovered another source of demand. The founder of the Doran Companies, based in Bloomington, Minn., opened a 180-unit Mill &amp; Main luxury apartment project in June near downtown Minneapolis on the Mississippi River, and it is already 95 percent leased.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of baby boomers who rented larger apartments early in the lease-up period pleasantly surprised Mr. Doran. So now he's building a greater percentage of more expansive two- and three-bedroom apartments in the project's 158-unit second phase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Empty nesters don't want to own anymore, don't want to deal with repairs and don't want to deal with financing or condo boards; they just want to pay the rent,'' he said. ''So it's not about price, it's about a lifestyle decision.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THERE was a time, long before <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> and cement mixers, when people had to build their homes from nearby materials. Centuries ago, the Indians of the Southwest used a mix of sand, clay, straw and water to make adobe homes. The Chinese constructed houses out of bamboo, and the English used a combination of straw and moist earth known as cob.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The old ways never died out entirely, but they fell into disuse as new manufacturing techniques led to houses made with two-by-fours, concrete and steel. Now a form of construction known as ''natural building'' has attracted followers, as people realize that some housing traditions may be worth reprising -- in large part because of the energy savings they can yield.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes built with natural materials like straw, sand, earth and rock conserve energy in two ways: Using them cuts down on the pollution that results from producing and transporting manufactured materials, and once the homes are built they can significantly reduce energy costs and consumption.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are drawbacks: labor costs can be high and concerns raised by city officials and inspectors have the potential to hinder construction. But two processes -- using straw bales and rammed earth, a material similar to adobe -- are making inroads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Catherine Wanek, co-author of ''The Art of Natural Building: Design, Construction, Resources'' and a straw bale proponent, said that even though most naturally built homes have electricity and other modern comforts, they can still be designed ''to capture the winter sun when we need it and keep out the summer sun when we don't want it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Straw has been mixed with earth to build houses since the beginning of human habitation, she said, and in the 19th century the invention of the baling machine vastly sped up construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using straw bales in modern homes is inexpensive because it is a byproduct of grain crops like wheat, rye, oats, barley and rice. The straw must be fully encased in plaster, often made of lime or clay, to protect it from insects, rodents, wind, fire and especially moisture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once the house is built, the hollowness of the individual stalks traps air in tiny pockets, creating natural insulation. ''You can stack those bales like giant bricks to create a super insulating system,'' said Ms. Wanek, who built a straw bale greenhouse to capture solar energy for the 1880s stone lodge she runs in Kingston, N.M.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The insulation efficiency (the so-called R-value) of straw bale walls is about the same as for fiberglass insulation, Ms. Wanek said. The bales' superior energy performance comes from the fact that they are so thick compared with fiberglass-insulated walls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for cost, including labor, building with straw bales can be comparable to a custom-built conventional home, she said. After a straw home is built, and especially with solar energy collection, the energy savings are great, she said. ''Roughly we find that you save approximately two-thirds or more of your heating and cooling energy over conventional construction,'' she said. She estimates that there are between 7,000 and 8,000 straw bale homes in the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard Mandelbaum, 43, and his wife, Gabrielle Kahn, 41, built a straw bale home 10 years ago in a wooded area in Forestburgh, N.Y., in southern New York State. They split their time between Forestburgh and a rental apartment in Brooklyn. Their use of electricity and fuel in the 1,100-square-foot Forestburgh house is low, since they don't use air-conditioning, and a wood stove provides heat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We knew we wanted to build in a more natural and eco-friendly way, not just because you can make it efficient and save money,'' but also because it was better for the environment, Mr. Mandelbaum said. The walls are made of New York rye; the plaster is made of clay and sand from the area; and the roof insulation is from recycled cotton. It cost about $130,000 to build the house; the baled rye, from a local dealer, was a little over $1,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mandelbaum says he enjoys the look and feel of the house, adding that the walls are ''rounded and organic.'' He says the finished product reminds him of adobe, which may be a reason that straw bale is popular in New Mexico.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New Mexico, adobe bricks have never gone out of style. But efforts to expand adobe construction are hampered by the fact that it can crack during an earthquake. So a cousin of adobe, rammed earth, is slowly gaining adherents in the West and elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rammed earth walls are made of subsoils (which lack the organic content of topsoil) on or near the housing site. To meet building codes, a small percentage of cement must be added to the mix. A hand-held pneumatic tool packs a mix of local subsoils into a temporary wooden form to construct the walls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rammed earth has a lower R-value than fiberglass, but it is ''tremendous at storing thermal energy,'' said David Easton, a builder and founder of Rammed Earth Works, based in Napa, Calif. In other words, it takes a long time for the outside temperature to make its way inside. Houses made of rammed earth perform best in climates with a high ''diurnal swing'' -- for example, in New Mexico and California -- so that cooler temperatures at night can keep the house comfortable during the day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The homes can be costly because much of the labor must be done on-site. Mr. Easton, who has built about 300 rammed earth homes, is working on developing smaller blocks of earth that can be transported, which would reduce labor costs considerably, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Rick Torcasso, the chief executive of a marketing company, decided to build a rammed earth home on a mountain in Santa Fe, N.M., the builders used subsoil from the mountain itself as construction material. The 5,500-square-foot house cost $4 million to build.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Torcasso, 59, uses a computer to automatically regulate his home's heating and air-conditioning. Last July, a very hot one, the air-conditioner was on only 8 percent of the time, Mr. Torcasso said. His electricity bill was $22 that month, partly because of credits he receives for using solar energy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Juliet Hsu, a 34-year-old architect, has radiant heat floors but no air-conditioning in the rammed earth house she designed for herself and her husband, Jack Menzel, in Mountain View, Calif. (Mr. Menzel works for <span class="companylink">Google</span>, which is based there.) The 2,200-square-foot house, where they have lived for two years, cost $500,000 to build; the builder, Mr. Easton, is Mr. Menzel's stepfather.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Torcasso and Ms. Hsu said that living in a rammed earth home is aesthetically appealing. The striation created by the layers of soil creates ''beautiful lines,'' Ms. Hsu said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither had more than the usual issues with obtaining permits, but in some cases, ''contractors don't know how to build that way and code officials have to figure out new rules,'' said Larry Speck, an architect based in Austin., Tex., and a professor at the <span class="companylink">University of Texas at Austin</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Most inspectors are not familiar with the building processes for rammed earth or straw bale homes and have no idea what the inspection concerns are,'' said Nick Gromicko, founder of the International Association of Certified Home Inspectors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Professor Speck says he hopes that builders and officials will become more knowledgeable, because ''what could be greener than using the material that's sitting right there?'' Not only that, he said, but ''the actual building materials themselves are contributing to the comfort of the people in the house.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Manhattan[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/classifieds/realestate/locations/newyork/newyorkcity/manhattan/?inline=nyt-geo]’s residential sales inventory continued to plunge in the past three months, dropping to its lowest level in 13 years, sales took off in the opposite direction, with buyers determined to make their move before mortgage rates and home prices commence the inevitable tandem escalation experts have predicted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to a report being released on Wednesday by the <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span> brokerage, sales spiked to their highest level since the 2007 heyday that preceded the <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> collapse. The volume of sales increased by 30 percent over last year to 3,837, while inventory was down by nearly 22 percent, and the time listings spent on the market shrank by 54 percent. Bidding wars, popular with everyone except buyers, regained their toehold on negotiations, and sellers were able to reap 98 percent of their final asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think there was a mad rush to complete deals in this quarter before things change,” said Dottie Herman, the chief executive of Douglas Elliman. “It’s a very healthy market. Sure, you’re seeing bidding wars because there’s no inventory, but properties are still trading at a price that has to make sense.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One-bedroom apartments, a sector that is sensitive to interest rates, inspired the most frenetic trading in 15 years, a sign of a shift in focus from a somewhat inflated luxury-driven marketplace (where the entry threshold is now $2.95 million) to a more accessible demographic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan Miller, author of the Elliman report and president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel, said sales were up and inventory was low in the second quarter of the year also, but the third quarter, which ended on Monday, “was like a quarter on steroids: sales surged because the fence sitters rushed to buy before the mortgage rates rose.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Buyers were concerned that prices would rise and they’d miss their chance,” Mr. Miller continued. “So this added a layer of excessive demand on top of the usual organic demand.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the fence sitters now in motion, and with the flurry of transactions completed, Mr. Miller said he expected inventory to stabilize. The supply of new construction, sales of which dropped this year by 55 percent, is also expected to undergo a substantial upswing in 2014 as projects hobbled by the recession come to market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Andrew Heiberger, the chief executive of Town Residential, said that demand would persist in outpacing the supply. “Building permits are up 60 percent from last year, which would indicate an increase in supply is forthcoming,” he said, “but the pent-up demand will dwarf the supply of units coming to market.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elliman reported a significant year-to-date jump in co-op sales of 37 percent, along with a 19 percent increase in condominium sales. The 62 percent market share held by co-ops was the highest in nine years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It was the double-digit quarter,” said James M. Gricar, the president of Halstead Property. “For the three preceding quarters, we knew inventory was down and sales activity was up, but it seems to have come to fruition: we had this highly energized atmosphere with a bunch of super-motivated buyers and a contingent of sellers in the driver’s seat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The statistic that is mind-boggling to me is that we sold 16 percent more apartments than at this same time last year despite having 25 percent fewer to sell.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gricar said the short time that properties spent on the market — his brokerage clocked it at 77 days — was another surprise: “Seventy-seven days, it’s an eye blink.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The brokerage also noted a 75 percent jump in sales above $10 million in the quarter. “It gave quite a boost to our average sale price,” said Diane Ramirez, the chief executive of Halstead, which reported an average sale price of $1.45 million, along with a 19 percent increase in condo sales, up 8 percent from last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pam Liebman, the president of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, said fairly priced listings at all levels moved quickly. “If it’s good, it’s gone; nothing lingers,” she said. “It’s the most fast-paced market I’ve ever seen.” She also emphasized the quantity of deals struck on properties that traded for $1 million or less. “Everybody thinks Manhattan is so expensive,” she said, “but 37 percent of sales were between $500,000 and $1 million, and 19 percent were below $500,000.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Liebman said she did not expect resale inventory to replenish itself anytime soon, particularly on the Upper West Side. “We’ll be dealing with an inventory shortage for some time to come, and that’s going to put an increasing pressure on prices,” she said. In other words, any adjustment will be upward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This is a market in recovery,” said Sofia Song, head of research and communications for Streeteasy. “It’s not a recovered market. When we still need federal supports keeping mortgage rates artificially low, we’re not out of the woods yet.”</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Austin, Tex., Stands Out in Hotel Recovery That Has Hugged Coasts</span>
</div><div class="author">By KRISTINA SHEVORY </div><div>1318 words</div><div>2 October 2013</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AUSTIN, Tex. -- Skittish developers have delayed new hotels across much of the country until the economy returns to health, and financing does, too. But in Austin, developers aren't that wary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A $300 million JW Marriott hotel, the biggest JW Marriott in the country and the city's biggest hotel at 1.2 million square feet, is under construction on a full block near the Capitol. Developers broke ground on a Westin over the summer and a $350 million Fairmont will be going up a few blocks away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eight hotels containing almost 4,000 rooms are scheduled to open across Austin within the next three years, making the Texas capital one of the most active markets in the country for new hotel construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">White Lodging, a private hotel developer and manager responsible for about a third of those rooms, is betting big on Austin. Although the Indiana firm has put up and managed mostly midmarket hotels near the airport or in the Austin suburbs for the last two decades and currently owns or manages 23, White Lodging is gambling its two new downtown hotels, the JW Marriott and Westin, will be worth its more than $400 million investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're big believers in Austin,'' said Deno Yiankes, president and chief executive of White Lodging's investments and development division in Indianapolis. ''Austin's employment growth is second to none and you can't say that about the coastal markets. This is not a blip; it's one of our strongest markets.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Austin's booming tech industry, from start-ups to offices for Dell, Samsung and Apple; universities; and its location as the world headquarters for Whole Foods help make White Lodging's gamble seem sound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the new hotel construction nationwide, aside from Austin, has been on the coasts and in large cities like New York. Few new hotels are going up elsewhere because construction financing has been tight and developers have been leery to invest. There were 2,744 hotel projects in construction or planning around the country in August, the same as last year, according to STR, a hotel market research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Austin is the anomaly of anomalies. What new construction is in the pipeline is no-frills operations,'' said Scott D. Berman, principal and industry leader, hospitality and leisure, at <span class="companylink">PricewaterhouseCoopers</span> in Miami.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the recession crimped demand and hotel operators' appetite for erecting new buildings, more business and leisure travelers are returning to the road, leading to increased occupancy levels and higher rates. Analysts expect rates to further increase when group travel rebounds. Occupancy climbed to 69.2 percent in August, about two percentage points higher than last year. The average revenue per room rose nearly 7 percent, to $77.59 this year, according to STR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As goes the economy, so goes lodging demand,'' said Art Adler, Americas chief executive of the hotels and hospitality group of <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>, the commercial real estate brokerage firm. ''Because the stock market is doing well, 401(k)'s are perking up and people feel wealthier and they're traveling.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With rising demand and restricted supply, the market bodes well for investors -- if they have the nerve to build on their own. White Lodging in Indianapolis is one such steely investor. The company says it has invested more than $800 million in nine hotels under construction around the country -- the largest development pipeline in its nearly 30-year history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have owners willing to take risks. If you are, you get rewarded for it,'' said Mr. Yiankes of White Lodging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pickup in travel has caught the eyes of real estate investors this year. Through August, domestic hotel sales climbed 51 percent to $13.38 billion over 2012, according to <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>. Although two large portfolio deals increased numbers, the brokerage firm expects sales to finish the year 10 percent higher than last year, at $17.5 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stimulated by low interest rates and investor hunger, hotel prices are also climbing. In the first half of the year, the average selling price per room hit $130,119, a 15 percent increase over the end of 2012, according to Lodging Econometrics, a lodging industry consultancy in Portsmouth, N.H.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the uptick in prices, <span class="companylink">Loews</span> Hotels and Resorts is moving apace to expand beyond its 21-hotel portfolio. The New York hotelier has two hotels under construction, and it has bought three in Los Angeles, Boston and Washington in the last 18 months. By the end of 2015, the company expects to have 30 to 33 hotels open worldwide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We plan to continue to be active in this cycle,'' said Paul Whetsell, the president and chief executive of Loews Hotels and Resorts. ''When you consider supply fundamentals, they look pretty darn good. We have the wind at our back and will continue to acquire and hold.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group</span>, the largest owner of hotel rooms in the country, has been on a buying spree of late. In May, the buyout giant was involved in one of the biggest deals this year when it bought Apple REIT Six, a real estate investment trust with 66 hotels nationwide, for $1.2 billion. <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> was also responsible for one of last year's big hotel deals when it paid $1.9 billion for the Motel 6 chain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initial public offerings, another sign of investor interest, have also emerged this year, with 14 in exploration during the first half of 2013. Last month, <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> filed for a $1.25 billion initial public offering for <span class="companylink">Hilton Worldwide Holdings</span> and in July, it filed for an I.P.O. for <span class="companylink">Extended Stay America</span>. The firm is also investigating a sale or I.P.O. of its La Quinta hotel chain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With no cranes and little capital being allocated, we'll continue to have multiple years of improving fundamentals,'' said A.J. Agarwal, senior managing director of Blackstone Real Estate Partners. ''We were able to buy rooms at discounts. Whenever you can buy an asset at less cost to build, that's a good deal.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Rockpoint Group</span>, a private equity firm in Boston, has also been busy, picking up some of the most expensive hotels in the last year. As it is for many private equity firms, Rockpoint's strategy is to buy hotels, fix what's wrong and sell them. Real estate investment trusts typically hold their assets longer and take fewer risks. Over the last four years, the firm has bought hotels with almost 10,000 rooms for nearly $2 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As investors move in, large hotel operators are selling their properties to focus more on management. Over the last five years, <span class="companylink">Starwood Hotels and Resorts</span>, which has nine brands of hotels, including the St. Regis, Westin and Sheraton, sold 20 hotels for about $1.5 billion to real estate investors. In 2012, Starwood sold more than $500 million in hotels and may sell the same amount this year. The hotelier now operates almost 1,200 hotels, of which about 40 are owned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Owning hotel real estate is a very local, local business,'' said Simon Turner, president of global development at Starwood. ''As a publicly traded company, real estate is not earnings-friendly. It's more volatile than our fee business. We think it's in our shareholders' interest to be asset-light.''</p>
<p>Construction began this summer on a JW Marriott near the Texas Capitol in Austin, one of eight new hotels in the works there.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CLERMONT, N.Y. -- WHEN we went looking in upstate New York for a home for our farm, we feared competition from deep-pocketed developers, a new subdivision or a big-box store. These turned out to be the least of our problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the farms best suited for our vegetables were protected from development by conservation easements, we discovered that we couldn't compete, because conserved farmland is open to all buyers -- millionaires included.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Easements are intended to protect farmland, water, animal habitat, historic sites and scenic views, and so they are successful in keeping farms from becoming malls and subdivisions. But they don't stop Wall Street bankers from turning them into private getaways, with price tags to match.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few bankers farm; long days with little pay lack appeal. A new report by the National Young Farmers Coalition, a group we helped start, reveals that one-quarter of the land trusts that oversee these conservation easements have seen protected land go out of production. Why? A nonfarmer had bought it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, tax incentives in New York encourage nonfarmers to rent their land to farmers, so you would think suitable land would be easy to find.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most landlords, however, offer only short-term leases. They want peace and quiet; they don't want vegetable or livestock operations that bring traffic, workers, noise and fences. But long-term land tenure is essential for vegetable and livestock growers, who need years to build soil fertility, improve pasture and add infrastructure. Only farms that grow low-value animal feed crops like hay, corn or beans are attracted to one-year leases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once well-off city residents who are looking for second homes buy the land, farmer ownership is over. After they've added an air-conditioned home, a heated pool and an asphalt drive, the value increases so much that no working farmer can afford it. The farm, and its capacity to feed a community, is lost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thankfully, there is a solution. The Vermont Land Trust and the State of Massachusetts are keeping farmland in the hands of farmers through stricter conservation easements that limit who can own it, which keeps farms affordable and deters farm sales to nonfarmers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To qualify, the Vermont Land Trust requires that a farmer derive at least half of his or her income from farming, or have a business plan that demonstrates an ability to run a viable farm business. The trust has the option to step in and buy the land at its agricultural value and find a suitable farmer if the seller can't (or won't) find a qualified buyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Landowners in Vermont or Massachusetts selling easements with this affordability option are paid the difference between the market value of the farm and its agricultural value, which is significantly less. That increases the cost of conserving the land over a traditional easement by an average of 10 to 40 percent. But the payoff in fresh, local food, jobs and young farmers in the community is easily worth it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the next 20 years, 70 percent of the nation's farmland will change hands.Farmers do not live forever, and most farm kids do not choose to carry on the family business. An eager generation of young Americans is motivated to farm but, like us, they need land and few will be able to secure it without help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government and states spend hundreds of millions of dollars on farmland conservation each year, which can do much more than protect pastoral views for the wealthy. Those dollars must also be used to shore up rural economies and national food security with productive farms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eighty percent of us live in or near cities. It's critical that farms ring those cities, and that farmers in the ring be protected. The <span class="companylink">United States Department of Agriculture</span> spends money to preserve farms, but matching funds are required, and there aren't enough. In New York State, the Farmland Protection Program hasn't come to the aid of any new farms in five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smart, self-interested cities would be wise to do their part. New York City needs to think about the land beyond the boroughs. The need is well documented: a recent study identified 614 vital unprotected farms in the Hudson Valley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York City invested in the protection of its watershed in the Catskills; it needs to do the same with farmland to assure fresh food. It must come up with the money and leadership to help regional land trusts protect farms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As water resources dwindle in the West, and as transportation and fuel costs climb and research shows that fresh, clean food is the key to a healthy life, isn't it the job of every city and town to secure the land and the farmers necessary to grow the food they need? Locking up land for farmers is the first step.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We started our Hearty Roots Community Farm nine years ago but quickly realized that we needed more stability than we were getting with the 20 acres we had rented in Dutchess County. After a grueling four-year search, a land trust came to our aid: with help from Scenic Hudson, we were able to buy a 70-acre farm in Clermont, a town of 2,000 people, just five miles north of where we'd been renting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This land is protected only by a traditional conservation easement, but because it never made the transition to an estate and the previous landowner felt strongly that it be sold to a farmer, we got lucky. But what happens after us? We want to pass our stewardship of this land on to future farmers. We are now working with the land trust to tighten our easement and make sure that on our land, an American farm family will always have a chance to succeed.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOME prices have been rising rapidly, so much so that there is talk that we are entering another national bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, according to the S.&amp; P./Case-Shiller Composite-10 Home Price Index, which Karl Case of Wellesley College and I developed, home prices in the United States were up 18.4 percent in real, inflation-corrected terms in the 16 months that ended in July. During the housing bubble that preceded the 2008 financial crisis, the largest 16-month increase wasn’t much bigger: 22.7 percent, for the period ended in July 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is it possible that we are lapsing into what I call a bubble mentality — a self-reinforcing cycle of popular belief that prices can only go higher?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some answers arise from a study that Professor Case and I have been conducting since 2003. Under the auspices of the Yale School of Management, we’ve been sending out annual questionnaires to random samples of recent home buyers in four United States cities: Boston, Milwaukee, Los Angeles and San Francisco. Last year, we reported on our project at the Brookings Institution in a paper[http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Projects/BPEA/Fall 2012/2012b_Case.pdf] we wrote with Anne Thompson of McGraw-Hill Construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We updated the survey in May and June. The results suggest that though we are not in a bubble now, there are troubling signs that we may be heading toward one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Out of 2,000 questionnaires sent to home buyers, we received 368 responses. We asked the respondents how much they thought home prices would rise both in the next year and in the longer term — each of the next 10 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The short-term expectations were somewhat high, with respondents saying they anticipated a 5.7 percent increase, on average, in the next year. (That’s close to the implied home price appreciation of 5.6 percent in the home price futures market at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange[http://www.homepricefutures.com/].)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These projections were much higher than those in 2011, when respondents anticipated only a 1.6 percent increase, and somewhat above those of 2012, when the expectation was 4.0 percent. Still, in 2004, just before the peak in home prices, short-term expectations were far loftier, at 8.7 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What’s more, long-term expectations in the current survey remained relatively modest, at 4.2 percent a year for the next 10 years. At that rate, if consumer inflation is modest, at, say, 2 percent a year, real prices would rise only about 2.2 percent annually, and we wouldn’t return to the December 2005 peak in real home prices until 2031.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We also posed this question in the survey: “Do you agree with the following statement: Real estate is the best investment for long-term holders, who can just buy and hold through the ups and downs of the market.” In 2004, some 84.2 percent of respondents agreed. But the percentage has been generally declining ever since, bottoming last year at 66.5 percent. While that level may still seem high, we should remember that these are people who have just bought a home. (The level was up a little in 2013, to 70.4 percent.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here’s another indication that we are not now in bubble territory: Some 10.6 percent of respondents said they bought a home “only to rent out to others.” That proportion has been rising irregularly since 2004, when it was just 2.7 percent. The change likely reflects the recent tilt in demand toward rental housing, which isn’t likely to sustain high prices in scattered suburban housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The questionnaire invited readers to respond in their own words to questions like these:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• “Was there any event or events in the last two years that you think changed the trend in home prices?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">• “What do you think explains recent changes in housing prices in [name of respondent’s city]? What ultimately is behind what is going on?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When we asked these questions near the height of the bubble in 2004, especially in the booming markets like Los Angeles and San Francisco, home buyers tended to use terms that suggested bubble thinking — phrases like “limited land,” “high demand for housing,” “population growth,” “everyone wants to be here” and “buyers willing to pay any asking price.” There was also much talk about low interest rates, and how they might soon rise, even though the 30-year mortgage rate, then at just over 6 percent, was much higher than the current level of about 4.5 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this year’s survey, the answers didn’t suggest a bubble mentality, though the theme of temporarily low interest rates remained. In summary, Americans are still relatively sober about housing. They aren’t showing “irrational exuberance” about home investing to the degree they did in the past, at least not yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But neither are they being completely realistic. In reading the most recent answers, I see no signs that home buyers have learned the lesson I tried to convey in the second edition of my book “Irrational Exuberance” in 2005. That message was that existing-home prices have shown virtually no tendency to trend upward in real, inflation-corrected terms over the last century. While land is limited, it’s only a small component of home value in most places. New construction often brings down the value of older homes, which wear out and go out of fashion, dragging down prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IT’S as if people are applying to housing an idea described by Frederick Lewis Allen in his 1931 book, “Only Yesterday.” Before the stock market collapsed in 1929, he said, people thought that “every crash of the past few years had been followed by a recovery, and that every recovery had ultimately brought prices to a new high point. Two steps up, one step down, two steps up again — that was how the market went.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, people have certainly been right that there will always be steps up and down. Unfortunately, there is no certainty that the ups will outnumber the downs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People who are now inclined to buy a home are most often just thinking that we are gradually recovering from a recession and that this is a good time to buy. The mental framing still seems to be about economic recovery and the likelihood that interest rates will rise. People mostly don’t seem to be prompted by the anticipation of another housing boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That’s the thinking at the moment. But whether these attitudes mutate into a national epidemic of bubble thinking — one big enough to outweigh higher mortgage rates, fiscal austerity in Congress and other factors — remains to be seen.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction Appended</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With inventory hitting new lows, the housing market in New York City has taken a dramatic turn in favor of sellers. Buyers face fewer options and stiffer competition. And that can get homeowners thinking about the value of their increasingly expensive broker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Every time the market tightens up like this we see more people trying to sell their own homes,” said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of Miller Samuel, an appraisal company. Sellers see a real benefit to cutting out a broker, especially if they are confident their home will sell easily. “The impetus is always to save money,” Mr. Miller said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York City, the savings can be substantial. According to the latest <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span> market report, the median sale price of a Manhattan home in the second quarter was $865,000. A seller paying the standard 6 percent commission on an apartment priced at that median would owe nearly $52,000 in brokers’ fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Handling a sale alone has become much easier in recent years with so much information available on the Internet, said Sofia Song, head of research and communications at Streeteasy.com. Its paying subscribers have access to the same data that brokers can use when trying to determine the value of a home. Owners can easily look up “comps” — recent sales of comparable properties — to get a sense of a property’s value. And real estate blogs give readers a daily peek at the temperature of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More sellers seem to be giving it a shot. According to Ms. Song, the number of people selling their own properties in Manhattan and listing them on Streeteasy has increased over the first eight months of the year compared with last year. The biggest jump came in July, with listings up 43 percent over the previous July. Broker listings fell by double digits over the same period, largely because of the drop in total number of properties for sale. For-sale-by-owner listings at nytimes.com, however, fell by 20 percent in the first eight months of the year, compared with the same period last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One owner/seller, Francesco Sarti, has a one-bedroom two-bathroom loft at 420 West 25th Street. When Mr. Sarti, 44, a financial analyst, bought the apartment in 2008, he did most of the research. “I realized that I wanted to experience the same process on the sell side,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sarti used Streeteasy to research comps and settled on a price of $1.64 million. He took his own photos of the apartment. He listed[http://streeteasy.com/nyc/sale/1016984-condo-420-west-25th-street-west-chelsea-new-york] the apartment in March but took some time off from showing it over the summer. (He also lists with nytimes.com.) He has had about eight open houses, each of which drew about a dozen people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the beginning, Mr. Sarti dealt only with buyers who were not represented by a broker, to avoid having to pay that broker 2 to 3 percent of the sales price — the usual cut when two brokers are involved in a deal. But he soon realized he was losing out on too many potential buyers. Now he takes all comers and is willing to pay the commission of the buyer’s broker, in his case as much as $49,000. The only downside has been facing off with aggressive brokers hoping to get the listing for themselves. Two brokers copied his ad and put it up on their own Web pages. Those ads were then picked up by listing aggregators like <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>, and getting them taken down from the different sites was time-consuming. He also has to be available for open houses and to show the home at night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You have to have an interest in doing this,” Mr. Sarti said. “Otherwise you won’t have the motivation to do the open houses and everything else involved.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers, predictably, are not happy about the for-sale-by-owner, or FSBO, trend. Jordan Cooper, a partner of Cooper &amp; Cooper Real Estate, says sellers are taking a big risk. Sure, he said, some owners are capable of selling their own homes, but brokers are professionals who provide a skilled service. “Would you represent yourself in court?” he asked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A good broker could not only help sellers reach the right group of buyers with effective marketing, Mr. Cooper said, but also help them navigate the complexities of getting the highest price through best and final offers. And, most important, a broker could determine what offers are most likely to lead to a closing — landing a mortgage and, in the case of a co-op, board approval.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it comes to co-ops, good brokers know how to put together a strong board package, including what information to highlight, what to have references mention and what not to mention. They can also help coach people for the interview. “What does the average owner know about putting together a board package?” Mr. Cooper asked. “If you choose the wrong buyer, you are out of luck.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sellers often think that they can turn to their lawyers for help, but that is not always the case, said Michael Moshan of the law firm Gold Scollar Moshan. “Attorneys generally don’t participate in vetting buyers and their financials and submitting the perfect board package,” he said. Lawyers for those who sell their own properties do more of what he calls “hand-holding,” but they have a narrow area of expertise. “Finding the right buyer is its own skill,” Mr. Moshan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miller said that he believed that many sellers eventually hire a broker after they realize how much work selling a home entails. Indeed, the data from Streeteasy show that a much higher percentage of FSBO ads were discontinued without a sale than is the case with brokers. In June, 37 percent of FSBO ads expired without a sale, versus 7 percent of broker ads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Laffan, 57, a retired New York City firefighter, tried selling his Red Hook, Brooklyn, town house several ways. When his family decided to move to Georgia, he listed the house for $755,000 with a family friend who was also a broker. He soon found himself locked into a contract for nine months with a buyer who was ultimately unable to complete the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September 2012 he tried selling on his own. In an ad on Craigslist.com, he listed the home for $900,000. He had a number of interested potential buyers, including Orren Azani, a broker at <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman Real Estate</span> who lived nearby. Then Hurricane Sandy hit. Remarkably, Mr. Laffan’s home was not flooded, but many of the businesses that draw buyers to Red Hook were devastated. Mr. Azani was unable to move ahead with the purchase because of flooding in his own home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eventually Mr. Laffan tired of the effort — his wife and sons had already moved to Georgia and he was paying for two homes. “I thought, ‘Let’s try to make this thing go,’&nbsp;” he said. He listed the house with Mr. Azani, who had several offers lined up after the first open house. The property went into contract three weeks after it was listed, selling for $875,000, and Mr. Laffan finally joined his family in their new home in Georgia.</p>

A seller paying the standard 6 percent commission on an apartment priced at that median would owe nearly $52,000 in brokers' fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Handling a sale alone has become much easier in recent years with so much information available on the Internet, said Sophia Song, head of research and communications at Streeteasy.com. Its paying subscribers have access to the same data that brokers can use when trying to determine the value of a home. Owners can easily look up ''comps'' -- recent sales of comparable properties -- to get a sense of a property's value. And real estate blogs give readers a daily peek at the temperature of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More sellers seem to be giving it a shot. According to Ms. Song, the number of people selling their own properties in Manhattan and listing them on Streeteasy has increased over the first eight months of the year compared with last year. The biggest jump came in July, with listings up 43 percent over the previous July. Broker listings fell by double digits over the same period, largely because of the drop in total number of properties for sale. For-sale-by-owner listings at nytimes.com, however, fell by 20 percent in the first eight months of the year, compared with the same period last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One owner/seller, Francesco Sarti, has a one-bedroom two-bathroom loft at 420 West 25th Street. When Mr. Sarti, 44, a financial analyst, bought the apartment in 2008, he did most of the research. ''I realized that I wanted to experience the same process on the sell side,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sarti used Streeteasy to research comps and settled on a price of $1.64 million. He took his own photos of the apartment. He listed the apartment in March but took some time off from showing it over the summer. (He also lists with nytimes.com.) He has had about eight open houses, each of which drew about a dozen people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the beginning, Mr. Sarti dealt only with buyers who were not represented by a broker, to avoid having to pay that broker 2 to 3 percent of the sales price -- the usual cut when two brokers are involved in a deal. But he soon realized he was losing out on too many potential buyers. Now he takes all comers and is willing to pay the commission of the buyer's broker, in his case as much as $49,000. The only downside has been facing off with aggressive brokers hoping to get the listing for themselves. Two brokers copied his ad and put it up on their own Web pages. Those ads were then picked up by listing aggregators like <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>, and getting them taken down from the different sites was time-consuming. He also has to be available for open houses and to show the home at night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You have to have an interest in doing this,'' Mr. Sarti said. ''Otherwise you won't have the motivation to do the open houses and everything else involved.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers, predictably, are not happy about the for-sale-by-owner, or FSBO, trend. Jordan Cooper, a partner of Cooper &amp; Cooper Real Estate, says sellers are taking a big risk. Sure, he said, some owners are capable of selling their own homes, but brokers are professionals who provide a skilled service. ''Would you represent yourself in court?'' he asked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A good broker could not only help sellers reach the right group of buyers with effective marketing, Mr. Cooper said, but also help them navigate the complexities of getting the highest price through best and final offers. And, most important, a broker could determine what offers are most likely to lead to a closing -- landing a mortgage and, in the case of a co-op, board approval.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it comes to co-ops, good brokers know how to put together a strong board package, including what information to highlight, what to have references mention and what not to mention. They can also help coach people for the interview. ''What does the average owner know about putting together a board package?'' Mr. Cooper asked. ''If you choose the wrong buyer, you are out of luck.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sellers often think that they can turn to their lawyers for help, but that is not always the case, said Michael Moshan of the law firm Gold Scollar Moshan. ''Attorneys generally don't participate in vetting buyers and their financials and submitting the perfect board package,'' he said. Lawyers for those who sell their own properties do more of what he calls ''hand-holding,'' but they have a narrow area of expertise. ''Finding the right buyer is its own skill,'' Mr. Moshan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miller said that he believed that many sellers eventually hire a broker after they realize how much work selling a home entails. Indeed, the data from Streeteasy show that a much higher percentage of FSBO ads were discontinued without a sale than is the case with brokers. In June, 37 percent of FSBO ads expired without a sale, versus 7 percent of broker ads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Laffan, 57, a retired New York City firefighter, tried selling his Red Hook, Brooklyn, town house several ways. When his family decided to move to Georgia, he listed the house for $755,000 with a family friend who was also a broker. He soon found himself locked into a contract for nine months with a buyer who was ultimately unable to complete the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September 2012 he tried selling on his own. In an ad on Craigslist.com, he listed the home for $900,000. He had a number of interested potential buyers, including Orren Azani, a broker at <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman Real Estate</span> who lived nearby. Then Hurricane Sandy hit. Remarkably, Mr. Laffan's home was not flooded, but many of the businesses that draw buyers to Red Hook were devastated. Mr. Azani was unable to move ahead with the purchase because of flooding in his own home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eventually Mr. Laffan tired of the effort -- his wife and sons had already moved to Georgia and he was paying for two homes. ''I thought, 'Let's try to make this thing go,' '' he said. He listed the house with Mr. Azani, who had several offers lined up after the first open house. The property went into contract three weeks after it was listed, selling for $875,000, and Mr. Laffan finally joined his family in their new home in Georgia.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOME prices have been rising rapidly, so much so that there is talk that we are entering another national bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, according to the S.&amp; P./Case-Shiller Composite-10 Home Price Index, which Karl Case of <span class="companylink">Wellesley College</span> and I developed, home prices in the United States were up 18.4 percent in real, inflation-corrected terms in the 16 months that ended in July. During the housing bubble that preceded the 2008 financial crisis, the largest 16-month increase wasn't much bigger: 22.7 percent, for the period ended in July 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is it possible that we are lapsing into what I call a bubble mentality -- a self-reinforcing cycle of popular belief that prices can only go higher?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some answers arise from a study that Professor Case and I have been conducting since 2003. Under the auspices of the Yale School of Management, we've been sending out annual questionnaires to random samples of recent home buyers in four United States cities: Boston, Milwaukee, Los Angeles and San Francisco. Last year, we reported on our project at the <span class="companylink">Brookings Institution</span> in a paper we wrote with Anne Thompson of <span class="companylink">McGraw-Hill Construction</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We updated the survey in May and June. The results suggest that though we are not in a bubble now, there are troubling signs that we may be heading toward one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Out of 2,000 questionnaires sent to home buyers, we received 368 responses. We asked the respondents how much they thought home prices would rise both in the next year and in the longer term -- each of the next 10 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The short-term expectations were somewhat high, with respondents saying they anticipated a 5.7 percent increase, on average, in the next year. (That's close to the implied home price appreciation of 5.6 percent in the home price futures market at the <span class="companylink">Chicago Mercantile Exchange</span>.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These projections were much higher than those in 2011, when respondents anticipated only a 1.6 percent increase, and somewhat above those of 2012, when the expectation was 4.0 percent. Still, in 2004, just before the peak in home prices, short-term expectations were far loftier, at 8.7 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's more, long-term expectations in the current survey remained relatively modest, at 4.2 percent a year for the next 10 years. At that rate, if consumer inflation is modest, at, say, 2 percent a year, real prices would rise only about 2.2 percent annually, and we wouldn't return to the December 2005 peak in real home prices until 2031.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We also posed this question in the survey: ''Do you agree with the following statement: Real estate is the best investment for long-term holders, who can just buy and hold through the ups and downs of the market.'' In 2004, some 84.2 percent of respondents agreed. But the percentage has been generally declining ever since, bottoming last year at 66.5 percent. While that level may still seem high, we should remember that these are people who have just bought a home. (The level was up a little in 2013, to 70.4 percent.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's another indication that we are not now in bubble territory: Some 10.6 percent of respondents said they bought a home ''only to rent out to others.'' That proportion has been rising irregularly since 2004, when it was just 2.7 percent. The change likely reflects the recent tilt in demand toward rental housing, which isn't likely to sustain high prices in scattered suburban housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The questionnaire invited readers to respond in their own words to questions like these:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Was there any event or events in the last two years that you think changed the trend in home prices?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What do you think explains recent changes in housing prices in [name of respondent's city]? What ultimately is behind what is going on?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When we asked these questions near the height of the bubble in 2004, especially in the booming markets like Los Angeles and San Francisco, home buyers tended to use terms that suggested bubble thinking -- phrases like ''limited land,'' ''high demand for housing,'' ''population growth,'' ''everyone wants to be here'' and ''buyers willing to pay any asking price.'' There was also much talk about low interest rates, and how they might soon rise, even though the 30-year mortgage rate, then at just over 6 percent, was much higher than the current level of about 4.5 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this year's survey, the answers didn't suggest a bubble mentality, though the theme of temporarily low interest rates remained. In summary, Americans are still relatively sober about housing. They aren't showing ''irrational exuberance'' about home investing to the degree they did in the past, at least not yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But neither are they being completely realistic. In reading the most recent answers, I see no signs that home buyers have learned the lesson I tried to convey in the second edition of my book ''Irrational Exuberance'' in 2005. That message was that existing-home prices have shown virtually no tendency to trend upward in real, inflation-corrected terms over the last century. While land is limited, it's only a small component of home value in most places. New construction often brings down the value of older homes, which wear out and go out of fashion, dragging down prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IT'S as if people are applying to housing an idea described by Frederick Lewis Allen in his 1931 book, ''Only Yesterday.'' Before the stock market collapsed in 1929, he said, people thought that ''every crash of the past few years had been followed by a recovery, and that every recovery had ultimately brought prices to a new high point. Two steps up, one step down, two steps up again -- that was how the market went.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, people have certainly been right that there will always be steps up and down. Unfortunately, there is no certainty that the ups will outnumber the downs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People who are now inclined to buy a home are most often just thinking that we are gradually recovering from a recession and that this is a good time to buy. The mental framing still seems to be about economic recovery and the likelihood that interest rates will rise. People mostly don't seem to be prompted by the anticipation of another housing boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's the thinking at the moment. But whether these attitudes mutate into a national epidemic of bubble thinking -- one big enough to outweigh higher mortgage rates, fiscal austerity in Congress and other factors -- remains to be seen.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON — The job market is showing signs that it may be strengthening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of people seeking unemployment benefits has sunk to its lowest point in six years as fewer companies have laid off employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report from the <span class="companylink">Labor Department</span> on Thursday reinforced recent private surveys showing that service companies added jobs in August at the fastest pace in six months and that more small businesses are stepping up hiring plans than at any time since the recession began in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of this is prompting some economists to forecast greater job gains in September than in recent months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If you put all that together, it suggests that there has been an improvement in job market conditions,” said Paul Ashworth, an economist at Capital Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ashworth predicts that employers will have added 220,000 jobs in September. That would be the biggest gain in nearly seven months and would be a sharp reversal from recent months. Job growth has averaged just 155,000 a month since April, down from 205,000 a month in January through April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unemployment rate dropped to 7.3 percent in August from 7.4 percent in July. The <span class="companylink">Labor Department</span> is to report on September employment on Oct. 4.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, initial applications for unemployment benefits fell 5,000 to a seasonally adjusted 305,000, the department reported. The number of jobless claims reached 294,000 two weeks earlier, but that figure was distorted by computer problems in California and Nevada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Excluding the distorted figure, last week’s 305,000 applications were the fewest since September 2007, in a sign of the rebound from the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said Thursday that the nation’s economy grew at an annual rate of 2.5 percent in the second quarter, confirming its previous estimate of economic growth, which was made last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many analysts contend growth is slowing to a sluggish rate of 2 percent or less in the current quarter. Economists had initially hoped that growth would improve in the second half of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If economists are correct that economic activity slowed in the summer, it would be the third quarter in the last four that growth rates have been 2 percent or less. Growth in the fourth quarter of 2012 nearly stalled at a barely discernible rate of 0.1 percent, then improved slightly to 1.1 percent in the first quarter of 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report released on Thursday showed that fewer Americans signed contracts to buy homes in August, a third straight monthly decline, as higher mortgage rates deterred some potential buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said its seasonally adjusted index for pending home sales declined 1.6 percent to 107.7 last month. The index measures signed contracts. Buyers typically complete sales one to two months later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has been in recovery for the last 18 months, and final home sales reached a six-year high in August, the Realtors’ group said last week.</p>

</div><div class="author">By SHAILA DEWAN  </div><div>1064 words</div><div>26 September 2013</div><div>International New York Times</div><div>INHT</div><div>17</div><div>English</div><div>© 2013 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market, one of the main drivers of the U.S. economic recovery, continues to gain strength despite the drag of rising mortgage rates and other economic headwinds, but some analysts are worried that it may slow in the months ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, though, builders are building, sellers are selling and mortgage lenders are less nervous about extending credit to buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The heady price increases in the first half of the year slowed a bit in July, according to data released on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the face of pent-up demand and emboldened consumers, home values were still heading upward at a healthy pace, rising 12.4 percent from July 2012 to July 2013, according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor’s</span>/Case-Shiller home price index, which tracks sales in 20 cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate index of mortgages backed by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> showed an 8.8 percent gain in prices over the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two national home builders, Lennar and <span class="companylink">KB Home</span>, reported significant revenue growth and profits in the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lennar said its third-quarter earnings rose 39 percent over the third quarter of last year, and KB said its profit had increased sevenfold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘We still have a lot of young people that are going to start moving out and forming households and we’re going to have to find housing for them,’’ said Patrick Newport, the chief United States economist for IHS Global Insight. ‘‘There are shortages of homes just about everywhere.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher home prices help the economy not just by strengthening the construction and real estate industries, but by making homeowners feel wealthier and more likely to spend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the number of Americans who lost the equity in their homes in the housing crash set records, rebounding prices have helped nudge more and more households back above water. According to <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>, 2.5 million households regained equity in their homes in the second quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Newport said the full effects of higher mortgage rates had probably not shown up in the numbers yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rates on 30-year fixed-rate loans increased to 4.4 percent in July from about 3.4 percent in January, according to a survey by <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, and many loans were written at even higher rates this summer. But they remain well below typical rates in recent decades, and mortgage borrowing costs have eased a bit from their recent peak since the Federal Reserve chose last week not to begin decreasing stimulus measures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising rates may not torpedo the housing market recovery, but they have made refinancing much less appealing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of mortgage applications for purchases has climbed 7 percent over the past year, according to the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span>, but refinance requests have fallen 70 percent since early May. As a result, banks have laid off thousands of workers in their mortgage units. <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> laid off 1,000 workers from its mortgage business, it said on Monday, following <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> and <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>, which have both done layoffs in recent months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts offered several reasons for the continuing strength of the housing market: people rushing to buy before prices and interest rates increased further, a gradual relaxation of lending standards, an increase in inventory, a smaller share of foreclosures in the sales stream and large-scale buying by investors looking to put houses on the rental market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some analysts questioned whether fundamental factors like job and wage growth would sustain the market and restore first-time buyers to the market. Others warned of a lurking shadow inventory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘While recent results have been considerably better than those seen earlier in the cycle, and also better than we had anticipated, we have not given up on the argument that a large supply overhang of existing homes (factoring in all those in foreclosure or soon to be) promises to keep pressure on prices for some time,’’ Joshua Shapiro, the chief United States economist for MFR, a consulting firm, wrote in a note to investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once the backlog of demand is absorbed, continued strength will depend heavily on consumer confidence. That is where politics, including a looming battle over federal spending and the debt ceiling, could stall improvement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘The real test will come over the next few months, given the sharp drop in mortgage demand and the potential for a rollover in consumers’ confidence as Congress does its worst,’’ wrote Ian Shepherdson, an economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, the <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span>, a New York-based private research group, reported that Americans’ confidence in the economy fell slightly in September from August, as many became less optimistic about hiring and pay increases over the next six months. The September reading dropped to 79.7, down from 81.8 the previous month, but remained only slightly below June’s reading of 82.1, the highest in five and a half years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Year-over-year prices were up in all 20 cities tracked by Case/Shiller, but the gains varied widely, from 3.5 percent in New York and 3.9 percent in Cleveland on the low end to a frothy 24.8 percent in San Francisco and 27.5 percent in Las Vegas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The month-to-month increase in the Case-Shiller index slowed to 0.6 percent, after gains of 1.7 percent in April, 0.9 percent in May and 0.9 percent in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked if the slowdown in growth were alarming, Robert Shiller, the Yale economist who helped develop the home price index, said no. ‘‘I’m not worried. I think that would be a good thing,’’ he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘I’m worrying more about a bubble — in some cities, it’s looking bubbly now.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Shiller said, even the bubbliest markets were still well below their peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other analysts raised the same point. Prices in San Francisco are still only at 2004 levels, cautioned Steve Blitz, chief economist for ITG Investment Research. ‘‘For those who bought and still hold homes in 2005, ’06 and ’07, they may still be in a negative equity position, depending on the terms of their mortgage,’’ Mr. Blitz wrote. ‘‘Don’t let those double-digit year-over-year percentage gains bias opinion to believe all is all right.’’</p>

</div><div class="author">By HENRY FOUNTAIN </div><div>1153 words</div><div>24 September 2013</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The movement to construct tall buildings largely with wood as an environmentally friendlier alternative to steel and concrete has received a boost from an unusual source -- a leading architectural firm known for its towers of steel and concrete.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill</span>, the Chicago-based firm that has designed a long list of skyscrapers, including the new One World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan, has developed a structural system that uses so-called mass timber -- columns and thick slabs that are laminated from smaller pieces of wood. In a report this year, the firm showed how the system could be used to build a 42-story residential tower that would have a lower carbon footprint than a conventional structure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're tall building engineers,'' said William F. Baker, a partner in the firm. ''We wanted to see what we can do to help on the sustainability side.'' With their system, about 70 percent of the structural material is wood; most of the rest, including the foundation, is concrete.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Benton Johnson, an engineer who worked on the report, said that wooden high-rises could help solve the growing worldwide problem of providing adequate housing to the billions of people who are, or will be, living in cities -- while also addressing climate change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We know that we need to build a lot more buildings,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''And we know that we need to lower CO2.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until now, tall wooden buildings had been championed by a handful of architects and engineers, mostly from smaller firms overseas and in Canada. They welcomed the <span class="companylink">Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill</span> report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm really thrilled that they're involved with it,'' said Michael Green, an architect in Vancouver, British Columbia, who has designed many wooden buildings and, with partners, came up with a different structural system for wooden towers that was detailed in a report last year. ''This is the first new way to build in a hundred years. It's going to take a little time to work through the best way of doing it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few modern tall wooden buildings have been built around the world, and only one, an apartment building that was completed this year in Melbourne, Australia, has reached 10 stories. Mr. Green's design of a 90-foot-high mixed-use building in Prince George, British Columbia, will make it the tallest wooden building in North America when it is completed next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Constructing more and taller towers will require changes in building codes -- most of which limit wood structures to four stories or fewer -- and construction methods. Architects, engineers, contractors and, crucially, developers will have to be convinced that wooden buildings can be safe, attractive and profitable. (They are generally more expensive than conventional towers, although in some areas of construction there can be savings because the slabs can be erected fairly quickly.) Fire protection is a particular concern, but advocates for wooden buildings say mass timber does not ignite easily and forms a layer of char that slows burning. They say wooden towers can meet fire safety standards for steel or concrete buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Production of steel and concrete produces significant amounts of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide, while wood holds the carbon from CO2 removed from the atmosphere through photosynthesis. So using wood in the structural elements can help offset the carbon emissions from the other parts of the construction process and from the operation of the finished building. A timber tower uses a lot of wood. This is not conventional frame construction, in which two by fours and other thin elements are nailed together, but more akin to building with concrete slabs. The tower in the <span class="companylink">Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill</span> study, for example, would contain about 3.9 million board-feet of wood; a typical single-family home contains less than 20,000 board-feet of framing lumber.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The use of so much wood raises the issue of the potential impact on forests if wooden buildings were to become prevalent. Mr. Baker noted that in the United States and Canada, about 60 billion board feet of lumber was harvested each year, and as long as forests were managed, sustainable wooden buildings should not have much of an impact. There are also millions of fir trees in North American forests killed by a widespread beetle infestation that could be used to produce the timber panels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill</span> system uses a type of engineered wood called glued laminated timber, or glulam, for the building columns, and cross-laminated timber slabs for the central core, floors and shear walls, which provide stiffness against wind loads. But the concept calls for concrete beams along the perimeter of each floor and elsewhere to allow for longer spans and thus more flexibility in floor layouts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The case study 42-story building in the report is based on an actual <span class="companylink">Skidmore Owings &amp; Merrill</span> tower, the Dewitt-Chestnut apartments (now called the Plaza on Dewitt) in Chicago, that was built in 1966. That building, made of steel and concrete, had an innovative structural design -- it is basically a tube that acts like a vertical cantilever to resist wind loads -- that was used in later buildings, including the Sears Tower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was a landmark structure of its time,'' Mr. Baker said, and it used materials very efficiently. ''We wanted to benchmark against a building that was very efficient,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Green, in his report, presents a system that could be used to build towers in seismically active areas like Vancouver. Rather than concrete, he uses some steel beams to allow the building to better respond to earthquake forces and handle wind loads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His feasibility study looked at buildings up to 30 stories. ''But we stopped at 30 stories only because at the time that was considered so beyond the comprehension of the public,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Johnson said the next steps for <span class="companylink">Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill</span>, also known as SOM, would be to get other groups involved to work on the details of the concept, including construction methods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andrew Waugh, a British architect whose nine-story apartment building in London, completed in 2009, has become a showpiece of the wooden-tower movement, said both reports would help build momentum for buildings taller than 10 stories. ''It will happen, for sure,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's such an exciting time,'' Mr. Waugh added. ''It feels like the birth of flight -- it's one of those kinds of moments in engineering.''</p>
<p>GRAPHICS: Making a Case for a Timber Tower: Engineers are developing ways to build skyscrapers largely of timber, which would reduce construction-related  carbon dioxide emissions compared with conventional structures of concrete and steel. They designed a timber  tower based on an existing conventional 42-story apartment building, and compared the two.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HONG KONG -- Los Angeles has film studios and the best-known movie industry award ceremonies. Orlando has amusement parks and resort hotels. Now, one of China's richest men wants to copy them with a movie-themed real estate development in his country's most fashionable beach city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wang Jianlin, who is chairman of <span class="companylink">Dalian Wanda Group</span> and reputed to be China's wealthiest investor, announced plans on Sunday for the Qingdao Oriental Movie Metropolis. Costing from $4.9 billion to $8.2 billion, it would encompass film studios, resort hotels, an indoor amusement park, movie theaters with up to 3,000 seats and even a hospital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stars like Nicole Kidman, John Travolta, Leonardo DiCaprio and Zhang Ziyi, among others, showed up on Sunday at a ceremony in Qingdao for the development, which Mr. Wang billed as a sign of China's effort to become the world leader in yet another industry: filmmaking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dalian Wanda purchased <span class="companylink">AMC Entertainment</span> for $2.6 billion in a deal last year that signaled China's biggest splash yet in the American movie market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is estimated that China's film box office revenue will surpass North America's by 2018 and will double it by 2023 -- that is why I believe the future of the world's film industry is in China,'' Mr. Wang said, according to a text of his remarks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dalian Wanda will build a series of movie sound sets, and has reached preliminary agreements with four of the biggest Hollywood movie agent businesses to help negotiate contracts with actors and actresses for the production of 30 foreign movies a year, Mr. Wang said. It is also planning deals with 50 domestic companies for the production of 100 films and television shows a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chinese officials were quick to extol the Qingdao project. ''Whether in terms of investment, scale or grade, Qingdao Oriental Movie Metropolis is an unprecedented project that will create history as it represents the highest level and the future of the development'' of China's film industry, said Li Qiankuan, the chairman of the government-controlled China Film Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wang also announced plans to host an annual film festival in Qingdao every September, starting in 2016. The festival would include an elaborate awards ceremony.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the moviemaking aspects of Sunday's plans appeared to be dwarfed by the real estate project surrounding it. Mr. Wang, who made an estimated $14 billion fortune as a real estate developer, said that he planned to build eight resort hotels, an enormous shopping mall, a 300-berth yacht club, numerous apartment towers, a seaside restaurant row and even a celebrity wax museum -- in addition to 20 movie sound sets and the amusement park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Famed for its gentle coastal climate and located between Beijing and Shanghai, Qingdao has some of the costliest real estate in China. But as it is everywhere in China, all land is owned by the government, and the support of local officials is needed to obtain land at low cost and get permission to build on it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a city where even the smallest plots have set off bidding wars, Mr. Wang's vision seems to have captured the hearts of local leaders. Mr. Wang said that the project would cover 929 acres in a new development on the city's outskirts. The plan calls for constructing 58 million square feet of buildings on the site, the equivalent of 21 and a half Empire State Buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Qingdao's top Communist Party and municipal government officials attended Mr. Wang's ceremony but did not release financial details for the land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until a few years ago, the best way to obtain a large plot of urban land cheaply was to agree to build an auto assembly plant. That has contributed to the development of more than 100 auto companies in China, many producing tiny numbers of cars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the largest automakers in China, like <span class="companylink">Geely Group</span>, tend to have Balkanized manufacturing networks, having set up many small assembly plants on large urban sites in cities scattered all over the country instead of just a few, high-output operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last five years, local governments changed tack at the direction of Beijing and began offering nearly free land either downtown or in inner suburbs to renewable energy companies. That has helped produce a huge surge in the production of solar panels and wind turbines, as China has become by far the largest manufacturer of both.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The movie metropolis plan suggests that China may be shifting direction again, and that projects linked to cultural development and consumer industries may emerge as the next way for developers to obtain land. The country's new prime minister, Li Keqiang, has promised an extensive effort to expand the consumer sector and limit its dependence on investment spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Particularly striking about the plans for the Qingdao complex was the inclusion of the yacht club. The Chinese military has banned almost all private use of yachts along the coastline, preserving a high level of maritime control and supervision that has its roots in decades of periodic confrontations with Taiwan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's wealthy entrepreneurs, virtually all of whom have strong political connections, have been pressing for more freedom to acquire and use yachts, many of which now sit at their berths for parties almost all year or are used for short trips on lakes, rivers and restricted areas of coastline. But Beijing officials have been nervous about allowing many yacht clubs to open, fearing that they could stir a populist outcry over the country's income gap between rich and poor, which government statistics show to be one of the widest in the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forbes magazine lists Mr. Wang as China's richest man, with a fortune of $14 billion. But ranking China's richest people is very difficult. Chinese business executives commonly have extensive relationships with government officials that may give these officials a claim to part of their assets. And many officials own extensive but undisclosed real estate and other investments that is hard to identify and value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wang's project is confirmation of a desire to take his own rags-to-riches story, which resembles a Hollywood tale, and put himself on a global stage. Mr. Wang entered the army at 15, right after middle school. He then became a local government official in Dalian, before borrowing $80,000 in 1988 to start a company that is now the world's largest operator of movie screens, with $48 billion in assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wang gave a subtle hint that others should pay attention to the vast market in China, a country that responded bitterly to films, like Brad Pitt's ''Seven Years in Tibet'' in 1997, that criticized China's record on human rights and ethnic minorities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Those in the world film industry who realize this first and are among the first to cooperate with China,'' he said, ''will be the first to reap the benefits.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHILADELPHIA -- With an estimated 40,000 abandoned houses, lots and commercial buildings, Philadelphia wants to consolidate its inventory of distressed real estate by creating a ''land bank'' to make purchase more attractive to potential buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the City Council votes this fall, as expected, to establish the land bank, Philadelphia will join Syracuse, Macon, Ga., and a number of other cities that have adopted plans like it to encourage buyers who are committed to making improvements, instead of speculators, to acquire tax-delinquent properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are new tools to allow government to acquire tax-delinquent properties without putting them out on the market to the highest bidder,'' said Rick Sauer, executive director of the Philadelphia Association of Community Development Corporations, which is helping to lead the land-bank initiative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To keep property from speculators who might sit on it for years without improving it, he said, the land bank would insist that buyers were current on taxes, had no history of code violations and had the resources to make promised changes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You want to put it into the hands of a responsible property owner who is going to put it back into productive use sooner rather than later,'' Mr. Sauer said. A city ordinance ''would provide a means for the land bank to go in and pull those properties out before they are exposed to the private market.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Philadelphia's neighborhoods, like those of some other older cities, are pockmarked with derelict buildings and overgrown lots that have been abandoned because of foreclosure, unemployment or the decline of manufacturing. The vacant properties cost the city millions of dollars to maintain, and they reduce the tax revenue that could come with occupancy. About 75 percent are privately owned, officials say, and many of those are tax delinquent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Philadelphia's proposed land bank succeeds, its scope will become an example for other cities, like Detroit and New Orleans, that are struggling with large numbers of vacant properties and multiple city agencies that are responsible for them, said Frank Alexander, a professor of real estate law at <span class="companylink">Emory University</span> and an author of many land-bank laws in other cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If Philadelphia moves forward with this, it will be a very good model for Detroit,'' which has an estimated 50,000 to 60,000 vacant properties, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposal would take advantage of a 2012 Pennsylvania law that has already been put into effect elsewhere in the state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Philadelphia, many individuals are deterred from buying tax-delinquent properties by having to deal with a maze of public agencies or with difficulties in finding the private owners. The land bank would take control of vacant, publicly owned properties from four city agencies, leaving the city in a better position to combine them with private real estate that it would acquire to create blocks more likely to attract developers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The land bank would also be able to acquire specific properties that threaten to bring down an otherwise healthy block.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Otherwise, you have a cancer that begins to form, and one vacancy leads to another, and people stop investing in their homes and businesses,'' Mr. Sauer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Advocates for land banks envision a variety of uses for the abandoned properties, including market-rate and affordable housing, commercial development, and open space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other uses could include community gardens or urban farms. For the last 17 years, a project known as Greensgrow has been growing vegetables and making compost on the site of a former galvanizing factory in a low-income area of North Philadelphia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This month, Mary Seton Corboy, a co-founder of Greensgrow, gave a tour of the farm to delegates attending a conference in Philadelphia sponsored by the Center for Community Progress, a national nonprofit organization that works to revitalize abandoned and blighted real estate. She said the land, once designated by the <span class="companylink">Environmental Protection Agency</span> as a Superfund cleanup site, showed how abandoned property could be revived for the benefit of the surrounding low-income community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reducing the number of blighted properties also helps maintain the value of surrounding real estate and saves money on maintenance to prevent further deterioration, land-bank managers say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently, Philadelphia sells 150 to 200 vacant properties per year, said Mr. Sauer, who argued that sales would not significantly increase without a land bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The status quo doesn't work,'' he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON — Sales of existing houses climbed 1.7 percent in August to a six-and-a-half-year high, and factories grew busier in the mid-Atlantic region this month, providing signs that rising borrowing costs are weighing only modestly on the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/national_association_of_realtors/index.html?inline=nyt-org] said on Thursday that existing houses were selling at an annual rate of 5.48 million units, the highest level since early 2007 when a housing bubble was deflating and the economy was sliding toward its deepest recession in decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report surprised analysts who had expected higher interest rates would lead to a decline in resales. Mortgage rates have risen more than a percentage point since the Federal Reserve’s chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, hinted in May that the central bank could begin reducing its economic stimulus soon. On Wednesday, however, the Fed said it would maintain its $85 billion monthly purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Over all, these reports point to a sustained pickup in economic growth momentum,” said Millan Mulraine, an economist at <span class="companylink">TD Securities</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The manufacturing sector also is showing signs of brisk growth. Factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region increased by the most in more than two years in September and firms’ optimism about the future hit a 10-year high, according to a survey conducted by the Philadelphia Federal Reserve[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/f/federal_reserve_system/index.html?inline=nyt-org] Bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Philadelphia Fed</span>’s business activity index jumped to 22.3 in September, easily beating economists’ expectations for a reading of 10.0. Any reading above zero indicates expansion in the region’s manufacturing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In yet another indication the economy is shrugging off higher borrowing costs, an index of leading indicators advanced by a greater-than-expected 0.7 percent in August, compared with a 0.5 percent rise in July, according to the Conference Board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The economy is grinding its way higher,” said Mark L. Lehmann, president of JMP Securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists, however, contend it is just a matter of time before higher mortgage rates hit the housing market harder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The strong levels of existing home sales in July and August are likely a result of home buyers locking in mortgage rates due to uncertainty about the future trajectory of rates,” economists at Nomura Securities said in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report from the Labor Department showed the number of initial claims for state unemployment benefits last week held near its lowest levels since before the last recession began in December 2007. Initial jobless claims for state unemployment benefits increased by 15,000, to a seasonally adjusted 309,000, while the four-week moving average slipped by 7,000, to 314,750.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report from the Commerce Department showed that an increase in American exports narrowed the country’s current-account deficit in the second quarter to its lowest in four years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current-account deficit, a broad measure of the flow of goods, services and money across national borders, dropped to $98.9 billion in the April-to-June period from a revised $104.9 billion in the previous period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second-quarter level was the lowest since 2009. The trade deficit was equivalent to 2.4 percent of national economic output, the smallest ratio since 1998.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Builders began construction of single-family homes at a faster pace in August, and building permits for construction hit a five-year high, pointing to resilience in the housing market recovery in the face of higher mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that construction starts on single-family homes surged 7 percent to an annual rate of 628,000 units last month, the highest level in six months. Single-family homes are by far the largest segment of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Groundbreaking in the volatile apartment and condominium sector tumbled 11.1 percent. That limited the rise in overall housing starts to an 891,000-unit annual rate, much smaller than the 917,000-unit rate economists had expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While higher mortgage rates have slowed home sales, demand for homes, as the rate of household formation rises, is expected to bolster residential construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Home building seems to be holding up decently in the higher mortgage rate environment, probably due to the support of strong underlying fundamentals -- thin inventories and steady household formation,'' Guy Berger, an economist, said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates have risen in recent months in anticipation that the Federal Reserve was ready to reduce its $85 billion monthly purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities, which it has been buying to keep interest rates low and stimulate the economy. The Fed, however, surprised the financial markets on Wednesday by maintaining its bond-buying program and not cutting back. That move could ease mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report, the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span> said applications for home loans rose last week as mortgage rates eased off recent highs. Since early May, rates on 30-year mortgages have risen more than 1 percentage point to about 4.5 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, mortgage rates remain historically low, and economists do not expect the increase to throw the housing recovery off track. Home building is expected to slow a bit this quarter from the second quarter, but still contribute to growth this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though residential construction accounts for only 3.1 percent of the nation's gross domestic product, economists estimate that for every single-family home built, three jobs that last for a year are created.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, building permits for single-family homes rose 3 percent to their highest since May 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A survey on Tuesday showed that confidence among builders of single-family houses remained near an eight-year high in September, with builders upbeat about prospective buyer traffic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We expect to see a more meaningful rebound in construction activity in the coming months,'' said Millan Mulraine, senior economist at <span class="companylink">TD Securities</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits for multifamily homes, however, dropped 15.7 percent last month, pushing down overall permits 3.8 percent to an annual rate of 918,000 units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop in multifamily housing starts and building permits suggested that the higher mortgage rates could be making developers cautious about taking on new projects. Builders have also been complaining about expensive materials and a shortage of labor.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CHICAGO -- After a drought in new construction dating back to the 2008 financial crisis, downtown Chicago is suddenly awash in new hotel projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No fewer than a dozen new hotels representing about 2,700 rooms have recently opened or are under construction, and additional projects seem to be announced on a weekly basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These include four- and five-star properties by international names like Langham and <span class="companylink">Loews</span>, as well as numerous smaller lifestyle hotels by a range of independent operators. The boom, say developers and analysts, is driven by strengthening fundamentals of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adam McGaughy, managing director of the Midwest hotel business of <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>, a large real estate services firm here, said, ''The city exceeded its 2007 occupancy peak of 74.4 percent last year and there's lots of room for average daily rate growth. When that happens, new supply starts to become part of the conversation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chicago is the country's fourth-largest hotel market behind Las Vegas, New York and Orlando, Fla., with a downtown total of about 37,000 rooms. In the past, the industry has depended on the city's lakefront McCormick Place convention complex to spur growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What makes this boom different is that it is being driven largely by smaller lifestyle hotels that appeal to leisure and international travelers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ben Weprin, president of locally based A. J. Capital Partners, who has three such projects under construction, said: ''Conventions are not our primary focus. We aim for a younger demographic that likes to go out to restaurants and bars. We try to create a town square atmosphere in our properties.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to <span class="companylink">TR Mandigo &amp; Company</span>, a hotel consulting firm here, leisure travel now accounts for about 15 percent of the downtown hotel market. That is an increase from 10 percent in the early 2000s, and further increases are anticipated because of an aggressive city marketing program instituted by Mayor Rahm Emanuel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The mayor has made tourism a priority,'' said Donald Welsh, chief executive of Choose Chicago, the city's tourism and convention bureau. Over the last 18 months, he added, the city has opened 10 international tourism offices in countries like China, Japan, Brazil and Britain, and it is also running 30-second television ads promoting Chicago as a vacation destination in cities throughout the Midwest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the new hotels are in areas that, until recently, were not considered tourist zones, the most notable of which is a five-block stretch of Michigan Avenue just south of the Chicago River where four new projects are under way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Rutledge, chief executive of locally based <span class="companylink">Oxford Capital Partners</span> and a leading downtown hotel developer, pointed to the attractive features of the neighborhood that lend themselves to hotels. For one, he said, old classic buildings there can be adapted to intimate hotel spaces. Another asset is its proximity to popular areas, like the Loop business district, Millennium Park, Navy Pier and the North Michigan Avenue shopping district.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rutledge recently paid $53 million for the London Guarantee Building, a lavishly ornamented 1920s-era office building at the northern end of the district, where he plans to build a hotel with more than 400 rooms. He expects to begin construction early next year, and to be finished in fall of 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Weprin of A. J. Capital also has a project in this area, a 250-room hotel carved out of the landmark <span class="companylink">Chicago Athletic Association Building on Michigan Avenue</span> across from Millennium Park. His partner for the project is John Pritzker, founder and director of Geolo Capital, a San Francisco investment firm that specializes in hospitality and entertainment projects. Mr. Pritzker, who grew up in Chicago, is the son of the late Jay Pritzker, founder of the Hyatt hotel chain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Chicago Athletic Association</span> dates from 1893 and was designed by Henry Ives Cobb, a leading 19th-century architect here. The building has a Venetian gothic facade and an extravagant interior of cast iron staircases, vaulted ceilings, elaborate tile floors and 15 working fireplaces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People get an amazed look on their faces when they go into that building,'' Mr. Pritzker said. ''They can't believe something like that still exists.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hotel, which will have 250 rooms and be operated by Geolo Capital's Commune Hotels and Resorts division, will cost $125 million and be finished in late 2014. It has not been named yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Weprin's other notable project is a new $50 million <span class="companylink">Soho House</span> in the west Loop meatpacking district, another emerging neighborhood known primarily for its restaurants and night life. His partners are Nick Jones, founder of the London-based <span class="companylink">Soho House</span>, and Shapack Development of Chicago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hotel, which will open next spring, occupies an old industrial building on Green Street and will have about 40 rooms plus extensive restaurant, bar and spa facilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've been looking for the right site in Chicago for quite a few years,'' said Mr. Jones. The meatpacking district, he added, is ''buzzy and interesting and lots of new things'' are opening there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not that Chicago is turning its back on the convention business or large convention hotels. A new 316-room Langham Hotel on the north bank of the Chicago River and a new 460-room annex to the Hyatt Regency McCormick Place have recently been completed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next up in this category is a <span class="companylink">Loews Hotel</span>, which will occupy the lower floors of a 52-story residential building under construction on the north bank of the Chicago River several blocks from Navy Pier. The developer is the DRW Trading Group of Chicago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hotel to be owned by Leows will consist of about 400 rooms plus 25,000 square feet of meeting space. It will open in 2015. The hotel is costing about $400,000 a room, or about $160 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan Tisch, chairman of Loews, said, ''Chicago continues to be a city that event organizers look to and -- since we typically do about 50 percent group business -- that should benefit us.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One consequence of the subprime mortgage crisis is a far more rigid home appraisal process. Borrowers can complain about lower than expected appraisals -- which may mean they can't borrow enough to meet an agreed-upon sale price, or can't refinance -- but lenders very rarely reconsider.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federally enacted rules have set up regulatory walls between loan originators and appraisers so as to shield them from pressures to inflate home values. Now many banks order appraisals through a third party, typically an appraisal management company, which acts as an intermediary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the past, you could communicate that you were unhappy with the appraisal,'' said Patrick Galway, an appraiser and the manager of the Town &amp; Country Real Estate Westhampton office. ''Today, that kind of communication is severed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One option is available to borrowers: a rebuttal letter to the lender. If such a challenge is to garner any attention at all, it must lay out solid and objective evidence of where the appraiser went wrong. But without a decent knowledge of appraisal guidelines, that can be difficult to do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The most important thing to keep in mind is a challenge has to be based on facts,'' said Robert Morin, the president of the Greystone Valuation Group, in Bedford, N.Y.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Appraisers determine a property's value partly by researching the sales prices of nearby homes. These homes should be of similar size and style, and located roughly within one mile. The sales should have closed within the previous six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Borrowers who question an appraisal should obtain the appraiser's report from their lender and review the comparable sales that were used. ''If they believe they're not good representations of the property,'' Mr. Morin said, ''then they should hook up with a local Realtor to get assistance with getting better sales.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That might mean sales that were pending at the time of the appraisal, but have since closed. If they support a higher value, they might make a difference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The borrower should also consider a host of factors to see if the ''comps'' are truly comparable, said Collin Lord, the owner of Absolute Value Management in Boston. Are they located on busier roads? Are the kitchens and baths more dated than those in the purchase property? (Variables like decks and fireplaces are unimportant.) And most important, are the living areas of similar size -- that is, not more than 25 percent larger or smaller?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In putting together the information for the lender, borrowers should always ''maintain a level of professionalism, and not be accusatory or derogatory,'' Mr. Lord said. ''It's important to be respectful of the procedure.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all likelihood, however, rebutting an appraisal will prove fruitless. Better to be prepared at the beginning of the process with a list of recent sales that are most comparable to the property to be appraised, Mr. Galway said. ''I think you have your best shot and maybe your only shot before the appraiser shows up at the house,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a market like this one where prices are rising, sales that are six months old may not reflect current values, said Heather Harrison, an owner of Platinum Drive Realty in Scarsdale, N.Y. That can be frustrating for buyers, but convincing banks that values have risen can be tough when they're looking backward. Recently, she sold a condo listed for $1.1 million to a buyer who, after some initial hesitation, decided to use cash to make up the difference between the negotiated price (close to list) and the bank's appraisal of $920,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another possibility is to try another bank. Sometimes, Ms. Harrison said, a second appraisal does the trick.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RIVERSIDE, Calif. -- The one-story home that Scott and Summer Gieser just moved into is a far cry from the new two-story, four-bedroom house they owned before the great mortgage collapse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their sprawling house had termites and water damage when they bought it, but they counted themselves lucky. Given what has happened over the last five years, since the demise of the investment bank <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span>, it is a near miracle that the Giesers have a home at all. At times, they did not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple personify the story of this region of desert scrub an hour east of Los Angeles, known as the Inland Empire. It is the tale of a soaring housing market, a hurtling crash and a recovery that has greatly lagged the rest of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In several parts of California, Florida, Arizona and Nevada, real estate markets were built up with infusions of credit from Lehman and other Wall Street firms. The banks financed the construction of sprawling developments of tract homes, purchased the subprime mortgages that homeowners took out when they moved in and packaged them into bonds that were sold to investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Inland Empire was the burning core of this speculative fever because of the availability of cheap land between Los Angeles and San Diego. In no other region of the country did subprime loans account for a bigger proportion of the overall mortgage market, according to a Federal Reserve study.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the time he was 28, Mr. Gieser had become a force as a mortgage broker. He had billboards in downtown Riverside with his grinning face, advertising ''Loans by Scott.'' His own home was financed with an interest-only subprime loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But then, in a devastating feedback loop, real estate prices slowed and banks stopped lending, decimating Lehman's investments and forcing it to declare bankruptcy five years ago on Sunday. That event was a moment of truth not just for the finance industry but also for millions of homeowners across the country. Just a few weeks after the filing in New York, the Giesers decided that they could no longer make their monthly mortgage payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the financial industry -- and large parts of the country -- have largely rebounded since then, there are many communities where the fallout from Lehman's collapse and the financial crisis is still a daily fact of life, and few places more so than the Inland Empire. The local employment market continues to languish and real estate prices are still 40 percent below their precrisis peak, according to <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gieser experienced the collapse from both sides, as a real estate professional who lost his business and a homeowner who lost his house. For a while, he was driving between local parking lots, washing cars for $20 each.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, though, the Giesers are part of the area's nascent recovery as real estate prices begin to recover some of their losses. Mr. Gieser has found clients looking to get back in, and he and his wife recently took advantage of the low prices to buy their new home. But the couple have no illusions about returning to the old ways.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We'll never live that life, even if I make that money again,'' he said. ''I've taken my licks. I got my wounds.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stories like Mr. Gieser's are everywhere. Over the last five years, 220,000 Inland Empire homes have been seized by banks and sold out of foreclosure, according to Lender Processing Services. That is one foreclosure for every four mortgages -- twice the rate for California as a whole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the labor market, three of the biggest sources of economic growth before the crisis -- real estate, government and manufacturing -- have all been in a tailspin. The construction industry has lost 68,000 jobs over the last five years, about the same amount that it gained in the decade before the collapse. Only now is there any sign of the losses reaching a bottom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're in the beginning of the fifth year of the national expansion -- and then we have the Inland Empire,'' said Jerry Nickelsburg, a forecaster in the business school at the University of California, Los Angeles. ''It has not yet found the new engine of growth in the future. It's in that twilight zone between its previous economy and its future economy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The upheaval has dealt a blow to both the economy and the psychology of the area, which used to be viewed as a promised land for many lower-income and immigrant families who could not afford a house with a yard in either Los Angeles or San Diego.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gieser's parents moved here from Los Angeles when he was a child; his mother became a real estate agent late in life. Mr. Gieser wanted to get into real estate almost as soon as he earned his G.E.D. and found work with a small company selling mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the years after he started, banks were willing to offer loans to almost anyone who asked. The proceeds paid for a lavish life for Mr. Gieser and his wife, with weekend trips to San Diego and a Lexus in the driveway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Scott was making so much -- I didn't foresee him ever slowing down,'' said Mrs. Gieser. ''We didn't foresee the market doing what it did.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2007, the easy credit allowed the couple to buy a new two-story stucco home on Silver Dust Trail in Hemet, one of the many small towns where a Lehman-financed company, SunCal, turned empty desert into endless cul-de-sacs of tract homes. The Giesers' home was paid for with a loan from the subprime division of the infamous lender <span class="companylink">Countrywide Financial</span>, which did not require the couple to make a down payment or show proof of their income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signs of trouble began piling up even before the Giesers moved in. And once the collapse hit fully, the idea of a recovery seemed like a mirage. The Giesers went through their savings and tried to modify their mortgage three times. They were eventually forced to move out the day after Christmas in 2009, filing for bankruptcy. In the filing, Mr. Gieser listed his income in the first half of 2009 as $1,400.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in the Inland Empire fell 53 percent from the peak in 2006 to the trough in 2009. When the government-backed lender <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> sold the Giesers' house again in 2010, it went for exactly half of the $320,000 they paid three years earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gieser and his wife first moved back in with his parents, sharing his childhood bedroom with their newborn son. They were kept afloat by Summer Gieser's job doing background employment checks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The turnaround began modestly, when Mr. Gieser found work showing homes that banks had seized -- earning $50 a trip. That allowed the couple to move out of his parent's house into a rental, and for Scott to find a job as an assistant to Doug Shepherd, the owner of the Shepherd Realty Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Shepherd said that Mr. Gieser's past financial difficulties did not put him off. ''A lot of good people got into bad situations,'' Mr. Shepherd said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initially the homes were mostly foreclosure collateral. The buyers were often investors looking for properties they could rent out to the legions of people who had lost their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those forces have helped push prices up 12 percent last year and 15 percent so far this year, <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> figures show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More recently, demand for homes has also come from families like the Giesers, who filed for bankruptcy or lost their homes in the years after the crisis. Mr. Shepherd said that Mr. Gieser had used his own experience to cater to these clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He can look people in the eye and say, 'I understand what you are going through, but there is hope,' '' Mr. Shepherd said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Giesers counted down to the anniversary of their own bankruptcy last December, when they could borrow again. They immediately put in a bid for a home on a leafy street in Riverside that had been built in the 1950s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the deal finally went through in July, the Giesers paid with a fixed 30-year mortgage from the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span>. The night of the closing, they sat in the empty living room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We just stared at each other in disbelief, that we did it,'' Mr. Gieser said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Tabor, 37, a civil engineer, runs an eight-person home-inspection company in Hurricane, West Virginia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other than their owners, most small businesses in the United States have no employees. His is one of the 4.3 million that do have them and that employ fewer than 20 people each. And while these companies collectively produce about 15 percent of the economic output of the United States, their activities are not captured by the official numbers in a timely or detailed way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This measurement shortfall in the small-business sector and a series of other information gaps in the economy may be overcome by what experts say is an emerging data revolution — Big Data, in the current catchphrase. The ever-expanding universe of digital signals of behavior, whether browsing and buying on the Web or cellphone location data, is grist for potential breakthroughs in economic measurement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It could produce more accurate forecasting and more informed policy- making — more science and less guesswork.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘We’re seeing the emergence of new sets of data and knowledge that we’ve never had before,’’ said James Poterba, president of the National Bureau of Economic Research and a professor at the <span class="companylink">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</span>. ‘‘It’s a real opportunity for policy makers.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the small-business case, Mr. Tabor’s company, American Home Inspectors and Engineering Assessments, is one of more than 200,000 that have allowed <span class="companylink">Intuit</span>, the software maker, to gather data on their use of <span class="companylink">Intuit</span>’s online payroll or online accounting products for research on employment and sales trends. The data are stripped of identifying information, and, in asking permission, <span class="companylink">Intuit</span> also emphasizes that it uses the data to improve its products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tabor said he had no qualms about contributing his anonymized data. ‘‘I’m happy they use the data for research and to make their services better,’’ he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Intuit</span> began its research in 2004 on small businesses and has expanded its scope, including many more companies and becoming more fine-grained in its data tracking as it has added products, services and customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Researchers at the <span class="companylink">Bureau of Economic Analysis</span>, the <span class="companylink">U.S. government</span>’s statistical scorekeeper of economic activity, are now experimenting with the <span class="companylink">Intuit</span> data, seeking to tap it to improve the official estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘The promise of new data sources, like <span class="companylink">Intuit</span> and others, is more accurate, more timely and cheaper data for monitoring the economy,’’ said Steve Landefeld, director of the bureau. ‘‘That could be a really big step forward.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">National income accounting emerged in the Great Depression, in an effort to bridge the economic information gap of its day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June 1930, based on scattered reports available to him, President Herbert Hoover declared, ‘‘The Depression is over,’’ when in reality conditions were quickly worsening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main tool for government statistics remains telephone and in-person surveys of households and businesses — surveys that are costly and time- consuming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tracking behavior online can pull in far more data, more quickly, so that governments should be able to see signs of inflation, deflation and employment trends sooner and adjust policy faster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, the <span class="companylink">Intuit</span> monthly employment data, based on online monitoring, is current. That is eight months to a year ahead of the government’s best statistical look at the health of small business, which is culled from quarterly surveys, state unemployment records and tax returns. The monthly <span class="companylink">Intuit</span> survey data have also proved accurate, almost mirroring the government results when they are finally reported, according to Susan Woodward, a consulting economist for <span class="companylink">Intuit</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘Whatever is happening, it is better to know sooner,’’ Ms. Woodward said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet whether more data, collected faster, will improve economic forecasting is uncertain. So far, the results are mixed. An encouraging study, begun in 2009 and repeatedly updated, has used <span class="companylink">Google</span> searches to predict home sales and prices three months into the future. In the study, the higher the frequency of search terms like ‘‘house prices,’’ ‘‘real estate agent’’ and ‘‘mortgage rates,’’ the more likely the national housing market would heat up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results of the study, ‘‘The Future of Prediction,’’ by Lynn Wu, an assistant professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, and Erik Brynjolfsson, a professor at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management, have held up over time. In the most recent version, their model using search data predicted future home sales 24 percent more accurately than the forecasts by experts from the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But another major project using <span class="companylink">Google</span> search terms points to the limits of such techniques: <span class="companylink">Google</span> Flu Trends uses the same methods as Big Data-style economic prediction, although it focuses on public health.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The service monitors flu-related search terms and seeks to predict the incidence of flu, before official statistics based on doctors’ reports to the <span class="companylink">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</span>. In 2009, with the outbreak of H1N1 flu, <span class="companylink">Google</span> Flu Trends was prescient.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet this past flu season, <span class="companylink">Google</span>’s algorithms stumbled. As an article in the science journal Nature noted in February, <span class="companylink">Google</span> Flu Trends estimated that nearly 11 percent of Americans were ill at the January peak — nearly double the 6 percent reported later by the C.D.C. Apparently, the <span class="companylink">Google</span> algorithms were unable to sift out news reports and social media messages warning of a harsh flu season, which sent flu-related searches spiking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Google</span> is tweaking its algorithms accordingly. But experts say the episode underlines why the new technology will most likely supplement official economic statistics rather than replace them for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘The potential is extraordinarily exciting, but I worry that the expectations are way ahead of the likely reality for the next several years,’’ said Mr. Landefeld of the <span class="companylink">Bureau of Economic Analysis</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economics profession is gearing up to exploit new sources of digital data. In a recent paper, ‘‘The Data Revolution and Economic Analysis,’’ two Stanford economists, Liran Einav and Jonathan Levin, concluded that ‘‘there is little doubt, at least in our minds, that over the next decades ‘big data’ will change the landscape of economic policy and economic research.’’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At <span class="companylink">Intuit</span>, the small-business data portray a sector that was ‘‘hurt much more than big business by the recession and its recovery has been far worse,’’ said Ms. Woodward, the economic consultant. Over the last three and a half years, payroll employment for all companies has increased 6.9 percent, while small-business employment has risen far less, just 1.9 percent. Hiring among the small companies, though still sluggish, has inched ahead in the last three months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In West Virginia, Mr. Tabor’s company did better than many, but his story echoes the national trend. He bought his home-inspection business in 2007, when times were good. But later, when the economy slowed, hours would go by without the phone ringing. ‘‘I thought, ‘Oh dear, what have I done,’’’ he recalled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tabor modernized the business, shifting from paper to laptops and smartphones, and expanded into doing valuations for insurance companies and serving as an engineering expert in litigation. Revenue, he said, is up 15 percent this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘We are going to be looking to hire, probably next year,’’ he said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By SHAILA DEWAN  </div><div>1108 words</div><div>8 September 2013</div><div>NYTimes.com Feed</div><div>NYTFEED</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013. The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MINNEAPOLIS — A few months ago, Michael N. Felix’s phone started ringing again after four years of silence. Mr. Felix is a land broker whose business dried up when the housing market crashed. But with home prices now rising faster than anyone expected, builders are again looking for what, in the land trade, is referred to as dirt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already, developers report that the cost of land in the most desirable areas is double what it was two years ago. At least three golf courses in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area are being carved into millions of dollars’ worth of residential lots. The race has even sent builders back to outer suburbs like Otsego, 30 miles from downtown Minneapolis, where bulldozers are laying the groundwork for four-bedroom houses with three-car garages, in subdivisions bordered by cornfields.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Lot buyers and sellers!!!!!!!!” Mr. Felix’s Web site reads. “It is time to get moving again....!”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or past time. The latest land rush is in full swing, as developers realize that they have failed to feed the zoning, permitting and mapping pipeline, which can take months or years to turn raw fields into buildable lots. They are realizing another thing, too: they have been sorely missed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“For the first time, I’ve seen cities want to work to help figure it out, rather than doing us a favor all the time to let us develop,” said Scott Carlston of Hunter Emerson, a development partnership. Hunter Emerson won a victory when the city of Eagan, a suburb of Minneapolis, allowed <span class="companylink">Parkview Golf Club</span> to be converted into a high-end single-family subdivision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hunt for dirt is not limited to the Twin Cities. After builders across the country spent decades feeding acre after acre of raw land into the maw of demand for single-family homes, the housing crash left them with a land surplus so large that lots were selling for pennies on the dollar. At the peak of supply, in 2009, there were enough lots to last almost eight years, according to MetroStudy, a firm that tracks housing data. Now there is less than four year’s worth, and only about a quarter of that is in the more desirable A- or B-rated locations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We have gone from a situation where five years ago everyone was saying, ‘There’s too many lots,’ to today, builders are literally crying on our shoulder saying, ‘There’s not enough lots. We can’t find any,’” said Bradley F. Hunter, the chief economist at MetroStudy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shortage of lots is slowing the housing recovery, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders</span> said last week. In August, 59 percent of builders surveyed said lot supply was low or very low, the association said. Housing is a critical driver for the economy, not just because of the jobs and supplies needed to build homes but also the appliances and furnishings that new occupants buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the peak of the housing boom, builders were finishing more than 1.6 million single-family houses a year. That number plunged to less than half a million during the recession. This year, the industry is on track to complete more than 570,000 homes, still substantially below the level considered necessary to replace aging homes and provide for new households. A return to more normal rates of construction would substantially lift the economy’s anemic growth rate of about 2 percent over the last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Carlston said some cities in the Twin Cities area had adjusted their rules to allow fewer parking spaces or smaller lots. Otsego has lowered some of its development fees and allowed a developer to change an approved plan so that a partly built town house project could be finished with more salable detached homes. Rick Packer, a land development manager for Centra Homes, said some suburbs were relaxing requirements that homes be made of brick or stucco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the Sierra Club, which once placed Minneapolis among the top 10 sprawl-threatened cities, has backed off a bit. An annual bike ride by the local chapter, once known as the “Tour de Sprawl,” has been given a less pejorative name and refocused to include not just threatened green space but what the group considers model development and transportation projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mayor Mike Maguire of Eagan, a co-chairman of the Regional Council of Mayors Housing Initiative, said one reason his city had approved a land use change for the golf course was that so little new housing was built in the last few years. “When there’s no new development, you have stock that’s increasingly out of date and that tends to bring your home values down,” he said. “That was one of the things we were hearing back from Realtors, was they had people who wanted to move to Eagan but couldn’t find the home they wanted.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, Hunter Emerson agreed to pay $8.6 million for the golf course, wagering that the city would approve the land use change. The partnership sold the property to a national home builder for $13.1 million, Mr. Carlston said. The houses will cost from $400,000 to $700,000, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The excess left from the boom — land in various stages of development ranging from untouched to what builders call PVC farms, named for the hard plastic plumbing pipes that, with electrical lines, were virtually all that was on the lots — is quickly being absorbed. Developers have gone from buying foreclosed acreage from banks to buying from farmers, family trusts, manufacturers and even homeowners with outdated homes on single lots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What we’ve seen is the inner ring of the suburbs, all those areas have come back,” said Rod Just of Key Land Homes, a Twin Cities builder. “The outer ring, they’ve taken just a little bit longer because of gas prices, but they’re going to come back.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For builders, there is even a sense of déjà vu. “The new lots that are coming out,” Mr. Just said, “are almost the prices that they were in 2005 when everything crashed.”</p>
<p>In order to help build more houses, Otsego, Minn., like other cities in the Twin Cities area, has relaxed its development fees. | Tim Gruber for The New York Times | A partly finished housing development in Otsego, Minn. | Tim Gruber for The New York Times | The industry is on track to complete more than 570,000 homes this year, still below the replacement level. | Tim Gruber for The New York Times  </p>

</div><div class="author">By ELIZABETH A. HARRIS; Jo Craven McGinty and Kate Taylor contributed reporting. </div><div>1232 words</div><div>3 September 2013</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>19</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 The New York Times Company.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Democratic primary for New York City mayor, a new set of political dirty words has surpassed the usual favorites, like ''lobbyist'' and ''flip-flop,'' that are traditionally used to spritz opponents and adversaries with a film of slime.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These new dirty words are ''real estate,'' ''developers'' and ''condos'' -- printable, and yet filthy with disdain. But, conveniently, they have not stopped any of the major campaigns from accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars from the real estate industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Last time I checked, it wasn't the real estate industry's town, and we were just living in it,'' one candidate, Bill de Blasio, proclaimed at an event in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Let's stop letting the corporations and the developers take everything over,'' another contender, John C. Liu, said before a lectern this spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At ''most big real estate firms,'' Anthony D. Weiner said during an interview last month, ''the mayor is like a job on their organization chart.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet out of about $30 million in individual contributions raised in the mayoral race as of late August, the candidates had collected at least $2.2 million from real estate executives and industry employees, according to an analysis by The New York Times. (These calculations included individuals from all levels of the industry, including high-ranking executives and real estate agents -- anyone who listed occupations in real estate or property. Relatives, however, who often contribute alongside their executive relatives, were not necessarily included.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christine C. Quinn collected at least $716,700 from these individuals, the analysis found, the most of all the Democratic mayoral candidates. Mr. Weiner was close behind, with $643,550. Next came William C. Thompson Jr., with $299,000; Mr. de Blasio with $215,300; and Mr. Liu with $141,800. On the Republican side, Joseph J. Lhota has raised at least $118,500 from the real estate industry. John A. Catsimatidis, who is mostly self-financing, has received $3,000, and George T. McDonald has raised just $1,465 from donors in real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Candidates are using this particular issue as a way of distancing themselves from the Bloomberg administration,'' Costas Panagopoulos, a political scientist at <span class="companylink">Fordham University</span>, said of the Democratic field. ''There is a difference between the kinds of things you have to say and do to win elections, and the kinds of things you have to say and do to attract campaign donations.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the leading Democratic candidates, Mr. de Blasio has invoked the real estate boogeyman with the greatest enthusiasm, in debates, in news releases and at a rally, Hospitals Not Condos, he held two weeks ago, outside the former St. Vincent's Hospital in Greenwich Village. Even the actress Susan Sarandon has jumped into this particular fray on his behalf, in a star-studded campaign advertisement. (She said she wanted a New York ''where hospitals stay hospitals; they don't turn into condos.'')</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. de Blasio, who polls show has recently become the front-runner, has had plenty of company shaking a fist at developers. Mr. Liu and Mr. Weiner have each taken shots at the real estate industry and its influence in the city. Sal F. Albanese, who came in at 1 percent in a recent New York Times/Siena College poll, has announced repeatedly that he would refuse to accept campaign contributions from the real estate industry -- though he admits he has not had much opportunity to tear up any of its checks. (The Times analysis showed he did take in a total of $250 from people who work in small, local real estate agencies, not exactly the gilded halls of power.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even Ms. Quinn and Mr. Thompson -- who have been reluctant to antagonize the real estate industry publicly, though she has said she supported a rent freeze on rent-stabilized apartments -- have tried to lash Mr. de Blasio to this unpopular lead balloon in recent days. Through their campaigns, they have criticized him for holding meetings with real estate lobbyists as he chastised them on the stump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All the way down the ticket, candidates are trying to milk that distaste in a bid to get more votes. A mailer from Deley Gazinelli, for example, a candidate for Democratic district leader in Manhattan, proclaimed in bold lettering, ''I am running against a real estate lawyer who doesn't care about the Village.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some members of the real estate industry may grumble to find themselves on the raw end of a stump speech, said Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, a business group, but most just shrug it off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's political pandering to a public sentiment that the middle class and low-income people have been left out of the prosperity of the past decade,'' Ms. Wylde said. ''I think, for the most part, they would govern with very different interests than their political rhetoric suggests.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so the money rolls in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While many businesses are regulated by federal or state government, real estate interests are largely controlled by New York City, which means the industry tends to be among the biggest campaign donors in its politics. In this election, for example, a political action committee called Jobs for New York, led by the Real Estate Board of New York, pledged to spend up to $10 million on electing a business-friendly City Council, where many land-use issues are decided. In the race for mayor, big players in real estate tend to spread their donations among several likely candidates to cover their bases, Ms. Wylde said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the candidates have been raising money for several years, and some of the donations were made as far back as 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The watchdog group <span class="companylink">Common Cause</span> New York looked at campaign contributions made by top executives and their spouses at some of the city's most powerful real estate companies -- those represented by Officers on the Real Estate Board of New York's Board of Governors, like Extell Development and Rudin Management. The group found that Ms. Quinn had collected the most money from real estate donors in total. Since 2011, however, they found Mr. Thompson had received the highest amount. Mr. de Blasio jumped from fourth place to third in that more recent bracket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultimately, the titans of real estate will not be picking up their skyscrapers and leaving the city no matter who wins the election, or how much they are criticized in stump speeches. And in the meantime, it is voters, most of whom cannot afford a luxurious new apartment, who are listening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a very rational electoral strategy, to appeal to people who are less and less able to live close to where they work, and who frequently have to leave neighborhoods they knew and loved,'' said Kenneth Sherrill, a professor emeritus of political science at Hunter College. Besides, he added, ''How many people do you know who love their landlord?''</p>
<p>Condos are being built on the former site of St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. The site has become  a hot-button issue in the mayoral race. Gary Barnett, far left, of Extell Development and  Jack Rudin, left, of Rudin Management have contributed to candidates running for mayor. (PHOTOGRAPH BY ÁNGEL FRANCO/THE NEW YORK TIMES) </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON — Fewer people signed contracts to buy American homes in July, but the level stayed close to a six-and-a-half-year high. The modest decline suggests that higher mortgage rates have yet to slow sales sharply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors[http://www.realtor.org/news-releases/2013/08/july-pending-home-sales-slip] said its seasonally adjusted index for pending home sales declined 1.3 percent, to 109.5 in July. That is close to May’s reading of 111.3, which was the highest since December 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The small decline suggests that sales of previously owned homes should remain healthy in the coming months. There is generally a one- to two-month lag between a signed contract and a completed sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Final sales jumped to an annual pace of 5.4 million in July, the highest in three and a half years, the group said last week. Such a pace is consistent with a healthy housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher mortgage rates appeared to have had a bigger impact on new-home sales, which plummeted last month. That raised fears that rate increases were restraining the housing recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many economists note that home prices and mortgage rates remain low by historical standards. Consistent job gains and rising consumer confidence may also support sales in the coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Higher mortgage rates are clearly negative for housing, but other key drivers — including the labor market, confidence and expectations for prices and interest rates — still point to improvement,” Jim O’Sullivan, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics, said in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average rate on a 30-year mortgage reached 4.58 percent last week, the highest level in two years and up from 3.35 percent in early May. Still, that is below the average since 1985 of about 7 percent, according to Bankrate.com[http://Bankrate.com].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates began to rise after the Federal Reserve[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/f/federal_reserve_system/index.html?inline=nyt-org] chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, signaled that the Fed might reduce its bond purchases later this year. The purchases have helped keep borrowing costs low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising home prices and more construction have bolstered economic growth and created more jobs. The housing recovery has provided crucial support to the economy when other drivers, like manufacturing, have struggled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gains in home prices may be starting to level off, however. Prices jumped 12.1 percent in June from a year earlier, according to the Standard &amp; Poor’s/Case-Shiller home price index[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/s/standard_poors_caseshiller_home_price_index/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] released on Tuesday. That is slightly slower than May’s 12.2 percent year-over-year gain. But price increases slowed in June from May in 14 of the 20 cities tracked by the index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stabilization in prices is not necessarily a bad thing, economists said, because it could keep homes affordable and help prevent a bubble from developing in the housing market.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON — A pair of reports issued Tuesday offered bright news on the state of the economy, with home prices increasing and consumer confidence rising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices rose 12.1 percent in June compared with a year earlier, nearly matching a seven-year high. However, month-over-month price gains slowed in most markets, a sign that higher mortgage rates may cool the housing recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Standard &amp; Poor’s/Case-Shiller[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/s/standard_poors_caseshiller_home_price_index/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] 20-city home price index slowed only marginally from May’s year-over-year gain of 12.2 percent, the fastest since March 2006. And all 20 cities posted gains from the previous month and compared with a year ago, according to the report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, Americans’ confidence in the economy inched closer to a five-and-a-half-year high on growing optimism that hiring and wages could pick up in coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span>, a private research group based in New York, said Tuesday that its consumer confidence index rose to 81.5 in August. That is up from a revised reading of 81 in July and just below the 82.1 reading in June, which was the highest since January 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the housing report, prices in Las Vegas soared 24.9 percent from a year earlier to lead all cities. Purchases by investors have helped drive that increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other cities hit hard by the housing downturn also posted major gains in the last year. Prices have jumped 24.5 percent in San Francisco and nearly 20 percent in both Los Angeles and Phoenix.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, 14 of the 20 cities posted smaller gains in June compared with May. That is unusual, as June is the middle of the crucial summer buying season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in cities less affected by the housing crisis, gains have been more modest. Prices in New York and Cleveland are about 3 percent higher than a year earlier. Prices rose 5.7 percent in Washington and 6.7 percent in Boston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span> report, consumers’ income expectations, which fell earlier this year after a January payroll tax increase, rebounded to the highest level in two-and-a-half years, said Lynn Franco, director of the board’s economic indicators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although consumers were more confident about the future, their assessment of the current economy dipped slightly in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Consumer sentiment is holding steady, supported by advances in stocks, solid job creation, and a broad-based recovery in the housing market,” Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors, wrote in a note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers’ confidence in the economy is watched closely because their spending accounts for about 70 percent of national economic activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After hitting bottom at 25.3 at the depths of the Great Recession in February 2009, the index has bounced back. But it has yet to get back to the 90 reading that signals a healthy economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans’ confidence jumped in June on hopes that the job market was starting to turn around. The economy has created an average of 192,000 jobs a month this year, slightly ahead of last year’s pace. And the unemployment rate fell last month to a four-and-a-half-year low of 7.4 percent.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The area of lower Broadway south of Canal Street in Manhattan has long been characterized by nondescript discount stores and lunchtime counters packed with city workers. It has been mostly ignored by the wave of gentrification to the west that has flooded TriBeCa over the last decade, bringing with it baby carriages, designer boutiques and restaurants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Along Broadway has always been the funkier part of TriBeCa where you can still find artists,'' said Erik Torkells, the editor of the Tribeca Citizen, a neighborhood Web site. ''People call it Chibeca because of its proximity to Chinatown.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This may be about to change. On a four-block stretch of Broadway, between Worth and Walker Streets, nine new residential projects are in the works, bringing more than 430 new condominium units to the area. The burst in activity is largely because of a booming condominium market and insatiable demand for downtown luxury apartments that is rapidly encroaching on commercial spaces and transforming old office towers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the second quarter this year, the average condominium price in TriBeCa reached $1,583 a square foot, nearly 17 percent higher than the $1,354 a square foot posted last year during the similar period, according to data from the appraisal firm Miller Samuel. The median sales price in the neighborhood was $2.75 million in the second quarter, a significant premium over the $1.25 million for all of Manhattan, according to the firm. Land prices for development sites have followed, averaging as much as $500 a buildable square foot in TriBeCa, up from just $300 a buildable square foot two years ago, brokers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With prices approaching $2,000 a square foot or better in TriBeCa, it is encouraging the expansion of the core of the neighborhood to adjacent areas like Broadway,'' said Daniel Fasulo, a managing director at <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>, a research firm. ''The amount of deal-making in the neighborhood is astounding.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the start of winter, the first buyers will move in to 93 Worth Street, a 92-unit condominium that features a dog-washing station and a roof-deck terrace. The 18-story building has had swift demand from buyers, with just nine apartments remaining, including four penthouses that are yet to be put on the market. The average sale price is $1,700 a square foot, according to Eldad Blaustein, the chief executive of IGI USA, the building's developer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a brand-new Broadway corridor,'' said Doron Zwickel, an associate real estate broker at Core, which is marketing the building. ''Historically, this hasn't been prime TriBeCa, but it is becoming more desirable.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One draw has actually been that the building is outside the core of the neighborhood, and not in the flood zone that saw so much damage during Hurricane Sandy last year. ''After the storm, we got a lot of interest from people close to the water who wanted to be in the neighborhood but didn't want to have the risks,'' Mr. Zwickel said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Leonard Street one block to the south, two buildings are rising: 350 Broadway, a 12-story former office tower, is being converted into a 66-unit condominium. <span class="companylink">Bizzi &amp; Partners Development</span>, which built the Setai Fifth Avenue in Midtown, began sales in July, and the building, called 101 Leonard, is more than 60 percent sold. At 346 Broadway, the Miami-based developer Don Peebles is planning a $350 million renovation to convert the building, which was used by the New York City Criminal Court, into roughly 200 condominium units and a hotel. It acquired the 13-story building in March from the City of New York for $160 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Broadway and Franklin Street, the developer El Ad is planning the Franklin, a 53-unit condo complex with amenities like a children's playroom and a rooftop pool. The building has gone through a number of failed conversion plans, perhaps most notoriously in 2006, when the Dutch architect Ben van Berkel designed a 20-story apartment building, with glass elevators and a facade of black metal bands. Those plans fell apart during the recession, and El Ad eventually acquired the site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Franklin ''is the fastest-selling building I've ever had,'' said Richard Cantor, a principal at the brokerage firm Cantor Pecorella, which is overseeing the marketing. Since sales began in May, 48 of the 53 apartments are in contract. Originally, the units were priced at $1,350 a square foot, but they were later raised to $1,550 and then $1,650. ''Now, by the time we sell out, the prices will be closer to $1,800 a foot; we just sold the largest penthouse for $10 million, or just under $2,700 a foot,'' Mr. Cantor said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are also a number of small boutique buildings in the works. The Keystone Group acquired 391 Broadway, a commercial building, eight months ago and is converting it into four residential floor-through lofts with retail space on the ground floor. ''With TriBeCa the way it is, there is not enough product for all of the demand, so the neighborhood keeps being pushed eastward,'' said Daniel Martin, a managing director at Keystone Group. It hopes to complete the project by May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 372 Broadway, which is being renamed 6 Cortlandt Alley for the street it abuts, developers are getting approvals to build a five-unit condominium, with sales beginning in the spring. At 361 Broadway, the Japanese architect Shigeru Ban is designing 13 condominium units, including a set of glass duplex penthouses that will be affixed atop the six-story cast-iron building. The plans were approved last year, and construction is set to begin as early as next month, said Dean Maltz, the building's executive architect based in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another possible development could come at 360 Broadway, where the real estate investor Waterbridge Capital recently acquired the building for $23 million. Calls to the chief executive, Joel Schreiber, were not returned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've done a number of sales on the SoHo side of Broadway, and it seems to me a very natural progression to develop the area below Canal Street,'' said Susan Wires, a broker at the brokerage firm <span class="companylink">Stribling &amp; Associates</span>, which is marketing 6 Cortlandt Alley with her partner, Leila Yusuf. ''So many of the buildings that are coming to this area are large-scale, but ours will be really intimate and boutique, something that is missing in the marketplace right now.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With such a strong condominium market, the land prices for development sites have also skyrocketed. ''If you compare where prices are today from 2010, it has gone way up,'' said Nick Petkoff, the director of sales at the brokerage firm Massey Knakal Realty Services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Mr. Blaustein acquired 93 Worth Street in 2010, for example, he paid roughly $300 a buildable square foot. ''Now, if you are buying buildings to convert, they are costing $500 to $550 a square foot,'' he said. ''We would love to buy more buildings in the neighborhood, but the competition has become fierce.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The demand for development sites is a key reason that the owners of 396 Broadway have put the vacant building on the market for $37 million, rather then push ahead with plans to convert it into a 50-unit rental building. ''We have approved plans for a residential conversion, and an alternative plan for a hotel,'' said Gene Kaufman, the project's architect. ''But the owners right now see that the property is a lot more valuable than it once was, and so it is reasonable that they pause and rethink it, given that the circumstances have improved for the better.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while there has been many residential developments, retail activity in the neighborhood remains lackluster. ''Retail hasn't happened yet, it is all very embryonic,'' said Roger E. Eulau, an executive managing director at the <span class="companylink">Lansco Corporation</span>, a retail brokerage firm. Rents are around $100 to $150 a square foot, compared with as much as $1,000 a square foot on Broadway in SoHo, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, ''we feel that Broadway is going to be a natural gateway that links the Fulton Street Transit hub and the World Trade Center to SoHo, it is a natural thoroughfare for retail,'' said Mr. Martin of the Keystone Group. ''We are very bullish about this neighborhood's future.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON -- Depending on where one stands in the debate on the rising cost of housing in Britain, Paul Thomas and Abigail Walker, first-time home buyers, are either part of the solution or part of the problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To buy a £248,000, or $386,000, two-bedroom house in Oxfordshire, west of London, Mr. Thomas, a 38-year-old electrician, and his 25-year-old partner, Ms. Walker, who works in an accounting office, are making use of a government program called Help to Buy. Through it, they are able to make a down payment of only 5 percent from their own funds, with the government giving them an interest-free loan to cover the other 20 percent of the deposit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government of Prime Minister David Cameron has cast the program as a way to stimulate the country's sluggish economy by helping consumers -- skeptics might refer to them as voters -- buy homes they could not otherwise afford. But critics say it could lead to a housing bubble and a spate of problem loans on which the government could be left to make good.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under Help to Buy, rolled out in March, the government either offers interest-free credit or guarantees part of the property loan. The resulting higher demand for homes is supposed to fuel construction and aid the economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Help to Buy is a dramatic intervention to get our housing market moving,'' George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, told Parliament in presenting the plan. ''That is a good use of this government's fiscal credibility.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But over the last month, the program has drawn a growing outcry from some lawmakers and economists, demanding an early end for Help to Buy. They note that the housing market has already been picking up and warn that the plan could create a housing bubble that would be likely to burst when the program expires in 2016, while driving price increases that will make homes even less affordable for many in the meantime.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As evidence, they cite a report this month by the government statistical office that indicated that house-price inflation had risen in June at annual rate of 3.1 percent, up from 2.9 percent in May, bringing prices to the highest level in five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Albert Edwards, an outspoken strategist at <span class="companylink">Société Générale</span> in London, called the British plan ''madness'' and ''truly moronic,'' saying that ''buyers need cheaper homes, not greater availability of debt to inflate house prices even further.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics also question the wisdom of enabling people to get a mortgage with a down payment of as little as 5 percent of the home value at a time when lenders are under pressure from regulators to reduce the riskiness of loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also means that Britain is increasing support to the housing sector just as the United States is seeking ways to reduce the government's role and risk in the mortgage market. This month, President Barack Obama proposed winding down <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, the two giant government-backed mortgage finance companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We do not want what the U.S. has, which is a government-guaranteed mortgage market, and they are desperately trying to find a way out of that position,'' Mervyn A. King told Sky News in an interview a month before he retired in July as the Bank of England governor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">International Monetary Fund</span> warned in May that Help to Buy would push up house prices if the government does not ensure that more houses are built. Fitch, the debt ratings agency, has raised similar concerns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan as announced in March by Mr. Osborne came in two parts. The first piece, in place since April, is limited to the purchase of newly built homes. The government offers a five-year interest-free loan worth 20 percent of the home value to help pay the deposit. Mr. Thomas and Ms. Walker are getting help through that portion of the program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second and more controversial part of the plan, which is due to start in January, allows the buyers of any house to pay only 5 percent of the value of the home as a deposit. The government would then guarantee an additional 20 percent of the bank loan for any property worth as much as £600,000, effectively passing the risk from the lender to the government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Using the government's balance sheet to back these higher loan-to-value mortgages will dramatically increase their availability,'' Mr. Osborne said when he presented the plan to Parliament in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Thomas and Ms. Walker had recently moved in with Ms. Walker's mother in Oxfordshire to save money for a deposit, which they said would have taken them 10 years to come up with on their own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now they plan to move into their newly built home in the autumn. Instead of a £62,000 down payment on the £248,000 purchase price, they had to put down only £12,400. Help to Buy is coming up with the rest. ''It really put a smile on my face,'' Mr. Thomas said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists said making voters like Mr. Thomas happy was the main motive for Mr. Osborne's plan. About two years before the next general election, and with recent opinion polls showing the opposition Labour Party neck and neck with Mr. Osborne's Conservative Party, Mr. Osborne is betting on the housing market. Not being able to afford a home is ''a blow to the most human of aspirations,'' he told Parliament.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government says the program has been a success so far. More than 10,000 people have reserved newly built homes since April, and the number of first-time buyers was at the highest level since 2007, the government said this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some property developers are also happy. <span class="companylink">Barratt Developments</span>, one of Britain's largest house builders, said sales had risen 35 percent in the three months through the end of June, from the comparable period last year, with ''a significant amount'' of the upturn a result of Help to Buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, those gains are coming at a time when Britain's housing market had already been improving. Helped by record low interest rates and demand from foreign buyers, especially in London, prices of homes nationwide rose 4.6 percent in the three months to July, the highest annual increase since August 2010, according to the mortgage provider Halifax. In London, the increase was 8.1 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with the United States or some countries in Southern Europe, Britain's housing market downturn after the financial crisis was relatively mild. House prices in Britain fell faster after their peak in 2007 but less steeply than those in the United States because of a combination of mortgage laws and a shortage of new homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House prices have increased so much in London that the average first-time buyer now has to spend half of his net salary on mortgage payments, according to the <span class="companylink">Nationwide Building Society</span>. ''For a market that is already clearly expensive, the government is throwing petrol on an already inflated situation,'' said Mr. Edwards, the <span class="companylink">Société Générale</span> strategist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Osborne and the <span class="companylink">Bank of England</span>'s new governor, Mark J. Carney, have rebutted criticisms of the housing program, saying Britain was still far from a housing bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But behind the scenes at the <span class="companylink">Bank of England's Prudential Regulation Authority</span>, which is charge of ensuring the safety of banks, there are concerns that Help to Buy conflicts with the regulator's aim of reducing risk in the banking sector and applying stricter lending rules, according to a senior bank official, who declined to be identified because the concerns were not public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks that have signed up for the program include <span class="companylink">Lloyds Banking Group</span>, in which the government continues to hold a stake after a bailout, along with <span class="companylink">Nationwide</span> and Santander.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those banks and others are in talks with the government about how much lenders will have to pay to participate in Help to Buy and how much capital the banks will have to hold for those loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists are asking why, if banks are unwilling to take the extra risk of making such loans without government inducements, the government should be expected to backstop the program. Andrew Brigden, an economist at Fathom Consulting, said the program would make it easier for banks to make riskier loans. Help to Buy is a ''reckless scheme'' because it ''uses public money to incentivize the banks to lend precisely to those individuals who should not be offered credit,'' Mr. Brigden said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Osborne has argued that the program is fixing a mortgage market that has been discriminating against people who can afford the monthly mortgage payments but do not have enough savings for a down payment. Passing part of the lending risk from the banks to the government does not worry him, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Because it's a financial transaction, with the taxpayer making an investment and getting a return,'' Mr. Osborne said, ''it won't hit our deficit.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</p>

</div><div class="author">By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS   </div><div>468 words</div><div>24 August 2013</div><div>NYTimes.com Feed</div><div>NYTFEED</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013. The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A big jump in <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> helped lift the Dow Jones industrial average on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> had its biggest gain in four years after its chief executive, Steven A. Ballmer, said he would retire. The surge for the company, part of the 30-member Dow, contributed more than a third of the index’s advance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow closed up 46.77 points, or 0.3 percent, at 15,010.51.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stock market stumbled at midmorning after the government reported a plunge in new-home sales, then drifted steadily higher in the afternoon. Trading volume was very light.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department released data on July purchases of new homes, which showed that Americans had cut back sharply, a sign that higher mortgage rates may slow the housing recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of newly built homes dropped 13.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 394,000, the lowest in nine months. And sales fell from a rate of 455,000 in June, which was revised down from a previously reported 497,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing rebound that began last year has helped drive economic growth and create more construction jobs. But mortgage rates have climbed a percentage point since May. The increase has begun to steal some momentum from the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes are still up 7 percent in the 12 months ended in July. Yet the annual pace remains well below the 700,000 that is consistent with a healthy market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">July’s drop “may mark an ‘uh-oh’ kind of moment for the housing recovery,” said Mark Vitner, an economist at <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo Securities</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homebuilder stocks declined sharply on Friday. Shares of <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span>, <span class="companylink">D. R. Horton</span> and <span class="companylink">Lennar</span> — three of the nation’s largest builders — all fell more than 2.5 percent at the close of trading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traders reacted to the drop in home sales by buying bonds and gold, investments that become more attractive when the economy appears weaker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the market for government bonds, the price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 20/32 to 97 8/32, and its yield declined to 2.82 percent, from 2.89 percent late Thursday. The price of gold rose $25, or 1.8 percent, to $1,395 an ounce, the highest in two months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks have sagged in August on concerns that the Federal Reserve will start to pull back on its economic stimulus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor’s</span> 500-stock index edged up 6.54 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,663.50.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON — Sales of existing homes jumped in July to the highest level in more than three years, suggesting rising interest rates on mortgages were having only a limited impact so far on the housing market’s recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/national_association_of_realtors/index.html?inline=nyt-org]said on Wednesday[http://www.realtor.org/news-releases/2013/08/existing-home-sales-spike-in-july] that existing-home sales rose 6.5 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.39 million units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase in home sales exceeded Wall Street’s expectations and could make the Federal Reserve more comfortable with its plans to start winding down its economic stimulus program. Mortgage rates have been climbing in anticipation that the Fed will soon taper its stimulus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some of July’s surge in home resales may reflect buyers rushing to lock in mortgage rates before they rise further, the data inspired some confidence that the housing recovery was strong enough to withstand higher borrowing costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The basic take-away is that the rise in mortgage rates has been manageable,” said Ryan Sweet, an economist with <span class="companylink">Moody’s</span> Analytics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After being devastated by a financial crisis and the 2007-9 recession, the home market appeared to turn a corner early last year, helped by steady job creation and extremely low interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">July’s increase was the fastest pace of sales since November 2009, when a home buyer tax credit was expiring. Such a strong rate of growth could prove temporary, however.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Applications for mortgages to buy homes rose slightly last week, but they have fallen sharply since the spring and remain near a seven-month low, a separate report[http://www.mortgagebankers.org/NewsandMedia/PressCenter/85394.htm] from the Mortgage Bankers Association showed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We expect to see some moderation in activity in the coming months, as higher mortgage rates take some of the air from the recovery,” said Millan Mulraine, an economist at <span class="companylink">TD Securities</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since early May, interest rates for 30-year mortgages have risen more than a percentage point. Last week, the average rate for a 30-year mortgage climbed 12 basis points, or hundredths of a percent, to 4.68 percent while refinancing activity slumped, the Mortgage Banker Association said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed is currently buying $85 billion a month in Treasury and mortgage-backed bonds, but it is expected to scale back purchases as early as September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists polled by Reuters had expected home resales to increase to an annual rate of 5.15 million units in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price for a previously owned home rose 13.7 percent in July from a year earlier to $213,500. The inventory of unsold homes on the market rose 5.6 percent, for an unchanged 5.1-month supply.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alex Dietrich, a real estate agent with Nest Seekers International, has recently found himself fielding an unwelcome question from some clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They ask, 'Have you been demoted?''' said Mr. Dietrich, who was a vice president and managing director until earlier this year. ''It is not ideal.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dietrich has not been demoted, nor is he alone in his tumble from grace. Tens of thousands of real estate agents and brokers around New York were stripped of their corporate titles this year -- senior vice president, managing director and the like -- after the New York Department of State, which issues real estate licenses, said the use of corporate honorifics without any actual corporate duties was, in fact, illegal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That legal opinion swept aside the days when a vice president and managing director of a large firm, like Mr. Dietrich, would take the time to help you sell a $419,000 one-bedroom apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the State Department's opinion was released in April -- in response to a clarification request from the Real Estate Board of New York -- countless stacks of business cards and brochures have been dumped in the trash, and Web sites have been scrubbed clean of titles by agents eager to avoid fines of up to $1,000 per violation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There was a fair amount of hysteria,'' said Harriet Kaufman, a broker at <span class="companylink">Warburg Realty</span>, and once upon a time, a senior managing director.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, the rule is hardly new. It has been on the books for at least 50 years, according to the State Department, making it something closer to middle-aged. But few, if any, complaints were ever made about the issue, state officials say, and fines were exceptionally rare.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everybody started to try and outdo each other and it became Senior Executive Chief Whatever Bottlewasher,'' said Kirk Henckels, the vice chairman at Stribling. ''I can understand needing to clarify that for the public good.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate brokers (technically, they have the title ''licensed real estate broker'' or ''licensed associate real estate broker'') and agents (''licensed real estate salespeople,'' who work under a broker) are not generally staff employees of the firms on their business cards; they are independent contractors and split their commissions with the company. But according to the rule, to hold a corporate officer position, and therefore get to use the fancy title, one must be on staff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, agents and brokers at various real estate firms were awarded corporate titles over the years for reaching sales benchmarks, or for spending a certain number of years with the company -- though at a few firms, one could become a vice president just by walking in the door.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With fancier titles peeled away, some agents have requested clarification of the rule and permission to use alternate titles. Steven Spinola, the president of the real estate board, said the reaction from the commercial real estate community has been even stronger than from the residential world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marcos Vigil, the deputy secretary of state for business services and consumer protection, said that further guidance would be released in the next few weeks on what types of titles could be used and how.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some firms, however, have plunged ahead with new honorifics. Meet Nikki Field, a broker at <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>, and a newly minted senior global real estate adviser.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was a senior vice president, so I maintained the 'senior,' and global real estate adviser is exactly what I do,'' Ms. Field said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're in sales,'' she continued. ''My title gets in the door before I do.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frederick Peters, the president (really) of <span class="companylink">Warburg Realty</span>, said his firm also kicked around ideas for alternate titles, but without success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We couldn't come up with anything that didn't sound kind of silly,'' Mr. Peters said. ''Realistically, what are you going to do? Though several agents told me they wanted to be called 'Queen.' I loved that idea, 'Real Estate Queen.'''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While there are plenty of real estate professionals who are fine with the change, many brokers insisted during interviews that while the mood among their colleagues was grim, even depressed, they themselves were completely unfazed. (Mr. Peters of Warburg pointed out that this was a bit like going to the doctor as a teenager and saying you had a question about contraception for a friend.) Even among those who freely admit their disappointment, very few felt it would have an impact on their business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Maybe a handful of people have mentioned something, but it's not really noticed,'' said Jimmi Circosta, a broker (once senior vice president) at Citi Habitats. ''Which is depressing, too.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is some expense associated with the change, which varies enormously depending on a broker's enthusiasm for things like fliers. Jacky Teplitzky a broker (and former managing director) at <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>, and a devotee of thick mailings, said she expects to spend about $10,000 reprinting business cards, show sheets, press packets, and more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it is not just her title Ms. Teplitzky needs to fix. She also needs to change her name to comply with new state rules, that will go into effect in January, requiring that the name under which a broker is licensed be displayed in advertising. Nicknames like ''Jacky'' are no longer sufficient, so her new business card says ''Jaqueline (Jacky) Teplitzky.'' The same goes for maiden names, too, if the agent's married name is on the license.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I got married to a real estate developer named Guttman,'' said Penny Toepfer, a broker at Brown Harris Stevens, who was Penny Toepfer-Guttman on her license but not in business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I got divorced in Florida, and my lovely divorce attorney said, 'Don't worry about it,''' Ms. Toepfer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She didn't bother changing her name until the state announced the new rule. Thus began her visits to Lower Manhattan to get her maiden name legally restored. After several trips, she finally emerged victorious as Penny Toepfer, associate broker -- but not Ms. Toepfer, senior vice president.</p>

</div><div class="author">By CHARLES V. BAGLI   </div><div>1361 words</div><div>20 August 2013</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>13</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDThis hole in the ground is the length of three city blocks. It is a carpet of sand, weeds and prairie grass sloping down to the river, interrupted only by a low ridge of broken bedrock. Around it, a black chain-link fence catches the plastic cups, paper and other debris that roll along like tumbleweeds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this 6.4-acre parcel is not sitting in the middle of a decaying rust-belt city. It is nestled in the middle of Manhattan, between 38th and 41st Streets on First Avenue, overlooking the East River, amid a residential real estate boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet it has sat fallow for six years, long enough for young trees to rise at the edges of the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How one of the most valuable undeveloped pieces of earth has sat empty for years -- even after New York City approved a $4 billion project there in 2008 -- is a mysterious and confusing tale of ambition, infighting, clashing personalities and bad timing. At its heart is Sheldon H. Solow, an irascible but talented billionaire developer who is an intermittent presence in his office on 57th Street after a career that reaches back more than a half century.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This lot seems to be a prime candidate for development in the current market,'' said Ross Moskowitz, a real estate partner at <span class="companylink">Stroock &amp; Stroock &amp; Lavan</span>, who is not involved with the Solow site. ''With interest rates still very attractive and the capital markets looking for product, there appears to be unlimited appetite and demand for residential housing in New York.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Solow is not talking. Nor is his son Stefan, 38, who appears at the office, but not often at the same time as his father.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I can't tell you anything,'' said a family adviser, Thomas D. Thacher III.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Solow, 85, does not have much time to make his move. He must build the foundation for the office building or one of several apartment towers by November, or risk losing his permits and public approvals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Solow, a tall, well-dressed man who has been plagued by rumors about his health for three years, is an imposing figure with an impregnable confidence in his own vision. He has amassed quite an art collection, which includes works by Picasso, Matisse, Botticelli, Morris Louis, Balthus and Rothko.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He solidified his reputation in the 1970s when he built the swooping, 50-story office tower at 9 West 57th Street, which remains one of Manhattan's most sought-after addresses because of its unobstructed views of Central Park. By Mr. Solow's past account, he collaborated with the architect Gordon Bunshaft on the design.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The developer has a fierce determination to do things his way, regardless of others' advice or economic pressures. He refused to rent out the underground retail space at 9 West 57th for 30 years, waiting for the right tenant. Finally, Mr. Solow installed his own restaurant, Brasserie 8 ½, and lined the walls with some of his art.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Solow has also developed a reputation as one of the country's most litigious individuals, responsible for at least 200 lawsuits. He has sued friends, enemies, tenants and banks, not often with success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2000, Mr. Solow and the Fisher real estate family won a hotly contested auction for 9.2 acres of land along First Avenue. The hole in the ground is the largest of three noncontiguous parcels between 35th and 41st Streets that made up the property, which he bought from <span class="companylink">Consolidated Edison</span> for $630 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Solow spent nearly $100 million demolishing the Waterside power plant there and cleansing the land of toxic materials. In 2008, he had won city approvals for a $4 billion project designed in collaboration by <span class="companylink">Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill</span> and <span class="companylink">Richard Meier &amp; Partners</span> that included seven towers, five acres of public gardens and walkways, a public school and affordable housing. He also shed his partner, the Fisher family, after a bitter falling out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property between 38th and 41st Streets, on the east side of First Avenue, was to include a semicircular public pavilion designed by the architect Richard Meier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the city was in the grips of a severe recession, so little happened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2009, Mr. Solow's executive suite has had a revolving door as he fired one general counsel and chief operating officer after another, including Steven Cherniak, a 27-year veteran of the company. His long-running legal battle with <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> over a loan for the property ended with an $85.7 million judgment against him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the recession he also stopped work on Two Sutton Place North, a 37-story apartment building on East 61st Street, near York Avenue, and stubbornly refused to lease space in his signature building, 9 West 57th, which had a large block of vacant space after the <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> moved out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It appeared to many in the real estate industry that Mr. Solow was having cash-flow problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stefan Solow stepped in during his father's occasional absences from work, and quietly tried to settle a number of lawsuits, lease the vacant space in the tower at 9 West 57th and sell some land. Executives who have dealt with both men say the father and son are not often on the same page.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More recently, the Solows have offered conflicting signals as to their intentions. Their new broker, Scott Panzer of <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>, has signed new tenants -- <span class="companylink">Tiger Global Management</span> and <span class="companylink">Ruane, Cunniff &amp; Goldfarb</span>, at the top of 9 West 57th for some of the highest rents in the city, although real estate executives say there is still more than 600,000 square feet of space available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Work has also resumed on Two Sutton Place North.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Solow, who has rarely if ever sold a property or an artwork in his vast holdings, did both this year. In February, he closed on the $172.5 million sale of a two-acre parcel on First Avenue between 35th and 36th Streets, part of the Con Ed property, to Michael Stern at JDS Development, who has already broken ground on a pair of residential buildings on the site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The same month, he sold a painting through Christie's in London -- one of Modigliani's portraits of his lover Jeanne Hébuterne -- for $41.2 million, roughly $13 million more than he paid for it in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Characteristically, Mr. Solow also filed a fresh lawsuit, this one in federal court accusing <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span>, <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>, <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span>, <span class="companylink">UBS</span> and other banks of racketeering and a conspiracy to violate antitrust laws.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to executives who know Mr. Solow, he reconvened his development team about three months ago, eager to begin work on the hole in the ground, to demonstrate that he was serious and to capitalize on a surging market. But the group has not met again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He bought the land cheap,'' said Edward Rubin, an architect and a former member of Community Board 6. ''The rental market is really hot. Why it's still a hole in the ground, I don't know.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: August 22, 2013, Thursday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Tuesday about an undeveloped lot on the East Side of Manhattan referred incorrectly to a $4 billion project approved in 2008 for a stretch of land along First Avenue. It was designed in collaboration by <span class="companylink">Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill</span> and <span class="companylink">Richard Meier &amp; Partners</span> -- not solely by <span class="companylink">Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill</span>. The article also misstated, in some editions, part of the name of a tenant for 9 West 57th Street, a building also owned by the developer of the East Side lot. The tenant is <span class="companylink">Ruane, Cunniff &amp; Goldfarb</span>, not Ruane Dunniff &amp; Goldfarb.</p>
<p>Since before Sheldon Solow, shown above in 2006, won approvals  in 2008 for a $4 billion project in Murray Hill, the largest tract,  top, has been untouched. Now time to begin work is running out. (PHOTOGRAPHS BY SHIHO FUKADA FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES; JABIN BOTSFORD/THE NEW YORK TIMES)  MAP   </p>

</div><div class="author">By PAUL SULLIVAN </div><div>1423 words</div><div>17 August 2013</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DAN LINDSTROM remembers looking at a piece of Nebraska farmland six or seven years ago that cost $3,300 an acre. Raised on a farm, he ran the numbers with his brother who is farming the family land and concluded that it was too expensive. He figured that with a 2 to 3 percent return, it made more sense to put the money into a dividend-paying stock and have his brother lease additional land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few weeks ago, Mr. Lindstrom said similar land sold for nearly $11,000 an acre.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a common story across the farm belt. In Indiana, William C. Ade, who made a fortune in oil and gas exploration in Asia, said he stopped adding to his 1,000 acres when the price passed $5,000 an acre.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Right now it's at auction as high as $12,000 an acre,'' he said of land to grow corn and soybeans in northwest Indiana. ''A poor plot of land went for $8,000.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lindstrom, who is a financial adviser at <span class="companylink">UBS</span> Wealth Management in Omaha, and Mr. Ade, a member of the investment club Tiger 21, are among investors who say they believe farmland could be headed for a serious drop in values, if not a full-on crash. Of course, many of them have been thinking that for years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The traditional view of farmland, from the farmer to the agricultural economist to the investment adviser, is, as Mr. Ade put it, ''an inflation-proof bond.'' (''No one is going to steal it,'' he said. ''No one is going to default on it. If inflation goes up, it will still be there.'')</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the financial collapse of 2008, most forms of real estate were shunned. But not farmland. Prices shot up, driven by rising commodity prices from global demand, low interest rates in the United States and high auction prices begetting higher prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now commodity prices have fallen. Corn has gone to about $4.60 a bushel this week from over $8 a bushel last year. Soybeans have fallen to about $12.60 a bushel from over $17. Yet the value of farmland for row crops has continued to rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're kind of at an inflection point,'' said Brent Gloy, a professor of agricultural economics at <span class="companylink">Purdue University</span>. ''We've had five years of spectacular profitability that was somewhat unanticipated. The U.S.D.A. was forecasting much lower than this, so it surprised people.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet there are still reasons to think that there will be buyers for land who will hold on to it for decades to come. A report released by U.S. Trust highlighted the graying of America's farmers and their need to sell or lease their land as they age.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Can land go up and down?'' asked John Taylor, national farm and ranch executive for U.S. Trust, which manages 900 farms for investors. ''Sure. But I've never seen land go to zero. And with world demand, there is no vacancy factor on good U.S. farmland.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of this raises the issue of whether it is time to sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brian C. Duke, vice president for Northern Trust, said that even with the run-up in prices for commodities, the annual return of farmland remains about 3 percent. Since 2000, the value of land in Illinois, for example, has increased 207 percent. For an investment comparison, The Dow Jones industrial average went up 42 percent in that period. Triple-digit appreciation has a way of luring new investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More experienced investors said that appreciation isn't the goal: to realize it you have to sell the land. ''The capital gain is nice, '' said Albert Kirchner, who is known as Bud and owned a manufacturing company. ''We don't look at the capital gain. We look at it from a productivity standpoint.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kirchner owns 6,000 acres of corn and soybean land in Illinois, an 8,000-acre cattle ranch in Montana and 1,200 acres of timberland in Florida. But his benchmark since he started investing in land after World War II has remained a 4 percent annual return.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At that number and using Agriculture Department estimates that the average farmland value in Illinois is $7,800, Mr. Kirchner's land would be worth $46.8 million, with an annual return of $1,872,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for the person who has bought land recently at auction, getting even 4 percent becomes more challenging. At $12,000 an acre, a 4 percent return is $480. Kevin Casner, who farms 2,400 acres in Carrollton, Mo., with his son Adam, said the rents in his area ranged from $150 to $450 an acre. (Those rents were negotiated before commodity prices started to fall, and will presumably drop.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A landlord can squeeze a farmer only so far on rent. Mr. Lindstrom said that an acre of his family farm was producing 175 bushels of corn, which equals a little more than $740 at $4.25 a bushel. But a farmer has some pretty hefty fixed costs. He said that, per acre, seed is $100, nitrogen is $100, dry fertilizer is $100, taxes are $50, insecticide is $30, chemicals are $50, and cash rent is $300 on average. That is $680 without factoring in the cost of equipment and labor. There is no room to increase the rent in this example by $180 more an acre.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This balance between commodity prices and land values and rents can change. It is why all land investors need to have a long enough time frame. ''If you're wanting to park money for five years, farmland is really not what you should be investing in,'' Mr. Duke said. ''You need to have that longer-term approach.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many farmers and investors fear the past decade could be too much of a good thing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In real terms the gain we've seen in farmland values over the last 10 years are greater than those we saw in the 1970s,'' said Professor Gloy of <span class="companylink">Purdue</span>. In the early 1980s, farmland prices crashed when interest rates went up and farmers could not continue to borrow to finance their operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two things that could set off a decline are a further drop in commodity prices and higher interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Matt Ward, one of the owners of Premier Grain Farms in Walker, Iowa, said that a drop of $2 a bushel in the price of corn translated to a loss of about $400 an acre. If all 15,000 acres he farms were planted evenly, that would translate into $6 million less in revenue than the land produced last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors who have sharecropping agreements that designate a split in the harvest between farmer and owner will see their return reduced immediately. Those who have cash leases are likely to have to negotiate lower rents when the lease is renewed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another option for an investor has been a variable cash lease. The owner would accept a lower cash rent up front and negotiate an additional payment if the price of the commodity or the yield was higher. There is now less chance of upside potential.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for interest rates, the fear is that they will rise and the value of land will fall. Mr. Lindstrom, the farm owner who works for <span class="companylink">UBS</span>, said there was no way to finance land at today's rates of 5 percent and make money. Cash buyers, he said, are at risk of losing their principal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Could the land go from $10,000 to $15,000 an acre?'' he said. ''Sure, but not today and not with corn at $4.25. I'd be surprised if we don't go from $10,000 to $8,000 or $7,000. Land has tripled in the last five to six years.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, this was the man who passed on buying land at $3,300 an acre because he thought it was overpriced. ''We just tried to buy more ground and were willing to go to $7,500 an acre,'' Mr. Lindstrom said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It went for $10,500. My instincts tell me we'll buy that ground, and we'll buy it cheaper.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quick, name a New York neighborhood that has investors from China buying properties. Midtown? TriBeCa? The Upper East Side?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Guess again. They're going to Queens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The borough of airports and the Mets has boasted a thriving East-Asian community for decades, in Flushing, so perhaps the destination doesn't come as a total surprise. But when interest began to build among Chinese citizens a few years ago, its focus was a handful of high-end, high-rise condominiums in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, as the pool widens to include more upper-middle-class buyers -- and as Chinese investors overall diversify their bets -- Queens is reaping the benefits, according to developers, lenders and brokers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the beginning, there was a lot of well-to-do people from China buying here,'' said Bill Seto, a residential broker in Flushing who was born in Hong Kong but has worked around the city for three decades. ''But in the last year, it started to be different.'' Mr. Seto is also the president of the Chinese American Real Estate Association, a local trade group whose 350 members include lawyers, title companies and mortgage brokers. ''These new buyers have just come into wealth,'' he said, ''and they also want to invest it in New York.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Measuring this trend can be difficult; deeds don't generally indicate a buyer's country of origin. And because some buyers speak mostly Mandarin, and seek out agents who can do the same, the number of brokers who can reliably vouch for the phenomenon is limited.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, buyers from mainland China today can account for as many as half of the buyers at certain buildings in ''Falasheng'' (as the area is known in Mandarin) and surrounding neighborhoods, brokers say. A few years ago there were virtually none.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ten of the 21 units that have sold in the condominium portion of One Fulton Square, a mixed-use project on Prince Street in Flushing, have gone to Chinese buyers, according to Mr. Seto, who is marketing the project for the F&amp;T Group, the developer. One-bedrooms in the 43-unit building start at $550,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, overseas buyers are flocking to Sky View Parc, a 448-unit Flushing condo complex owned by Onex Real Estate Partners. About 135 of the 410 units that have sold so far have gone to buyers from China, said Helen Lee, an Onex director, adding that one-bedrooms, which started at $500,000, are now sold out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many Chinese buyers in this latest wave, the apartments are investments and will be rented out, according to Ms. Lee, who says that Sky View often has tenants lined up before a deal even closes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These tenants tend to be students at Queens College, the Fashion Institute of Technology or Parsons, the design school, though usually not the children of the buyers, she said; some of the buyers also own homes in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is no longer about going after some Fifth Avenue apartment for prestige and status,'' Ms. Lee declared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The influx of Chinese buyers has prompted several studies on their buying trends. Nationally, New York would appear to have some catching up to do. More Chinese buyers snapped up homes in California than in other states, according to a report on international buyers released in June by the National Association of Realtors. In fact, 53 percent of Chinese purchases in the United States were made in California, the report found. Illinois, with 5 percent, came in a distant second, followed by Massachusetts, North Carolina and Texas, in a three-way tie at 4 percent. New York had 3 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada is the country from which most foreign buyers are coming, representing 23 percent of all deals, the report found; China was second, with 12 percent, followed by Mexico, with 8 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But China accounted for just 5 percent of all foreign deals in 2009, the report noted, and that rose to 11 percent in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A comparable spike may be around the corner for New York City, according to Juwai.com, a Web site created to help buyers from China find overseas properties. Started in 2011, Juwai (pronounced JOO-why) offers a few million home listings in 53 countries. The site can be loaded either in simplified Chinese characters, for mainland Chinese, or traditional Chinese for people in Hong Kong and elsewhere. Unlike other real estate sites, Juwai, based in Shanghai, pays careful attention to its translations, said Andrew Taylor, a founder of the company, adding that the few English-based sites that try to translate listings often get it wrong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Chinese comes off at best, stupid, and at worst, misleading or offensive to the consumer,'' Mr. Taylor said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Juwai's precise translation costs brokers $158 a month for 20 listings, which also covers additional explanatory marketing on the Web page to help buyers distinguish between, say, Murray Hill in Manhattan and Murray Hill in Queens. In addition, Juwai operators field calls from buyers in a variety of Chinese dialects, before directing them to listing agents. Access for consumers is free.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, the United States has been the No. 1 search for Chinese buyers, according to a new Juwai report, with New York leading all other American cities. In May, New York was the recipient of 26,437 Web searches, versus 19,989 for Los Angeles and 16,434 for San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Queens draws the most interest; it had 9 of 10 of the most-searched neighborhoods from January through April, according to Juwai, whose listings emphasize middle-of-the-pack homes over luxury ones. Kew Gardens claimed the top spot, followed by Flushing and Forest Hills. Others that garnered interest were Elmhurst, Jackson Heights and Rego Park, where many Asian families have put down roots. Howard Beach, historically an Italian-American enclave, finished at No. 9. But there may be a simple explanation: Waterfront destinations account for about half of all the places around the world that Chinese buyers are interested in, according to Juwai, even if there's not much sand in Howard Beach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jacques Ambron, the broker/owner of Madeleine Realty in Forest Hills, says that in the last year he has begun receiving calls from China for the first time in his 32 years selling homes, and that those buyers appear interested in neighborhoods beyond Flushing. At a recent open house in Kew Garden Hills, all of the 20 buyers who lined up early to get in were Asian, he said, and a handful appeared to be from overseas. (The property was a fairly standard Queens dwelling -- a semidetached two-family with a small front yard. It was listed at $465,000, and sold for $483,000 to a local buyer, Mr. Ambron said.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Flushing has become so dense,'' he added, ''there may be nowhere to go but out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though people may be poring over listings 7,000 or so miles away, that doesn't mean they're all beating a path to New York. Some brokers who have Queens listings on the Juwai site say they have yet to hear from buyers from China. ''I really, really hope they come,'' said Carolyn DeFalco of Re/Max Liberty, who in July listed a two-bedroom condo with a private terrace in Howard Beach for $269,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Taylor noted that Chinese buyers face restrictions at home: the country limits how much money can be transferred out in a year, for example, and securing a visa to come over for house-hunting can take several months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, he said, the intense Chinese desire to invest in other places is being fueled by insecurity among the newly rich, who worry that their wealth could vanish if the political winds shifted. ''It will be interesting to see how these places go in the next six months,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another reason driving Chinese interest in overseas properties, according to Juwai and local real estate brokers, is education; many families want their children to enroll in American schools, whether public or private, and homes here can be a ticket in. Although the Chinese market may be widening, some constants still apply, brokers say. New construction is preferable to old, as are condominiums to co-ops. And for ideal feng shui, southern exposure tops a list of important factors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, of course, Manhattan continues to enjoy strong interest among Chinese buyers looking to spend $3 million and up. Luxury condominiums like the Aldyn, the Rushmore and Carlton House -- all uptown properties from the <span class="companylink">Extell Development Company</span> -- are a strong draw for Chinese, said Nikki Field of <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>, who in 2008 began reaching out to such clients. Last year 22 percent of her buyers were from China, she said, and she just hired a Mandarin-speaking associate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asher Alcobi, the president of Peter Ashe Real Estate on the Upper East Side, says that 30 percent of his business is from China, Hong Kong or Singapore. Two of the three condo units he recently sold at the Chelsea Green, now under construction in Chelsea, went to Chinese citizens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iris Chen of Hong Kong bought a one-bedroom there for about $1 million. In 2011 she acquired two one-bedrooms at Trump SoHo for a combined $1.8 million; they are rented out most of the time, though she occasionally stays there when visiting New York. Ms. Chen says she will very likely lease the Chelsea Green unit when the building opens next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The property market in China is too expensive; the same money here won't buy the same thing there,'' she said. ''Chinese people want new opportunities, which is why they are putting their money overseas.''</p>

</div><div class="author">By JOE GOSE </div><div>1179 words</div><div>7 August 2013</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2013 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long scarred as the site of brutal civil rights struggles and decades of industrial collapse, downtown Birmingham, Ala., has struggled to attract new business or visitors, even from its own region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some recent efforts give the city a bit of hope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The centrally located $25 million Railroad Park, 19 acres with lakes, an amphitheater and lots of green space, opened three years ago and has become a symbol for reviving the downtown district. Not only do thousands of tourists visit the park, but former city residents are also venturing downtown again after years of suburban life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As evidence of continued growth, Regions Field, an 8,500-seat minor-league baseball stadium, opened in April just south of Railroad Park, another downtown attraction for the city's roster. Other noteworthy projects include a heavily subsidized $70 million Westin Hotel and entertainment district in the city's convention area, and a $7 million renovation of the Lyric, a former vaudeville theater nearly 100 years old and barely used since 1958.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the downtown area somehow escaped the failed urban renewal efforts that razed buildings of historical significance in other cities, the district is home to an estimated 1.6 million square feet of largely vacant buildings constructed before World War II.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To help encourage more renovation, Alabama lawmakers in May approved a bill offering developers up to $5 million in state historical tax credits to help pay for projects. Other incentives, like federal historical tax credits and low-interest loans, are available, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The momentum downtown is palpable,'' said Derek R. Waltchack, a principal of Shannon Waltchack, a Birmingham-based property brokerage and investment firm. ''You have all the pieces in place for it to be really hot for the next 10 years.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That activity and other developments have created a buzz that downtown's resurgence is permanent, said David Fleming, chief executive of REV Birmingham, an economic development organization focused on revitalizing the city's urban areas. To him, that is the most critical transformation of all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The one thing that has changed a lot is the public's general attitude toward downtown,'' he said. ''There's a feeling that it is back, and that wasn't true 10 years ago.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city still faces a potential hurdle in persuading companies outside the area to relocate or expand downtown. Birmingham is the seat of Jefferson County, which in 2008 began wrestling with a daunting fiscal crisis when interest rates on a $3.2 billion sewer bond issue ballooned to 10 percent from 3 percent during the financial crisis. Unable to meet debt payments, the county eventually made a $4.2 billion bankruptcy filing in 2011 -- the largest government bankruptcy in United States history until Detroit's filing last month -- and residents and businesses are certain to face a big sewer rate increase as the case winds it way to settlement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bankruptcy may be keeping businesses outside Jefferson County from moving in, Mr. Fleming conceded, but he maintains that it has not dampened the optimism about downtown or hampered the ability of Birmingham to foster growth in the district.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I know that my sewer rates are going to go up,'' he said. ''But for everybody that's here, it's business as usual.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REV Birmingham estimates that around 9,400 people lived downtown and in neighborhoods immediately surrounding it at the end of 2010, an increase of 36 percent from 2000. While the organization does not have a firm number on how many people have moved downtown since then, more than 1,000 housing units are under construction or are in the planning stages. That would take the total residential stock in the city center to more than 4,000 units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among other projects, Bayer Properties of Birmingham next year intends to begin rehabilitating the Pizitz building, a former eight-story department store. The firm plans to gut the 90-year-old, terra cotta-clad structure and create 150 apartment units as well as 20,000 square feet of ground floor retail space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">State and federal historical tax credits and other incentives are important to the project's financing, representing some 20 percent or more of the $60 million cost, said David L. Silverstein, a principal of Bayer Properties. Mr. Silverstein and a business partner bought the building and an adjacent parking deck in 2000 with plans to redo it into offices and retail space. But the financial crisis delayed the development and gave the partners a chance to reassess.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There has been a tremendous amount of movement toward people living and working and shopping in downtown,'' he said. ''So when we bring this project online, we believe it will be well received by the market.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, law firms, architects, accountants and other professionals are repositioning old buildings, too, said John Lauriello, a principal of Southpace, a Birmingham-based property brokerage firm. The law firm Hollis Wright Clay &amp; Vail, for example, bought an 8,250-square-foot building in June and plans to move into it this fall after a renovation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Downtown also is attracting suburban companies that until recently would have never dreamed of moving to the district, said Mr. Lauriello, a longtime downtown proponent and business owner. Like others, he credits Railroad Park for changing attitudes, particularly among younger people who are not carrying the town's 1960s baggage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People that don't live here used to say with pride, 'I haven't been to downtown Birmingham for 10 or 15 years,' '' he said. ''They wore it as a badge of honor.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Waltchack, who operated his business in the suburbs for years, could have counted himself among them. But a trip to Railroad Park with his children soon after it opened helped change his mind about an investment opportunity in two buildings near the park that he had turned down a few months before. Eventually he and other investors bought the century-old structures and completed a $4 million renovation to turn them into 42,000 square feet of offices known as Railroad Square. Shannon Waltchack moved its offices into the project along with a handful of other tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Shannon Waltchack is spearheading a similar redevelopment for a two-story warehouse and surrounding buildings totaling 40,000 square feet near Regions Field. Plans for the warehouse call for first-floor commercial space, second-floor apartments, and a rooftop deck overlooking center field.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you would have called me four years ago and asked, 'Derek, would you consider moving your office downtown?' I would have said, 'Never,' '' Mr. Waltchack said. ''We're a good case study in how much things have changed here.''</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Overhaul of mortgage giants sought by Obama; Plan would reduce risk to government in event of another credit crisis</span>
</div><div class="author">By JACKIE CALMES   </div><div>871 words</div><div>7 August 2013</div><div>International Herald Tribune</div><div>INHT</div><div>14</div><div>English</div><div>© 2013 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another sign that the U.S. housing market has strengthened, President Obama went to Phoenix on Tuesday to outline his long-awaited ideas for overhauling the mortgage finance giants <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> to reduce the government’s risk significantly in any future credit crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to administration officials who spoke in advance of Mr. Obama’s remarks, he decided to endorse bipartisan efforts in the Senate to wind down the two companies and end their longtime implicit guarantee of a federal government bailout. In the financial crisis of 2008, <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, then bankrupt, were made conservators of the government at great cost to taxpayers, who only now are being repaid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The president decided he would sign into law only a measure that put private investors primarily at risk for the two companies, which buy and guarantee many mortgages from banks to provide a continuing stream of money for lenders to provide to additional home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An acceptable measure, the officials said, must specify the government’s role and liabilities for <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> and — unlike legislation in the House of Representatives — must ensure that Americans have continued access to a 30-year mortgage at a fixed interest rate, long the standard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Republicans who control the House would let the market determine whether to provide such mortgages, but the White House and the bipartisan Senate groups say that would make them more difficult to get and more costly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After years in which the formerly formidable <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> and their congressional allies blocked proposals for payment of fees or risk premiums, Mr. Obama is calling for financial institutions to pay an assessment to the government on the value of mortgage-backed securities. Under his proposals, the revenue would help provide assistance for borrowers and subsidize construction of homes and rental properties that would be affordable to lower-income Americans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since his first year in office, Mr. Obama has been under pressure to propose legislation to remake or break up <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, but the administration delayed those efforts while the housing market remained weak. By his advocacy now, aides say, Mr. Obama is putting his thumb on the scale in favor of bipartisan efforts in the Senate Banking Committee and against the House plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘The current housing finance system, where the government guarantees more than 80 percent of all mortgages through <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> and F.H.A., is unsustainable,’’ said a senior administration official who declined to be identified speaking in advance of the president’s appearance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phoenix has come to symbolize for Mr. Obama the depths of the housing bust and now its apparent recovery. Weeks after taking office in 2009, he went there to address ‘‘a crisis unlike we’ve ever known,’’ one ‘‘that strikes at the heart of the middle class.’’ More than four years later, in Phoenix as in much of the United States, home sales and values are up sharply from their nadir, and foreclosures are down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘We’re returning both because there has been significant progress in rebuilding the housing market in Phoenix and around the country more broadly, but also because there remains more work to do,’’ said a second senior administration official who also would speak only on the ground of anonymity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama administration’s initial housing measures did not achieve nearly the results predicted, in part because of financial institutions’ refusal to modify troubled mortgages or their slowness in doing so. The housing programs were modified several times, but even some supporters say Mr. Obama still has not done enough to relieve Americans who lost their homes as values plummeted or who kept their residences but owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth. On the other side of the spectrum, Republicans have opposed Mr. Obama’s programs as government bailouts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama proposed measures last year to allow more homeowners to be able to refinance while mortgage interest rates remain relatively low, including homeowners who do not have mortgages backed by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> or the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Mr. Obama is mainly addressing homeownership, he is also promoting affordable rental housing more than in the past. That reflects a broader shift in thinking after years in which the government promoted the American dream of homeownership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For some analysts, the crisis suggested that many Americans were pushed by banks and government policies into mortgages even though they could not bear the burdens of homeownership. Advocates of affordable housing have called for the government to ‘‘rebalance’’ its efforts, which they say have too long been skewed toward homeownership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">‘‘It’s refreshing to see the president acknowledge the importance of rental housing policy, too,’’ said Douglas Rice, an analyst at the left-leaning <span class="companylink">Center on Budget and Policy Priorities</span>. While more than one-third of American households are renters, he said, three-quarters of federal housing assistance benefits homeowners, especially through tax breaks, and more than half of the benefits go to households with annual incomes above $100,000.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON — American service industry businesses expanded in July at the fastest pace since February, driven by a brisk month of sales and a jump in new orders. The increase suggests economic growth could be picking up after a weak start.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management said on Monday that its index of service-sector growth rose in July to 56, up from 52.2 in June. Any reading above 50 indicates expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey[http://www.ism.ws/ISMReport/NonMfgROB.cfm?navItemNumber=12943] covers businesses that employ 90 percent of the work force, involved in activities like retailing, construction, health care and financial services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A measure of business activity, which includes current sales, rose to 60.4. That is the highest reading since December and it was partly driven by faster home construction. And a measure of new orders, which indicates sales over the next few months, increased to 57.7, a five-month high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jennifer H. Lee, an economist at BMO Capital Markets, said 16 of the 18 industries surveyed reported growth in July, calling the report “encouraging news for the broader U.S. economy.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Dales, a senior economist at Capital Economics, said the July gains in the service sector and a solid month of manufacturing growth, hinted the economy was growing at an annual rate of 3 percent in the July-September quarter. That is nearly double the rate in the previous quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One concern is that a measure of employment at service companies fell in July. That echoed last week’s government employment report that showed hiring had slowed in July. Employers added 162,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department said on Friday. Most new jobs were in low-paying industries — half were at retail businesses or restaurants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Service industry growth depends largely on consumers, whose spending drives about 70 percent of economic activity. On Friday, the government said consumer spending rose in June at the fastest pace in four months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the economy grew at a tepid 1.7 percent annual rate[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/01/business/economy/us-economy-grew-by-1-7-in-2nd-quarter-faster-than-expected.html] from April through June, the service-sector activity follows reports that point to growth. Home sales and prices continue to rise, and Americans’ confidence in the economy last month stayed close to a five-and-a-half-year high.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON — Home prices jumped 12.2 percent in May compared with a year earlier, the biggest annual gain since March 2006. The increase shows the housing recovery is strengthening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Standard &amp; Poor’s/Case-Shiller[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/s/standard_poors_caseshiller_home_price_index/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] 20-city home price index released on Tuesday also surged 2.4 percent in May from April. The month-over-month gain nearly matched the 2.6 percent increase in April from March — the highest on record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price increases were widespread. All 20 cities showed gains in May from April and compared with a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices in Dallas and Denver reached the highest level on records dating to 2000. That is the first time since the housing bust that any city has reached a record high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report issued on Tuesday showed that Americans’ confidence in the economy fell only slightly in July but stayed close to a five-and-a-half-year high, a sign that consumers should continue to help drive growth in the coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home values are rising as more people are bidding on a relatively tight supply of houses for sale. One concern is that rising mortgage rates could slow home sales. But many economists say rates remain low by historical standards and would need to rise much faster to halt the momentum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Svenja Gudell, senior economist at Zillow, a home price data provider, said a big reason for the recent price gains was that foreclosed homes made up a smaller proportion of overall sales. Foreclosed homes are usually sold by banks at low prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Typical home values have appreciated at roughly half this pace for the past several months, which is still very robust,” Ms. Gudell said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Gudell said higher mortgage rates and a probable increase in the number of homes for sale in the coming months should slow the pace of price gains and stabilize the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S.&amp; P./Case-Shiller index covers about half of American homes. It measures prices compared with those in January 2000 and creates a three-month moving average. The May figures are the latest available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the recent gains, home prices for much of the country are still about 25 percent below the peaks they reached in July 2006. That is a major reason the supply of homes for sale remains low, as many homeowners are waiting to recoup their losses before putting their houses on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Conference Board[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/conference_board/index.html?inline=nyt-org], a private research group based in New York, said on Tuesday that its consumer confidence index dipped to 80.3 in July. That is down from a reading of 82.1 in June, which was revised slightly higher and was the best reading since January 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the slight drop in July, confidence remains well above year-earlier levels. And consumers are more optimistic about the current job market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Over all, indications are that the economy is strengthening and may even gain some momentum in the months ahead,” said Lynn Franco, an economist for the <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amna Asaf, an economist at Capital Economics, attributed the July drop in confidence to rising gasoline prices. But she said the confidence index remained at a level that was consistent with stronger growth in consumer spending in the July-to-September quarter.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It can only get better from here — or at least that’s what economists hope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New data from the government due out Wednesday is expected to show that the economy came close to stalling during the spring quarter, which ran from April through June. But many experts say the latest slowdown is likely to be temporary. Buoyed by a healthier housing sector, a surging stock market and resilient consumer spending, they say, economic activity should rebound in the second half of 2013 and accelerate into 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’ve been saying for some time that second-quarter growth would be the weak spot this year,” said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS. “This is the spring swoon. But I wouldn’t panic — there is a very specific reason for it, and it will start to wear off.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Housing has been sizzling and consumers are spending at a decent pace,” he added. “Businesses have held back so far, but will begin to get on board.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But haven’t we heard that one before? The latest swoon looks a lot like the previous pauses that have prevented the economy from gaining much momentum since the recession ended in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts estimate that the economy grew at an annual rate of under 1 percent in the second quarter, half the already tepid pace of growth in the first quarter of 2013. Much of that weakness stems from the tax increases and automatic cuts in government spending that went into effect earlier this year, headwinds that should gradually ease in the quarters to come unless Washington makes things worse by cutting spending further or Congress and the White House send markets into a swoon by failing to agree on a painless way to raise the nation’s debt ceiling[http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/subjects/n/national_debt_us/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Reserve[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/f/federal_reserve_system/index.html?inline=nyt-org] policy makers, who are set to meet on Tuesday and Wednesday, will be closely analyzing these crosscurrents. The central bank has been purchasing $85 billion a month in Treasury bonds[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/t/treasury_department/treasury_securities/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and government-backed mortgages — a program which the Fed’s chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, has hinted will be slowly wound down later this year if the economy proves strong enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed is not expected to signal a change in direction when it issues its latest statement early Wednesday afternoon. The data on economic growth due out Wednesday morning, however, as well as the latest figures on employment that will be released by the Labor Department on Friday, could help determine whether the Fed begins tapering back as early as September or instead waits until December or even longer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The Fed will have a lot of information,” said Michelle Meyer, senior United States economist at <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span><span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span>. “Our baseline scenario is that December is marginally more likely than September, but it is a very close call.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street is intensely focused on when the Fed will begin easing back, and traders will be paying close attention to any change in the language of the Fed’s statement. In May and June, stocks fell after Mr. Bernanke seemed to suggest the tapering could begin soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, though, Wall Street has bounced back and Mr. Bernanke emphasized in testimony before Congress earlier this month that the central bank was committed to bolstering the economy, easing fears of an abrupt tapering. In fact, he highlighted the risk that “tight federal fiscal policy will restrain economic growth over the next few quarters by more than we currently expect.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other questions are looming, too. Besides the issue of whether businesses will start investing at a faster pace, the recent rise in mortgage rates has some observers worried that the housing market could cool. The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> reported on Monday that its index for pending home sales dropped 0.4 percent in June, a sign buyers may be getting more cautious as borrowing costs increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More clues about the health of the housing sector will come on Tuesday, with the release of the latest figures in the S.&amp; P./Case-Shiller index for home prices. Economists are expecting the index for May to post a 12.3 percent gain over the same month a year earlier, a reflection of what has been a strengthening housing market in many parts of the country. The Conference Board is also scheduled to report its latest reading on consumer confidence on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts who are fairly optimistic in the long-term, like Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, caution that Wednesday’s numbers on overall economic performance could look rather bleak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The second quarter was horrible, no matter how you slice it,” he said. “The crunch in government spending is holding back growth and it doesn’t just appear in the government component. It feeds pretty much into everything.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Shepherdson is actually a bit more pessimistic about the current situation than many of his peers — he says he believes the economy grew at only 0.5 to 0.6 percent in the second quarter — but he emphasized that Wednesday’s report on gross domestic product was something of a wild card.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventory changes are hard to predict, as is the full impact of the cutbacks in Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We could be anywhere from minus 0.5 percent to plus 1.5 percent,” he said. “I wouldn’t be surprised if we saw a negative number.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as economists on Wall Street, at the Federal Reserve and elsewhere study the data for the second quarter, government statisticians at the Commerce Department’s <span class="companylink">Bureau of Economic Analysis</span> will also be undertaking a comprehensive revision of how they measure the economy itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bureau will now count expenditures on research and development as akin to more traditional business investment, as well as make adjustments for the value of artistic property like movies and books. Pension plans will also be measured differently. It is the first revision of its kind since July 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All together, these changes will affect reports of economic activity going back decades and are expected to increase the estimated size of the American economy by roughly $400 billion. That may be less than 3 percent of the nation’s $16 trillion in annual output, but it’s larger than the entire economy of dozens of countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while no one will notice the difference in their own lives, in the world of economics, the bureau’s revision is a major event. “For numbers geeks like myself,” Mr. Behravesh said, “these changes are anticipated with great interest.”</p>
