Sales of Existing Homes Set Record Last Year

WASHINGTON, Jan 28 -- Sales of previously owned homes increased 5.2
percent in December, helping to push their sales in 2002 to the highest
level on record, the National Association of Realtors said today.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The housing market thrived even though the American economy, knocked
back by the 2001 recession, struggled to regain a solid footing and
suffered through uneven growth.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
An estimated 5.56 million previously owned homes were sold in 2002,
topping the record of 5.30 million reached in 2001, the association
reported.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Housing remains one of the sole pillars of strength for the U. S.
economy,'' said Lynn Reaser, chief economist at Bank of America Capital
Management. ''Consumers remain willing to undertake longer-term
commitments in terms of purchases of both autos and homes.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Sales of previously owned homes rose to a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of 5.86 million last month. The annualized rate reflects the number
of homes that would sell if the same number of sales in one month
continued for 12 months.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Exceptionally low mortgage interest rates are the primary factor in
record levels of home sales,'' said David Lereah, chief economist at the
National Association of Realtors.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Low mortgage rates encouraged many people to buy homes last year or
refinance those they owned. Another factor motivating home buyers was
solid appreciation of housing values. That offers people attractive
investment, especially given the turbulent stock market, economists
said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The national median home price last year was $158,300, up 7.1 percent
from 2001. The 7.1 percent increase was the largest annual increase
since 1980, when the median sales price increased 11.7 percent.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Sales in the West rose 7.5 percent in 2002 from the previous year, to
1.49 million. In the Midwest, sales rose 4.9 percent, to 1.22 million,
and in the South, sales went up 4.1 percent, to 2.2 million. In the
Northeast, sales increased to 653,000, a 2.4 percent rise from 2001.

December Housing Rose 5%, Ending the Best Year Since '86

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON, Jan 21 -- Starts of construction on new homes and
apartments rose 5 percent in December, the Commerce Department reported
today, ending the best year for new housing since 1986.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The report said that builders broke ground on 1.84 million new homes
and apartments at a seasonally adjusted annual pace in December compared
with a 1.75 million pace in November.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
For the year, work was started on 1.70 million homes and apartments,
up 6.4 percent from 2001.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
All the building was bolstered by the lowest mortgage rates since the
1960's.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Housing was a bright spot in the economy last year amid an often
lukewarm recovery from recession. The unemployment rate at year's end
stood at 6 percent, and many analysts think it could go higher in coming
months as concerns intensify about the effects of an Iraq war on the
economy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The report on housing starts showed that at a seasonally adjusted
annual pace, builders began construction on 1.47 million single-family
homes in December, up 4.9 percent from the November pace. This was the
best monthly building pace for single-family homes since November 1978.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The pace of apartment construction rose 3.9 percent in December from
November, to a seasonally adjusted annual 321,000 units, the strongest
pace since August.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Building was up in all regions, led by an 18.2 percent increase in
the Northeast, where construction climbed to an annual pace of 169,000
units. In the West, it rose 9.7 percent to an annual 471,000 units. The
Midwest had an increase of 4 percent, to 390,000, and the South recorded
the smallest gain in construction activity, a December increase of 0.6
percent, which pushed building activity to an annual pace of 805,000
units.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
For the year, construction activity on 1.70 million new homes and
apartments, compared with 1.60 million in 2001, was the best showing
since 1.81 million homes and apartments were built in 1986.

Construction Spending Up In November

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON, Jan. 3 -- Construction spending rose for a third
consecutive month in November as the lowest mortgage rates in three
decades spurred record home sales.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The amount spent on homes, hotels and highways increased 0.3 percent
from the previous month after the October gain was revised up to 1
percent, the Commerce Department said. The $843.2 billion spent in
November was the most since May.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The increase adds to evidence that a sluggish economic recovery is
gathering momentum. The Institute for Supply Management said Thursday
that its manufacturing index rose the most in 11 years in December, and

The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate fell to 5.85 percent this
week, the lowest since 1965. Cheaper financing has allowed more
Americans to become first-time homeowners. Construction accounts for
almost 5 percent of the United States economy, and residential building
makes up half of construction spending.

The National Association of Realtors' home-buyer affordability index

months.

Two Reports on Economy Fall Short of Forecasts

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON, Dec. 30 -- Two economic reports released today fell short
of analyst expectations, with the housing market cooling from a record
pace and manufacturing expanding though still fragile.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
One report showed that business activity in the Midwest slowed in
December from November. The Chicago purchasing management index showed a
continued expansion in manufacturing but at a pace that remained
sluggish.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In the other report, the National Association of Realtors said that
sales of existing homes fell 3.5 percent in November, a surprisingly
steep slide.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Sales of previously owned homes slowed to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 5.56 million units in November, from a pace of 5.76
million in October, the association said. Analysts had expected 5.63
million.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''There is a decline but the level of activity is still the sixth
highest ever,'' the group's chief economist, David Lereah, said. ''The
level of sales is still very strong.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Analysts said they were not surprised that housing was declining from
its breakneck pace.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''It's still a very good sales rate for any month,'' said Richard
DeKaser, chief economist for the National City Corporation, a banking
company in Cleveland.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Economists said home sales were likely to taper off in 2003 as
borrowing costs rise in an anticipated economic recovery. Saturation is
also expected to play a role.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''There are only so many houses a person can buy; there won't be as
much pent-up demand next year,'' said Christine Chmura of Chmura
Economics and Analytics. ''Total housing sales should be off by 5
percent in 2003 from 2002.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In the manufacturing report, the National Association of Purchasing
Management-Chicago index, which surveys companies in the manufacturing
and service sectors, declined to a weaker-than-expected 51.3 in
December, from 54.3 in November. A reading below 50 indicates a regional
manufacturing sector that is contracting, while a reading above 50
signals expansion.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The index fell below 50 in September and October, showing contraction
for the first time in eight months.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In a positive sign, the employment component of the index climbed to
50.3, from 43.3 in November, rising above the crucial 50 mark for the
first time since March.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Analysts warned that one month's data is not enough to conclude that
a hiring turnaround has occurred.

Home Sales Set a Record In November

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON, Dec. 27 -- Sales of new homes rose a surprising 5.7
percent in November, a government report said today, as the lowest
mortgage rates in more than three decades encouraged buyers.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''We may see housing activity stay strong for quite a while,'' said
David Berson, chief economist at Fannie Mae, the big buyer of mortgages.
''Our forecast is for a small dip in home sales next year, but I would
emphasize the word small.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Single-family home sales jumped to a record 1.069 million annual rate
in November, the Commerce Department said. It was the fourth consecutive
month that the rate was above one million, which is also a record. The
demand was led by homes priced below $150,000, partly because of a 41
percent surge in the Midwest and a slump in the more expensive
Northeast. The median price dropped to $167,300, from $178,900 in
October, the biggest decline since July, as sales of homes that cost
more than $300,000 slipped.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
With the average 30-year fixed mortgage at 5.93 percent, demand is
likely to remain strong for houses and the furnishings and appliances
needed to fill them. Consumers will buy an estimated 969,000 new homes
this year, exceeding last year's record by 61,000, the National
Association of Home Builders said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''This is really good news for the economy,'' said James F. Smith,
director of the Kenan Institute's Center for Business Forecasting at the
University of North Carolina, who is also the chief economist of the
Society of Industrial and Office Realtors. ''I don't know anybody who
buys a house and doesn't buy lots of other things to go in the house.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
November's annual rate was up from a revised pace of 1.011 million
homes in October and beat the previous record of 1.053 million in
September. Economists had expected the rate to fall to one million. New
homes account for 15 percent of all sales, with previously owned homes
accounting for the rest.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The inventory of new homes for sale declined to a 3.8-month supply in
November from 4 months, the Commerce Department report said. The supply
was the lowest since last December.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The number of new homes for sale fell to 337,000 last month, from
339,000 in October. The median number of months that new homes have been
for sale declined to 3.9 in November from 4 months.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Next year, new home sales may total 938,000, which would be the
second-best year on record, according to forecasts by the builders'
group.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage dropped to 5.94 percent
in mid-November, at that time the lowest in three decades, according to
Freddie Mac, which also buys mortgages. Even lower rates this week may
help keep demand strong. The rate dropped to 5.93 percent for the week
that ends today, the lowest since 1965, Freddie Mac said.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Manufacturing contracted for a third consecutive month in November,
and with businesses still reluctant to invest heavily in an uncertain
economy, factory sluggishness is showing little sign of ending soon, a
report released yesterday indicated.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Institute for Supply Management said its index of manufacturing
business conditions was at 49.2 in November, below forecasts of 51.3 and
under the 50 level that separates expansion from contraction.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Manufacturing makes up about a fifth of the economy, but carries
greater importance because so much business investment in heavy-duty
capital goods is related to factories.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Employment in manufacturing continued to decline in November, and
that index remained below the 50 level for the 26th consecutive month --
at 43.8, down from 45.0 in October.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''The manufacturing sector remains stagnant,'' said Stephen Stanley,
senior market economist at RBS Greenwich Capital Markets. ''The
new-orders decline and employment declines were not a good sign.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Yesterday's main index reading was above the October level of 48.5,
but below the 49.5 of September.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Norbert J. Ore, who oversees the monthly survey for the institute,
which is based in Tempe, Ariz., said, ''The trend is well established
that the overall economy is holding up, but the manufacturing sector is
feeling the brunt of the downturn.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The institute's new-orders index fell in November to 49.9, from 50.9
in October and 50.2 in September. A barometer of future production, the
new-orders index is down sharply from a peak of 65.3 in March.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said yesterday that
spending for new construction rose 0.3 percent in October.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Nonresidential construction rose for the first time since April
because of increases in the building of schools and stores, the report
said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Outlays for all construction spending increased to a seasonally
adjusted annual pace of $834.6 billion in October from a downward
revised $832.5 billion in September.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
At the same time, gains in housing prices slowed over all in the
third quarter as the values of some homes, especially in the Midwest,
declined from the previous quarter, a government agency said yesterday.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Average home values in the third quarter rose 6.16 percent compared
with figures in the period a year earlier, the Office of Federal Housing
Enterprise Oversight said. That was slower than the 7.31 percent rise in
the second quarter.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Average nationwide house prices rose 0.84 percent from the second
quarter, the agency said in a quarterly report. That was less than the

3rd-Quarter Growth Revised Upward, to 4%

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON, Nov. 26 -- The economy grew more briskly in the third
quarter than first thought, with car sales helping to more than triple
the second-quarter pace, the Commerce Department reported today.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Other reports, however, sent crossed signals. One showed consumer
sentiment posting a smaller-than-expected rise this month after the
nine-year low set in October. New-home sales in October, however,
remained strong, falling moderately from September's record level.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Commerce Department said that gross domestic product rose at a
revised 4 percent annual rate in the period ended in September after a
1.3 percent gain in the previous quarter. The agency had originally
estimated that the economy grew 3.1 percent in the third quarter.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A buildup of business inventories helped account for the upward
revision, but there was a fall in corporate spending, which was
originally reported as rising a bit.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Businesses increased inventories by $15.5 billion in the third
quarter after a rise of $4.9 billion in the second. Business spending on
facilities and equipment dropped 0.7 percent -- the eighth consecutive
quarterly decline -- as the revisions erased a previously reported gain.
Within that category, spending on equipment and software increased.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Consumer spending rose 4.1 percent after an 1.8 percent gain in the
second quarter and accounted for most of the quarter-to-quarter
improvement. A sharp gain in auto sales played a big role.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
While growth in the third quarter was strong, several signs,
including weakness in manufacturing and a slide in car sales, have
suggested that the economy began to brake sharply as the quarter ended.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Conference Board, a private research organization, reported today
that its consumer confidence index rebounded in November, but the rise
to 84.1, from 79.6 in October, was smaller than expected. The index
remained well below September's reading of 93.7.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Most of the index's gain came from optimism on the economy's
six-month outlook.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''The rebound in expectations suggests consumers do not expect
economic conditions to become worse,'' said Lynn Franco, director of the
board's research center. She said the report signaled ''brighter holiday
spending than was anticipated only a month ago.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But the report was not without dark spots. Over 27 percent of those
surveyed said jobs were hard to get, the largest proportion in more than
eight years.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In a third report, the Commerce Department said that sales of new
single-family homes in October slipped from September's record pace,
dropping 4.5 percent, to an annual rate of 1.007 million units. Despite
the slide, it was still the third best monthly sales rate on record.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The decline in new-home sales in October was centered in the
Northeast and Midwest. Sales in the Northeast slid by 32.3 percent, to a
65,000 annual rate from a pace of 96,000 in September. Sales of new
homes in the Midwest dropped 17.1 percent, to a 165,000 annual rate.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In the South, the largest market for new homes, sales increased 1.2
percent, to a 489,000 rate. Sales also gained in the Western region,
rising 4.3 percent to a 288,000 annual rate.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON, Nov. 26 -- Sales of previously owned homes registered
their third-best month on record in October and are on track to reach an
all-time high this year, as low mortgage rates turned house hunters into
buyers.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The National Association of Realtors reported today that
existing-home sales climbed to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 5.77
million in October, a 6.1 percent jump from the month before.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
October's performance, which followed a 2.6 percent advance in sales
in September, exceeded expectations. Analysts were forecasting a small
dip in last month's sales.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Housing has been a pillar supporting the economy as it struggles to
return to full health. ''With mortgage rates dropping to more than
30-year lows, people are viewing this as a home-buying bonanza,'' said
Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at the PNC Financial Services Group.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Although many analysts think the economy has lost momentum this
quarter, they said that yesterday's report reinforced their view that
the country would avoid a return to recession.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The 5.77 million sales pace in October tied with April's as the
third-highest monthly level on record. Existing-home sales for all 2002
are expected to break the record set last year, the Realtors' group
said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The national median price of an existing home rose to $159,600 in
October, a 9.8 percent increase from the level of October 2001. It was
the largest increase since July 1987.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Maury Harris, chief economist at UBS Warburg, said, ''The rise in
housing wealth implied by these higher home prices will continue to help
offset earlier losses of stock market wealth and enhance household
spending power in a period of limited hiring.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
By region, home sales rose in the Northeast to an annual pace of
680,000, a 7.9 percent increase in October from September. In the West,
sales were up 7.1 percent, to a pace of 1.50 million. In the South,
sales rose 5.5 percent, to a 2.31 million pace. For the Midwest, sales
increased 4.1 percent, to a pace of 1.27 million homes.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 20 -- Housing starts dropped sharply in October,
falling 11.4 percent, the Commerce Department reported today. Economists
said the decline was probably weather related.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Groundbreaking for new homes showed the biggest monthly drop since
January 1994 and erased a big gain in September, the agency said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The pace of starts was the slowest since April, but economists said
it remained relatively high, and they cited heavy rain in October as a
potential factor for the decline.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Looking at what we have from the weather bureau for October,
virtually all the regions in the country, except for the west region,
were unusually wet,'' said David Seiders, chief economist for the
National Association of Home Builders.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The West was the only region of the country to record a gain in the

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Over all, groundbreaking for new homes slid to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 1.603 million units last month from a downwardly revised
1.810 million in September.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
While housing starts fell, building permits, an indication of builder
confidence, rose 1.7 percent, to 1.763 million units. Economists said
the rise in permits and a climb in mortgage applications signaled
stamina in the housing sector .

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Despite the drop in October, economists said the fundamentals for the
housing sector were good.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''There is little doubt that the fundamentals for the housing sector
are extremely favorable,'' said Kevin Cummings of RBS Greenwich Capital.
''Mortgage rates are at their lowest level in almost 40 years,
demographics are positive, resulting in part from high levels of
immigration, and people have a new-found appreciation for the wisdom of
investing in real estate in the wake of the stock market plunge.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Housing starts had posted their biggest gain in seven years in
September as buyers seized on low mortgage interest rates to snap up
homes in large numbers. The October rate was still 4.7 percent higher
than the 1.531 million level in October last year.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Ian Morris, chief economist at HSBC Securities, said that ''1.6
million units is still a high level.''

Single-family housing starts, the biggest category of building, slid
7.0 percent in October, to a 1.350 million unit annual rate. Multifamily
housing starts tumbled 31.4 percent to their lowest level since January
1997.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON, Oct. 25 -- The nation's hard-hit manufacturers suffered
another drop in demand for their products while consumer confidence slid
to the lowest level in nearly 10 years, according to reports issued
today.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Housing, however, remained one of the few bright spots as sales of
both new and existing homes posted strong increases in September.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Commerce Department said that orders to factories for big-ticket
durable goods fell 5.9 percent in September, the biggest decrease in 10
months and the third decline in the last 4 months. The new weakness was
led by a huge plunge in orders for communication equipment, but the
declines were widespread across most industries.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Consumer confidence as measured by a University of Michigan survey
declined to 80.6 this month, the lowest level since 1993, as Americans
were unnerved by the falling stock market and rising concerns about a
possible war with Iraq.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The decline was the fifth consecutive one and raised worries that
consumer spending, the biggest prop holding up the economy, could be in
danger of faltering.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Unless the downward momentum is quickly halted, the accumulated
loss in consumer confidence could tip the economy back into recession,''
said Richard Curtin, director of the Michigan survey.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The brightest spot for the economy continued to be housing sales,
with new-home sales rising 0.4 percent in September, to a record annual
rate of 1.021 million units, while sales of existing homes were up 1.9
percent, to an annual rate of 5.4 million units.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Both home and car sales have been strong this year, reflecting the
Federal Reserve's decision to keep a crucial interest rate at a
four-decade low. But private economists worried about what could take up
the slack if consumers decide to take a breather.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''The economy is creeping ahead, but only just barely,'' said Bill
Cheney, chief economist at John Hancock Financial Services in Boston.
''As long as another shoe doesn't drop, we'll probably be fine.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The worse-than-expected 5.9 percent decline in orders for durable
goods followed news earlier this week of a fourth consecutive monthly
decline in the index of leading economic indicators, indicating weakness
for the next six months, and the Fed's latest survey of business
conditions showing sluggish sales and a lackluster job market.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The 5.9 percent drop in orders for durable goods in September came
after a 0.6 percent decline in August and a 4.5 percent drop in June.
Only July posted an increase during this period, a gain of 8.5 percent.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of
Manufacturers, said factories were struggling to mount an ''uneven
recovery'' with ''uncertainty regarding the stock market and possible
war in the Middle East'' continuing to impede business investment.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Analysts noted that orders for nonmilitary capital goods, considered
a barometer of business investment plans, fell 12.6 percent in September.

Cheap Mortgages, Expensive Debt

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON -- FIRST it was the stock market. Now the question is
whether the housing market, the primary generator and repository of
wealth for most people, is a bubble.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
At a time when the recovery from the recession last year is
sputtering, the outlook depends heavily on how much longer the economy
can rely on surging home prices, low interest rates and the willingness
of consumers to keep borrowing and spending. The direction of housing
values could also help determine whether the American economy will
bounce back gradually or risk a long slide, like the one afflicting
Japan, where a downward spiral in stock and real estate values has
depressed the world's No. 2 economy for more than a decade.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In retrospect, economists from Alan Greenspan on down agree that the
run-up in stock prices in the late 1990's was unsustainable. But even as
Wall Street has wiped out trillions of dollars of wealth, the economy
has been kept afloat partly by what some analysts consider another
example of ephemeral financial levitation: a continued sharp rise in
home prices, even in the face of the stock slump, fueled by low interest
rates.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The median price of a single family home in August, the most recent
month for which figures are available, was $163,600, up 6.4 percent from
a year earlier, according to the National Association of Realtors. In
many regions, the increases have been considerably higher, and in some
places, the prices have been breathtakingly high.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In Orange County, Calif., the median price of $411,000 this summer
was 16.6 percent higher than a year earlier. In the Washington region,
the median price of $249,700 was up 20.8 percent. In Bergen and Passaic
counties in New Jersey, the increase was 24.7 percent, to $338,800.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
At the same time, consumer debt levels -- fueled in part by the
ability of homeowners to borrow against the rising value of their houses
-- have risen to worrisome levels.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mortgage foreclosures hit a record 1.23 percent of all home loans in
the second quarter, up from 1.10 percent in the previous quarter and
exceeding the previous record of 1.14 percent in the first quarter of
1999, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association of America. Total
household debt as a percentage of disposable personal income has risen
to 107 percent from 96 percent in 1996, according to the Federal
Reserve.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The housing market is ''bubble-like,'' argues Allen Sinai, chief
economist of Decision Economics, a consulting firm. ''Real estate hangs
out there now as the only asset that hasn't yet been hit,'' he said.
''History tells us things don't usually turn out that way.''
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
So far, the combination of low interest rates and rising housing
values has been invaluable in offsetting a deep slump in spending by
companies, which remain reluctant to invest in new plants and equipment
when they are plagued by overcapacity and worried about terrorism and a
possible war with Iraq.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Taking advantage of bargain financing deals, consumers have snapped
up automobiles, keeping a big industry humming. Most of all, low
mortgage rates have set off waves of refinancing, allowing homeowners to
put more money in their pockets by reducing their monthly payments or
borrowing more against the increased value of their houses.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Greenspan and many other economists see no evidence that
consumers are staggering under their debt loads at the moment or that
housing prices have reached irrational levels.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''We've looked at the bubble question, and we've concluded that it is
most unlikely,'' Mr. Greenspan told a Congressional committee last
summer, adding that plenty of reasons exist for home prices to be
rising, from low rates to a lack of land in many regions.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''This isn't Japan, and this isn't like the stock market,'' said
Janet Yellen, a former Fed governor and Clinton administration official.
Although total debt burdens are high, low interest rates have kept
monthly debt payments within reason. Debt-service payments as a
percentage of disposable income stood at a little over 14 percent in the
second quarter, about where they have been for the last several years,
though higher than they were in the mid-1980's.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Is the consumer extended? Absolutely,'' said James W. Paulsen,
chief investment officer for Wells Capital Management, an investment
firm. ''Is there a risk? Absolutely. But it's nothing new. All through
the 90's we pushed the problem of low savings and high debt out into the
future somewhere.''
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
BUT some economists say it is easy to envision a downward cycle in
which falling real estate values and heavy consumer debt drag the
economy into a morass, especially if unemployment shoots up and the
stock market stays down.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''We were in a euphoric or at least confident time in the 90's,''
said Robert J. Shiller, an economist at Yale University who was one of
the first to spot the stock market bubble. ''Now we're in an annoyed,
angry, betrayed mood. When bad things happen, they can get a lot of
attention.''

Housing Starts Jump 13.3%, Helping Lift The Economy
</span>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
With storms gathering elsewhere, the housing industry continues to
shield the economy during its halting recovery.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The number of houses that builders started working on jumped 13.3
percent last month, the biggest increase since 1995, the Census Bureau
said yesterday, as low interest rates spurred developers to try to
satisfy rising demand. The surge reversed a three-month streak of
declining housing starts that had raised some concern about whether
homebuilding would continue to add to overall economic activity.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Even as consumers have reduced their retail spending in recent weeks,
they appear confident enough to continue making large purchases,
analysts said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''If you have a job and want to buy a house, interest rates tell you
this is the best time to buy,'' said Chad Dreier, chief executive of the
Ryland Group, a homebuilding company, explaining the construction boom.
''There's just more demand than there is supply out there.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But the recent rise in mortgage rates may temper some of that demand
in the months ahead. At the same time, corporate executives still seem
to lack the confidence of consumers and remain committed to cutting
costs, according to other reports released yesterday.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Initial claims for jobless benefits rose to 411,000 last week, from
389,000 the previous week, according to the Labor Department's
seasonally adjusted numbers. Industrial production fell slightly last
month, its second straight decline, in a sign that manufacturers expect
growth to remain weak in coming months.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Investors seemed to focus on the more positive economic news and
indications of improving earnings, however, sending stock prices higher
and bonds lower. The Standard &amp; Poor 500-stock index rose 19.18, or more
than 2 percent, to close at 879.20.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
As strong as the housing market is, economists already see reasons to
think that it will not remain one the economy's biggest growth engines
in the coming year. Mortgage rates have jumped this week by the largest
increase in almost a year, as investors have become less fearful
recently of a double-dip recession. When investors are optimistic,
interest rates tend to rise, pushing bond prices down.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The average annual interest rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage rose to
6.23 percent, from 6.02, over the last week, according to BankRate.com,
a research company in North Palm Beach, Fla. On a $150,000 mortgage, the
difference equals $20 a month.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Housing is probably close to a peak,'' said James O'Sullivan, an
economist at UBS Warburg. ''Over the course of the next year, we'll have
decent enough growth that interest rates will climb and housing will
start to fade.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
That certainly has not happened yet, however. In September, builders
started construction on homes at an annual pace of 1.84 million, the
highest level since 1986, the Census Bureau said. Construction increased
the most in the Midwest and West.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
While starts of single-family homes soared, multifamily house
construction fell slightly, reflecting weakness in the rental market,
analysts said. The economic slowdown has left some renters with less
money to spend, and others have taken advantage of low interest rates to
buy their own homes.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The decline of stocks over the last two years has also made real
estate look like an increasingly attractive investment, causing some
people to spend more money on homes than they might have in the past.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The strong overall market suggests that consumers will continue to
spend heavily on many big-ticket items in the months ahead, when they
furnish the houses now being built. About two-thirds of houses in the
first stages of construction have already been sold, according to the
National Association of Home Builders.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Over the summer, Americans slightly increased their spending on home
remodeling, Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies said yesterday.
Over the last 12 months, households have spent about $115 billion on
remodeling.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
If interest rates were to rise only modestly, homebuying could remain
at a high level, since rates would still be lower than they had been for
much of the recent past. ''The interest rate thing is in our favor, even
if it rises a little bit,'' said Mr. Dreier, the housing executive.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But a small increase in rates would be more likely to cause a sharp
fall in the number of people refinancing their mortgages, that activity
has reached record levels in recent weeks. By reducing monthly housing
payments for millions of families and allowing many homeowners to move
money from their homes to their bank accounts, refinancings have helped
to offset the stock-market declines of the last three months and to keep
consumer spending strong.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Executives continue to be far more frugal than consumers, however, as
they have been throughout the last two years.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''My biggest concern is the timing and strength of the economic
recovery,'' said David J. O'Reilly, chief executive of ChevronTexaco.
''This has been a slower year than most people expected.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Weak retail spending and the potential war in Iraq, which could lead
to a spike in oil prices, have caused some companies to cut production.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The new report on jobless claims suggests that companies are doing
little new hiring, although layoffs are not as common as they were a
year ago. While new claims for unemployment insurance have fallen almost
13 percent since last October, the number of people receiving benefits
has risen 8 percent, to 3.48 million, according to the Labor Department,
which adjusts the number to account for normal seasonal variations.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The manufacturing sector looks especially weak. A survey of
executives in the Philadelphia area showed that manufacturing activity
there decreased more rapidly than it had in nearly a year, the Federal
Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
After a mild rebound in the first half of this year, Mr. O'Sullivan,
the UBS Warburg economist, said, ''it's pretty clear that manufacturing
has lost momentum.''

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
NEW YORK, Oct. 1 -- Manufacturing shrank in September for the first
time in eight months and construction spending dropped in August,
according to two reports released today, suggesting that the recovery is
running out of steam.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Institute for Supply Management said its index of business
activity declined to 49.5 in September, from 50.5 in August. Analysts
had been expecting a reading of 51. An index above 50 signifies growth
in manufacturing, while a figure below that shows contraction. The index
has not been below 50 since January.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Stagnant and sluggish are apt descriptions for manufacturing at
this time,'' said Norbert J. Ore, who oversees the monthly survey for
the institute, based in Tempe, Ariz.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The disappointing data came after reports a day earlier that showed
consumer spending, the primary driver of economic growth, had slowed in
August.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Economists had attributed the relative strength in manufacturing in
the first half of the year to a surge in inventory replenishment by
stores that had allowed shelves to go bare during the recession. Low
interest rates also encouraged consumer spending on cars and homes.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Economists worry, however, that Americans may begin cutting back
because of the weak stock market, concerns about job security and the
prospect of a war with Iraq.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In the second report, the Commerce Department reported today that
construction spending fell 0.4 percent in August. The downturn was
attributed to a reluctance by businesses to spend on new factories and
other buildings. The decline came after a 0.1 percent decrease in July.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Economists said the commercial construction continued to be the
source of weakness, reflecting reluctance by businesses to make big
commitments.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Another possible factor for sagging commercial construction, analysts
said, is the difficulty that some companies have been having in
obtaining terrorism insurance since last year's attacks.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Spending on all construction projects fell to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of $829.8 billion in August, representing a 0.4 percent
decline from the previous month.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
For all commercial projects by private builders, spending declined to
a rate of $159.2 billion in August, a 2 percent decrease from July.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
On the residential side, spending on housing projects dipped 0.2
percent in August to a rate of $407.5 billion.

New-Home Sales at a High; Big-Ticket Orders Fall Slightly

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON, Sept. 26 -- Orders to factories for big-ticket goods fell
much less than expected in August, while new-home sales hit a monthly
high, reports released today by the Commerce Department showed.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Orders for durable goods -- items expected to last at least three
years -- fell 0.6 percent, to $178.4 billion. The decline came after a
revised 8.6 percent increase the previous month and reflected slackened
demand for cars, communications equipment and machinery. Analysts had
expected a 3 percent drop in August.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Sales of new homes climbed to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
996,000 in August, a record, representing a 1.9 percent increase from
July.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
New-home sales in August were stronger than analysts had predicted.
Their forecast was for a drop of 3.6 percent.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A third report released by the Labor Department showed that new
claims for unemployment benefits dropped 24,000, to 406,000, an
encouraging sign for workers dealing with the lackluster job market.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Housing is one of the few bright spots in the economy. Low mortgage
rates are enticing buyers. And rising home values, especially given the
slumping stock market, make owning a house a good investment.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In August, the median price of a new home rose 1.6 percent from the
previous month to $175,300.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
By region, new-home sales in the West rose 7.4 percent in August, to
a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 276,000. In the South, sales went
up 1.3 percent, to a rate of 476,000. But in the Northeast, sales
dropped 9.5 percent, to a rate of 57,000. And in the Midwest, sales were
flat at a rate of 187,000.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In the manufacturing report, orders for automobiles fell 3.8 percent
in August after a sizable 8.4 percent rise in July. Although free
financing deals have lifted car sales, economists say production levels
were too brisk to be maintained.

Orders for communications equipment dropped 4 percent in August,
after a big 9.2 percent advance. Orders for computers dipped 1.4

Existing-Home Sales Off 1.7% In Slowing of a Record Pace
</span>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON, Sept. 25 -- Sales of existing homes fell 1.7 percent in
August, a national real estate trade association said today, as home
buying settled from record levels earlier in the year.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Sales of previously owned homes slid to a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of 5.28 million units from an upwardly revised 5.37 million pace in
July, the National Association of Realtors said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The August sales level fell short of the expectations of a pace of
5.4 million units.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''It's still a very healthy pace but certainly we are winding down
from the boom,'' the group's chief economist, David Lereah, said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But other analysts said the data showed signs that consumer
confidence was beginning to erode in the face of job pressures, tumbling
stock markets and the prospect of war with Iraq.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Even with low interest rates, if jobs and the economy stay weak,
and risks to balance sheets from the bad stock market and international
risks remain, I think we're going to see hesitation in buying big-ticket
items like homes,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist for Decision
Economics.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Home buying levels surpassed a 5.7 million sales pace in four of the
first five months of this year, but have been below the 5.4 million pace
for the last three months. Mr. Lereah said he expected home sales to hit
more than 5.4 million units for the year, breaking last year's record of
5.3 million.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Housing has been thriving even as much of the economy has stayed
lackluster in the aftermath of last year's recession. Buyers have taken
advantage of the lowest rates in over four decades to buy, refinance and
remodel homes.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Rates on the popular 30-year fixed-rate mortgage hit new lows this
week. The Mortgage Bankers Association said today that rates dipped to
5.85 percent, the lowest since the group began tracking rates in 1990.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The median house price rose to $163,600 in August from $162,500 the
preceding month, and was up 6.4 percent from August a year ago, the real
estate trade group said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Inventories also rose. There were 2.2 million homes available for
sale in August, or a 5-month supply at current sales rates, up from a
4.7-month supply in July.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Regionally, existing-home sales rose 2.2 percent in the West, but
fell 1.8 percent in the South, 5.9 percent in the Midwest and 1.6
percent in the Northeast.

Construction Spending Was Flat During July

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON, Sept. 4 -- Construction spending was flat in July, the
Commerce Department reported today, as an increase in government work
helped blunt cutbacks in private construction projects, which dropped to
the lowest level in nearly six years.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
After declining for two months, the level of construction spending in
July was unchanged at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $834.1
billion, the Commerce Department said. Analysts had expected a 0.4
percent drop.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
That report and more forward-looking data showing that manufacturing
barely grew in August point to a sputtering economic recovery,
economists said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In the construction market, the commercial sector continues to be a
source of weakness, reflecting reluctance by businesses to make big
commitments in capital spending -- including new factories and other
buildings -- given economic uncertainties, analysts said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Another possible factor for sagging commercial construction is
difficulties some companies are having in obtaining terrorism insurance
after Sept. 11, some economists said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Nonresidential building has been the weakest part of the
construction picture and a big victim of 9/11,'' said Clifford Waldman,
an economist with Waldman Associates.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Spending on all commercial projects by private builders fell 2.2
percent in July, to a rate of $162.1 billion, the lowest level since
September 1996. Spending on industrial complexes dropped 4.3 percent in
July to a rate of $15.5 billion, the lowest level since May 1978.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Spending on hotels and motels -- another segment still feeling the
lingering effects of the terror attacks -- dipped to a rate of $10
billion in July, the lowest level in six years. Spending on schools and
hospitals also declined. Spending on office buildings edged up 0.3
percent.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON, Aug. 26 -- Sales of new homes surged in July to the
highest monthly level on record, and sales of previously owned homes
also increased, two reports released today said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Sales of new homes climbed to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
1.02 million in July, a record monthly pace and a 6.7 percent increase
from June, the Commerce Department reported.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Sales of existing homes rebounded in July, rising 4.5 percent from
June, to a rate of 5.33 million units, according to the National
Association of Realtors.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Home sales have been a bright spot of the economy, mostly because of
low mortgage rates, which remain below levels of a year ago. Another
factor motivating buyers, economists said, is the appreciation in
housing values.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In July, those factors offset negative ones, including eroding
consumer confidence and a stagnant job market.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In June, sales of new homes fell 2.6 percent and existing-home sales
dropped 11.1 percent as worries about jobs, the stock market and the
economy seemed to weigh on prospective buyers. Even with the declines,
sales remained healthy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Both new-home and existing-home sales are expected to set records
this year. David Seiders, economist at the National Association of Home
Builders, predicted that new-home sales would reach 936,000. David
Lereah, economist for the National Association of Realtors, is
projecting existing-home sales to reach 5.44 million.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
By region, new-home sales in July increased 16 percent in the

Data Indicate U.S. Recovery Is Still Fragile
</span>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Consumer sentiment stabilized in early August after a summer stock
market rout, but housing starts slipped in July from lofty levels even
as mortgage rates fell, according to reports released yesterday. The
data point to a steady but still-fragile recovery.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Consumer inflation remained tame in July, a separate government
report said, leaving the Federal Reserve ample room to cut interest
rates should the recovery stall.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But for now, a halt in the slide in consumer sentiment provided some
hope that consumer spending would continue to aid an economy beset by
weak corporate profits, sluggish growth and a delay in job creation
after last year's recession.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Looking forward, consumers remain cautious in their outlook,'' said
Lynn Reaser, chief economist at Banc of America Capital Management in
St. Louis. ''But with consumer confidence stabilizing, income rising and
an improving stock market, consumers should be spending at a moderate
pace.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index edged
down to 87.9 in early August, compared with a final 88.1 in July,
holding at its lowest level since November. The drop was a bit lower
than consensus forecasts for a reading of 88.3.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Separately, housing starts fell for a second month in July but
remained at historically robust levels, down 2.7 percent, to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.649 million units, the Commerce
Department said. That came after a revised 2.7 percent drop in starts in
June, to a 1.695 million annual pace.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Consumer Price Index, the main United States inflation gauge,
rose just 0.1 percent last month after an identical advance in June, the
Labor Department said. Excluding food and energy prices, which can vary
widely from month to month, the core index was up 0.2 percent in July,
after a 0.1 percent climb in June.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
With inflation so tightly contained, economists say the Fed has room
to lower its benchmark federal funds rate, already at a four-decade low
of 1.75 percent, if it becomes necessary.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The summer's slide in consumer sentiment halted in early August as
Americans took heart from the stock market's recent recovery from
five-year lows in July and grew more upbeat about their current
finances. That offset pervasive worries about the economy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The steadying was driven entirely by a rise in the current-conditions
component, which tracks consumers' views about their present financial
situation.

The decline in housing starts in July, meanwhile, came after a strong
showing in the spring and early summer and was mostly expected given
that some builders would probably turn more cautious in light of the
stock market woes. Historically low interest rates have helped to spur
housing along for most of this year.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Housing starts were off only 0.9 percent from the 1.664 million
annual rate of a year ago. The June starts pace was also revised upward.
Housing permits, an indicator of planned future construction, were off
only slightly in July, dipping 0.5 percent, to a 1.698 million unit
annual rate.

Investment Clubs Are Zeroing In on Real Estate
</span>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
AT a recent club gathering at J J North's Grand Buffet, an
all-you-can-eat restaurant in Portland, Ore., dozens of people took
turns introducing themselves to the crowd of more than 100. ''Hi, my
name is Josh,'' one of them said nervously, ''and I just did my first
investment this week.'' Cheers erupted, and Josh Fuhrer, 28, a local
part-time actor, blushed with pride.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Fuhrer wasn't talking about just any investment. He and the
others in the group, many of them undoubtedly concerned about volatility
on Wall Street, are turning their attention instead to Main Street and
the physical assets that they can see, touch and drive by -- from studio
apartments to single-family homes to multi-unit apartment buildings. The
Northwest Real Estate Investors, as the Oregon group is called, meets
regularly, in almost support-group style, to trade tips and swap stories
about real estate investing in the Portland region.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Whether the club and others like it will reap long-term profits
remains to be seen. Nonetheless, the popularity of these groups has been
climbing rapidly.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
National figures are hard to come by, but real estate investment
clubs from New York City to Charlotte, N.C., to Portland say their ranks
are swelling. The National Real Estate Investors Association, which
offers services to clubs (www.nationalreia.com[http://www.nationalreia.com/]), estimates that there
are some 600 real estate investment groups nationwide, nearly double the
number just two years ago. Several have popped up recently in Arizona,
Ohio and Texas, for example.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Portland club was incorporated last August with 30 members; it
now has 160. Interest has been so strong that it has added two meetings
a month, bringing the total to three. The group has also had to book
larger meeting space, according to its president, Mark LaNore, a loan
officer at the Lighthouse Financial Group, a mortgage company in
Portland.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. LaNore and others say that now is a good time to invest in real
estate: demand is high and interest rates are low.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 6.43 percent
for the week ended Friday, according to Freddie Mac, a
government-sponsored buyer of home mortgages. That was up from 6.34
percent the week earlier, the lowest since the agency began tracking the
rate 31 years ago.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Sales of existing homes, meanwhile, have been brisk for much of the
year: they were running at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.1
million in June, and the National Association of Realtors is forecasting
record sales for the year. And new-home sales rose to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of one million in June, a record.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''There is more money chasing real estate than there is real
estate,'' Mr. LaNore said. ''It's nuts, but it's the game right now.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
That is where real estate investment clubs are supposed to help. The
clubs serve as an informal repository for available inventory. Buyers
and sellers announce at meetings what they are looking for or what they
have for sale. Then they trade business cards. Members can also attend
workshops and meet professionals -- lawyers, accountants and real estate
agents who can give free advice on deals.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Real estate clubs, of course, have been around for many years -- at
least as long as the phrase ''no money down,'' the pitch of late-night
TV real estate promoters who sell tapes, videos and books on how to
become a millionaire without sweating the equity. Most real estate
clubs, though, don't stump for such salesmen, preferring to let
inexperienced members learn the ropes by mingling with the more seasoned
members.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Nicholas Zampetti Jr. of Bogota, N.J., president of the Metropolitan
Real Estate Investors Association, says his club doesn't promote real
estate as a fast path to riches. ''Long term, the money is in holding on
to property, not flipping it,'' he said, referring to the practice of
buying and selling quickly for a profit.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
His group started during the 1985 real estate boom but lost
membership in the bull market for stocks of the 1990's. Now the club is
growing again. ''With the Dow down, we're seeing 25 new members a month,
Mr. Zampetti said. ''It used to be just about seven.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
ASK real estate club members what they like about investing in
property and they invariably cite its tangible nature. (Try kicking the
tires of a mutual fund, they say.) They also like the fact that they can
pick their property investments. A 401(k) plan portfolio is typically
limited to the offerings of a mutual fund company chosen by an employer.
As Enron employees have learned so painfully, an employer does not
always encourage diversification of the plan's holdings.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
As an investment, real estate has fared much better than the stock
market of late. An investment of $1,000 at the height of the stock
market in March 2000, would be worth $1,501 today if the money had been
put into real estate mutual funds, for example, compared with $639 if it
had been placed in a fund mimicking the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock
index, or $211 if invested in the Nasdaq composite, according to Lipper
Inc., the fund-tracking company.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Many financial advisers say real estate has a place in the average
investor's portfolio because of its relatively low volatility and
relatively high yield. But real estate assets can be what Michael Acton,
a pension fund adviser in Boston, calls ''lumpy,'' or illiquid.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Most individuals are probably not well served by going out and
investing in real estate,'' said Mr. Acton, director of research at AEW
Capital Management of Boston, which has about $7 billion in real estate
under management for pension funds and institutions.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
As an alternative, Mr. Acton advises people to consider publicly
traded real estate investment trusts, or REIT's, which invest in real
estate, from shopping malls to industrial parks.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
REIT's have done well so far this year. The average dividend yield is
about 6 percent, according to the National Association of Real Estate
Investment Trusts, while share prices have far surpassed those of
stocks.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Dennis R. Capozza, a professor of finance and real estate at the
University of Michigan School of Business in Ann Arbor, also urges
caution. Newcomers to real estate investing, he said, are likely to make
many of the same mistakes as novice stock investors: overpaying, selling
too quickly or holding too long, or simply being unable to obtain
crucial information as fast as those who are closer to the market.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''All the problems you have with amateurs in the stock market you
also have in real estate,'' Mr. Capozza said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Fuhrer, the actor from Portland, might once have agreed with such
an assessment, but he says his real estate club and the connections he
has made through it have helped him learn the ropes.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Fuhrer says he began studying real estate on his own a few years
ago and recently paid the $95 in annual dues to join Northwest Real
Estate Investors. After his first meeting, he said he took the leap. A
friend who is a real estate agent was looking for someone to buy assets
from a court-ordered dissolution of a partnership; the properties were
being sold at less than their market value to satisfy a judgment. Mr.
Fuhrer sensed a deal and told his friend that he could find an investor
to buy the undervalued assets for 80 cents on the dollar. He began
networking at the real estate club and met John E. Laine-Reinders, whose
company, Creative Capital Networks, buys discounted properties for
investors.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The two worked out a deal that gives Mr. Furher a finder's fee of 5
percent of the equity in each property for sale. Mr. Laine-Reinder's
investors will spruce up the properties and sell them at market value.
As many as 27 properties, mostly single-family homes, could be sold
under the deal over the next year. Mr. Fuhrer says he stands to make as
much as $80,000 over the coming year on the deal.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Investing in real estate doesn't just mean you have to buy
property. I'm not out any cash or credit,'' he said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
SOMETIMES club members pool money. Wesley Barney of Flushing, Queens,
president of the Ultimate Investors Real Estate Club, which started
about 15 years ago, said he recently joined with an accountant and a
roofer to buy a 12-unit apartment complex, whose owners were late on
payments, in Independence, Mo. He had learned of the property through
his real estate club contacts and approached the bank holding the
mortgage. His group negotiated a new loan and the bank avoided having to
categorize the original loan as a nonperforming asset. Mr. Barney's
group, meanwhile, now has a source of income.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Not every deal is as smooth. Kraig Mead, 42, of Milwaukie, Ore., who
arranges transportation for commercial shippers, said he found himself
in a jam when a fixer-upper house he bought two years ago turned out to
be a former illegal methamphetamine lab. Mr. Mead remodeled the home,
putting $20,000 into flooring, wallboard and carpeting. He moved in with
his family and started a home day care center. Then one day state health
officials showed up and declared the house a hazardous site. The day
care operation shut down and the Meads moved out. Mr. Mead, who is now
looking to sell the place, is liable for the cost of testing for
contamination and any resulting cleanup. He said he has been told that
the cost could range from $3,000 to $50,000. State officials must
certify the cleanup.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Don't forget that you are responsible,'' he advised club members at
a recent meeting, ''even if it wasn't your fault.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
What is his advice, in hindsight? Call state health and environmental
officials before buying anything to make sure that it is not on a list
of properties to be seized for cleanup.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Robert Mularz, 56, of Livingston, N.J., a credit manager for a
plastics company, also advises average investors not to expect to get
rich quick. ''I learned that it's very time-consuming and that you can
make mistakes,'' he said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
On the other hand, he advises newcomers not to fall victim to
''paralysis of analysis,'' or overanalyzing a deal.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Fear kept me from getting started for a long time,'' he said. ''Now
I'm sorry I didn't start sooner.''
</p>

Data Suggest Weak Spots In Economy

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON, July 25 -- Factory orders for big-ticket goods, including
cars and computers, unexpectedly fell 3.8 percent in June from May, the
largest amount in seven months, the Commerce Department reported today.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The June decline in orders for durable goods -- items expected to
last at least three years -- was the first since March and came after a
0.6 percent increase in May. Analysts had expected a 0.6 percent
increase.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Adding to concerns was a National Association of Realtors report
today that sales of existing homes -- the largest part of the housing
market -- dropped 11.7 percent in June from May. That left sales at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.1 million, the lowest in nine
months. Existing-home sales, however, have been running at brisk levels
for much of the year and the association is forecasting record sales for
2002.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Commerce Department, meanwhile, reported today that new-home
sales rose to a record seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1 million in
June, a 0.5 percent increase over May. Analysts had expected a 4.7
percent decline.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Many analysts think low mortgage rates will continue to support the
housing market, which in turn would help a recovery.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The decline in durable-goods orders along with a 1.4 percent drop in
shipments -- a barometer of current demand -- was considered an ominous
sign that businesses might be growing even more uncertain about a
recovery.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''The report suggests that there is an endemic concern about the
state of their own businesses, whether consumers will step up and buy
their products, and the prospects for the economy in general,'' said
Mark Zandi, chief economist for Economy.com.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The decline in orders was broad based. Orders for cars, computers,
communications equipment, machinery, metals, metal products and
electrical equipment all dropped.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''The glass remains half-empty for many manufacturers and the
recovery -- while well under way -- has not yet accelerated to a
satisfactory pace,'' David Huether, chief economist for the National
Association of Manufacturers, said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Two Labor Department reports released today offered workers some
encouraging news. Wages and benefits increased 1 percent in the quarter
from April to June from the previous quarter, the fastest pace in six
months. That came after a 0.8 percent advance in the first three months
of this year.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In addition, new claims for state unemployment insurance dropped to a
17-month low, suggesting that the pace of layoffs is stabilizing. Claims
fell last week by a seasonally adjusted 21,000, to 362,000.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON, July 17 -- Starts on new housing fell 3.6 percent in June
after a surge the previous month, the government said today, but
economists, including the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, said
housing remained at strong levels.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''There's no evidence that one can see that the fairly significant
strength in the housing market is in any way impeded,'' Mr. Greenspan
said at a House hearing on the economy, in response to a question about
the report.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Groundbreaking for new homes eased to a seasonally adjusted 1.672
million units a year from an upwardly revised rate of 1.735 million
units in May, the Commerce Department reported.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Starts were below the projections of analysts polled by Reuters, who
had forecast a 1.677 million unit rate.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Despite the decline in June, analysts noted that building and sales
activity remained at historically high levels.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Over the past 20 years, the level of single-family activity posted
in June was exceeded only three times. And two of those occasions
occurred this year,'' said Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Permits, an indication of future activity, rose 1.4 percent, to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.7 million.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Regionally, starts were mostly lower, falling 7.6 percent in the
South -- the busiest home-building region -- 2.2 percent in the West and
0.9 percent in the Midwest. Groundbreaking for new homes climbed 6.1
percent in the Northeast.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Another survey released today by the mortgage bankers trade
association showed that mortgage applications fell in the week ended
July 12, while refinancings rose as the national average on the 30-year
fixed-rate mortgage slid to almost 6.5 percent.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Although applications are also still at strong levels, the housing
market may not show the same levels of growth over the second half of
the year, said David Seiders of the National Association of Home
Builders.

Gauge of Manufacturing Higher; Construction at a 5-Month Low
</span>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON, July 1 -- Manufacturing, hobbled by last year's economic
slump, turned in its strongest performance in June in nearly two and a
half years, a report released today indicated. But another report, by
the Commerce Department, showed that construction spending in May
dropped to a five-month low.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Institute for Supply Management said its manufacturing index rose
to a level of 56.2 in June, the highest since February 2000 and up from
55.7 in May. A reading above 50 signifies growth in manufacturing, while
a figure below 50 shows contraction. It was the fifth month in a row
that manufacturing increased.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The factory index was stronger than the 55.5 reading many analysts
were forecasting. Economists were also encouraged by the institute's
production index, a gauge of current output, which rose to 61.4 in June,
the strongest showing in three years.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''The strength in manufacturing might offset some of the weaker
components of the economy like commercial construction and the
possibility that the consumer sector might soften,'' said Richard
Yamarone, an Argus Research economist.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But the Commerce Department said that construction spending in May
turned out to be weaker than expected. The value of all construction
projects dropped 0.7 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of
$852 billion, the lowest level since December. Analysts had expected a
0.3 percent increase. The decline followed a 0.4 percent rise in
construction spending in April.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
May's performance largely reflected a 3.1 percent drop in spending on
commercial projects, like office buildings and industrial complexes,
which fell to a pace of $173 billion, the department said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Spending on residential projects held steady. But commercial
construction has been lackluster as businesses withheld new investment
in plants and buildings. Economists said executives were unlikely to
step up such investment until they were more certain about a recovery.

the area hardest hit in the recent economic slump, showed signs of
improvement in May, with orders for durable goods rising 0.6 percent.
The advance in durable goods -- items expected to last at last three
years -- came after a 0.4 percent increase in April.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The housing market has been a bright spot in the slump, in large part
because of low mortgage rates. Also motivating buyers, economists say,
is the strong appreciation in housing values, especially as the stock
market has weakened.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Economists had forecast that new-home sales in May would rise 0.5
percent, to an annual pace of 920,000.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
By region, home sales jumped 26.4 percent in the Northeast, to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 67,000. In the South, sales rose 10.6
percent, to a pace of 482,000, and in the West, they were up 4.3
percent, to 289,000. Sales in the Midwest increased 2.7 percent, to an
annual 190,000.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In April, new-home sales rose 3.9 percent, according to revised
figures -- considerably stronger than the 1 percent rise previously
reported.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The 0.6 percent increase in new orders to factories in May was the
largest since a 1.7 percent advance in February, and represented the
fifth increase in six months.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The latest snapshot of manufacturing activity shows a sector of the
economy recovering after a long slump in which hundreds of thousands of
jobs were lost.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But yesterday's report and other manufacturing data suggest that this
rebound has limits. In part, the statistics reflect that businesses,
worried about the staying power of the broader economic recovery, seem
reluctant to make new investments in plants and equipment.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Shipments, a good barometer of current demand, were flat in May,
after a 3.4 percent jump in April. Factories reported that new orders
for fabricated metal products rose 2.4 percent in May, after a 1 percent
rise the month before.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Orders for computers and other electronic products rose 1 percent,

Consumer Confidence Declines; Home Sales Are Lower but Brisk
</span>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Americans' anxiety about corporate scandals and the job market sent
consumer confidence down to a four-month low in June, the Conference
Board reported yesterday.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The agency, an independent research group in New York, said its
consumer confidence index fell to 106.4 from a revised 110.3 in May, the
second-biggest drop since the attacks last September. Analysts had
expected a little worse -- a reading of 106.0.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In a separate report, the National Association of Realtors said sales
of existing homes declined in May, though the figure was still among the
highest levels on record.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''It's been a very difficult month for the financial markets,'' said
Gary Thayer, chief economist for A. G. Edwards &amp; Sons. Nevertheless, Mr.
Thayer said, ''consumers are still feeling better about things than they
did six, seven months ago.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Conference Board's index, based on a monthly survey of some 5,000
households, is closely watched because the level of confidence drives
consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of economic
activity. June's figure is the lowest since February, when consumer
confidence stood at 95.0 during Congressional hearings into the Enron
scandal. The drop from last month was also the largest since a drop of
11.7 points, to 85.3, in October, after the terrorist attacks.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Weak labor market conditions, generally soft business conditions
and waning public confidence in questionable business practices have
helped erode consumer confidence,'' said Lynn Franco, director of the
Conference Board's research center.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Respondents reporting that jobs were ''hard to get'' increased to
23.1 percent, from 21.8 percent in May. Those saying that jobs were
plentiful decreased to 20.1 percent, from 21.2 percent. The estimate of
job prospects in the next six months weakened.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In their report, the Realtors said sales of existing homes edged down
0.3 percent in May, to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 5.75
million. Even with the drop, sales in May were considered brisk and the
fourth highest in a month since the association began keeping records in
1968.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Housing is continuing to be a significant factor in sustaining the
U.S. economy,'' the association's chief economist, David Lereah, said.
''Going forward, the trend should be a gradual decline in home sales
activity, but they'll stay above last year's record.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In 2001, a record 5.3 million existing homes were sold. The
association expects sales figures this year to surpass that.

Consumer Expectations Ebb; Other Economic Gauges Rise

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Consumer confidence edged higher in May, but the expectations of
Americans fell for a second month, a business research report said
yesterday, providing further suggestions that the recovery is likely to
slow in coming months.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Commerce Department, in a separate report, said that consumer
spending rose for a fifth consecutive month in April.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
And the National Association of Realtors reported that the sales of
existing homes surged 7 percent in April.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Over all, economists said, the reports suggested that consumers were
likely to keep supporting the economy until businesses begin investing
and hiring again.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''The bottom line is that consumers still see economic conditions
getting better, but the degree of improvement is less than they saw
earlier in the year,'' said Mark Vitner, senior economist at Wachovia
Securities in Charlotte, N.C.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The research group, the Conference Board, said its index of consumer
confidence rose to 109.8 in May from 108.5 in April, which had been
revised downward. The index was mostly in line with forecasts of a
slight increase to 109.0, but below the 110.7 in March.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Confidence edged up, the board said, as Americans expressed optimism
about the economy's recovery and the labor market.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But it was the decline in the expectations index, a gauge of
consumers' outlook for the next six months, that some economists focused
on. The expectations index fell for a second month, to 109.4 in May from
109.6 in April. ''This mediocre showing for the view of the future is
somewhat disturbing'' said Drew Matus, an economist at Lehman Brothers,
''as it suggests that the consumer may be tiring and that the current
rate of consumption is being inflated by low interest rates.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In its report, the Commerce Department said that consumer spending
rose 0.5 percent in April, to a $7.32 trillion annual pace, after
gaining 0.3 percent in March. Spending on durable goods -- items
intended to last three years or more, like cars and appliances -- rose
1.4 percent.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Consumer spending is expected to remain close to the 3.2 percent pace
of growth posted in the first quarter, giving businesses leeway to start
to increase their capital investment, some economists said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Personal income grew 0.3 percent in April, matching analysts'
expectations, compared with a 0.4 percent increase in March.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">

homes surged 7 percent last month, to a seasonally adjusted annual pace

Japan's Central Bank Paints A Brighter Economic Picture
</span>
</div><div class="author">
By KEN BELSON
</div><div>522 words</div><div>1 May 2002</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Page 1, Column 1</div><div>English</div><div>

</div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
TOKYO, April 30 -- Mirroring the growing view that Japan will emerge
from recession later this year, the Bank of Japan upgraded its economic
forecasts today in one of its twice-yearly reviews. But it gave no sign
of abandoning its ultraloose monetary policy, with short-term interest
rates effectively at zero.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The central bank said today that it now expected Japan's $4.1
trillion economy, the second-largest after the United States, to
contract by about 0.5 percent in the fiscal year that began April 1. It
had previously predicted a 1 percent contraction.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The bank also saw chinks of light in the heavy overcast of deflation,
which has plagued the country and undermined revival efforts in recent
years. The bank's policy board said that even though wholesale and
consumer prices would fall this year, they would do so more gradually.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The policy board, which left monetary policy unchanged at its meeting
today, said that Japanese exports and industrial production were picking
up, and with them the outlook for corporate profits. But growing
competition and the costs of writing off bad loans will continue to
depress job creation, wages and prices, limiting consumer spending and
any chance for a full-blown recovery.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Japan's economy is expected to stop deteriorating toward the latter
half of the fiscal year and turn upward again, though it is not likely
to gain much upward momentum, the bank said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Delays in disposing of nonperforming loans will hamstring the
economy, the central bank said. The country's commercial banks have been
curtailing their lending despite vanishingly low interest rates because
they are reluctant to take on new risks. This caution has stunted
investment and growth, the bank said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Still, with the economy now out of any immediate danger of collapse
-- and with a few private economists even predicting modest growth this
year -- the bank is unlikely to repeat its performance of the last year,
when it eased monetary policy, one way or another, seven times. The
central bank is more likely to take small incremental steps, like
increasing the amount of money it leaves in the markets overnight,
rather than turning to unconventional measures like huge purchases of
foreign bonds, analysts said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Because of the cyclical recovery,'' said Mikihiro Matsuoka, an
economist at Deutsche Securities in Tokyo, ''the bank can make some
excuse of not loosening policy like in the past.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Signs of that recovery, driven largely by increasing demand overseas,
were visible on Monday, when the government reported a 0.5 percent
month-to-month gain in industrial output in March. Output also rose 1.2
percent in February. The economy had not posted consecutive monthly
gains in almost two years.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But new statistics today showed that domestic demand remained anemic.
Construction orders for March were 12.9 percent lower than in March
2001, and housing starts fell 6.3 percent from a year ago. And crude oil
imports -- Japan must import nearly all of its energy -- were down 6.4
percent from a year before.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON, April 25 -- The Labor Department reported today that its
employment cost index rose 0.8 percent in the first three months of the
year.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The index -- a broad measure of changes in workers' compensation --
was down from a seasonally adjusted 1 percent rise in the previous
quarter.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The first-quarter increase in compensation was the smallest since a
0.4 percent gain posted in the first quarter of 1999.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Employers aren't sure whether this recovery is for real and whether
it will last,'' said Clifford Waldman, an economist at Waldman
Associates. ''Until they are confident that it is here to stay, they are
not going to make big commitments in hiring or investing in projects and
they are not going to really boost compensation.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The wages and salaries component of the index grew 0.8 percent in the
first quarter, slightly slower than the 0.9 percent rise in the fourth
quarter of 2001.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A second Labor Department report today showed that fewer Americans
filed new claims for jobless benefits last week. Claims fell a
seasonally adjusted 31,000, to 421,000, the lowest level in a month.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The more stable four-week moving average of new claims, which smooths
out week-to-week fluctuations, rose last week to 452,500, the highest
level since early November.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A requirement that laid-off workers seeking to take advantage of a
federal extension for benefits must submit new claims caused a
distortion.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The number of workers continuing to receive unemployment benefits,
however, dipped to 3.7 million for the workweek ended April 13. That
encouraged some economists.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In a third report, sales of previously owned homes, coming off the
two highest months on record, fell 8.3 percent in March, to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 5.40 million, which is still a robust level of
activity, the National Association of Realtors reported. The level of
sales in March was the sixth strongest on record.

Economy's Rock: Homes, Homes, Homes

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Amid the shaky economy of the last couple of years, housing has
emerged as the central pillar of support. The market for housing has
become less volatile and less prone to oversupply than before; it has
also become the Federal Reserve's main lever for reviving the economy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Housing has been a key stabilizer,'' said Robert V. DiClemente,
chief United States economist at Salomon Smith Barney.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
From the very beginning of the downturn last year, the housing market
has been strong. And that remains true today. In February, sales of new
homes grew 5.3 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 875,000,
thanks to good weather and low mortgage rates. Sales of existing homes
in February fell only slightly from the record annual pace in January of
6.05 million.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Housing prices have been increasing faster than general inflation for
several years, and they have accelerated in recent months to their
fastest real rate of gain in decades.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
All this has bolstered consumer spending and helped salve the wounds
that the falling stock market inflicted on households.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In trying to explain the resilience of the housing market in the face
of rising unemployment, shrinking stock portfolios and a soft economy,
economists start with the Federal Reserve. The Fed's sharp cuts in
short-term interest rates supported the demand for housing by helping to
push mortgage rates down further.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mortgage rates had already started to fall in late 2000. ''The Fed
began cutting interest rates aggressively back in January of 2001,''
said S. Lawrence Yun, a senior economist at the National Association of
Realtors in Washington. ''The long-term rates pretty much anticipated
that move. By that time, mortgage rates had already hit 7 percent.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
With help from the Fed all through 2001, rates moved even lower for a
time. ''Last year mortgage rates were the second lowest on record,'' Dr.
Yun said. According to his calculations, the additional drop in mortgage
rates meant that three million more households could afford to pay a
mortgage on a new home.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''That's a big cushion'' for the housing market, he said, enough to
largely allay the effects of more than a million job losses last year.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
At the Fed, top officials were clearly aware of the importance of the
housing market in countering Wall Street's fall. Alan Greenspan, the Fed
chairman, told monetary policy experts at a forum in Jackson Hole, Wyo.,
last summer: ''Movements in the prices of some other assets in the
economy -- changes in house prices, for example -- have been steadier,
less dramatic, but perhaps no less significant.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The strong housing sector supported the economy in two ways. First,
it added $2 trillion to $3 trillion to homeowners' wealth, according to
calculations by Karl E. Case, a professor of economics at Wellesley
College and a co-author of ''Comparing Wealth Effects: The Stock Market
Versus the Housing Market,'' with John M. Quigley of the University of
California at Berkeley and Robert J. Shiller of Yale University. This
greater wealth from their real estate holdings encouraged consumers to
spend more, Professor Case said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Second, the rise in housing wealth -- combined with low interest
rates -- made last year an especially tempting time to refinance a
mortgage and arrange for home-equity loans and lines of credit, which
are often priced these days as low as the prime rate.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''People took advantage of the lower rates not just to lower their
debt service but to take out equity to support a lifestyle,'' Mr.
DiClemente said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Was taking on more debt dangerous in the midst of record levels of
outstanding consumer credit? Not according to Mr. DiClemente. The debt
that is reflected in home equity loans, he said, ''is pitted against the
most durable type of asset that people have.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
As it turned out, the housing market responded so well to the lower
rates that it became the main area of the economy where the Fed's
actions really gained traction last year. By contrast, business
investment continued to shrink despite the decline in interest rates
because companies found themselves with so much excess capacity that it
made little sense to try to expand.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''The only place where the Fed seems to have had a major impact is in
the housing sector,'' said Robert E. Litan, director of economic studies
at the Brookings Institution. And other traditional channels for the
effects of monetary policy, like exports and the stock market, did not
work much at all.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In the past, the housing market's strong reaction to changes in
interest rates sometimes led to nasty surprises, usually a glut followed
by a crash after rates increased or credit dried up. That happened as
recently as the late 1980's and the early 1990's. But despite its
healthy response to the Fed's rate cuts, the housing market is not as
volatile as it once was, economists now say.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Go back to the 1980's and you can see a case study of excess in
real estate,'' Mr. DiClemente said. ''In that case we had major
adjustments that held consumers and business back for years.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
This time appears to be different, said Dennis R. Capozza, a
professor of real estate finance at the University of Michigan. ''The
experience of the late 80's and early 90's was not wasted on people,''
he said. ''Builders have not responded as aggressively as they have in
the past. There hasn't been the oversupply that is typical in this kind
of cycle.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Dr. Yun agreed. ''The market is much better at anticipating whether
or not they are supplying too much,'' he said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In addition to lessons of the past, changes in regulations and real
estate finance have helped the housing market to achieve greater
stability. Among those were the easing of restrictions on the rates
banks could pay on deposits and the introduction of flexible mortgage
rates to fit consumers' needs.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The securitization of mortgages through the last few decades, which
led to bundles of mortgages being traded on financial markets, also made
credit for housing easier to attain. These changes have ''gradually
taken away a major element of cyclicality,'' in the economy, Mr.
DiClemente said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Even before these changes, the housing market was not like other
markets when it came to handling transitory drops in demand.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''The housing market behaves a little differently from other markets
on the downside,'' Professor Case said. ''When most markets feel a fall
in demand, price falls. The housing market doesn't behave that way, in
the short run anyway, because sellers hold out. People won't sell.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Professor Case added that surveys of homeowners show that those who
are selling their houses believe they can ride out troubled times in the
economy. ''If people view it as temporary,'' he explained, ''they're not
going to cut their asking prices.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A long-term trend has also been supporting the demand for housing:
the growing number of households.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Average household size has been falling for some time,'' Professor
Capozza said. ''The kids move out and get their own apartments. Young
college students and new workers, instead of joining up with other
similar people and sharing a house, will just get their own when their
incomes will support it.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
That is contrary to recent anecdotal evidence of hordes of laid-off
technology workers moving back in with their parents rather than buying
their own homes.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''You can infer what's going on in household formation by the fact
that people keep buying the darn things,'' said Edward F. McKelvey, a
senior economist at Goldman, Sachs.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Most economists expect the housing market to stay strong in the
coming year, though not as buoyant as in the last five years. Professor
Rosen said that rising interest rates, in expectation of
credit-tightening by the Fed, could slow the pace of increase in home
prices. He expects the level of housing construction and new-home sales
to drop about 15 percent by the end of the year and annual gains in
house prices to moderate from about 7 percent to roughly 4 percent.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Virtually no one, however, calls the current housing market a bubble,
in part because there is very little of the excess supply of unsold
homes so common in past economic recessions.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''The rise in housing prices,'' Mr. DiClemente said, ''just pales in
terms of what a real housing bubble looks like.''

Sales of New Homes Rise in Much of the U.S.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON, March 27 -- Good weather motivated people to house hunt
and favorable financing moved them to lock in deals, spurring a solid
increase in new-home sales in February.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Commerce Department reported today that sales of new
single-family homes last month came to a seasonally adjusted annual pace
of 875,000, a 5.3 percent increase over January's level.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Buying a house is often followed by significant spending in areas
like furniture and appliances. Given that, economists are optimistic
that consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of all economic
activity in the United States, will hold up fairly well in coming months
and speed national economic recovery.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''There's a tremendous multiplier effect of buying a home,'' said
Richard Yamarone, an economist at Argus Research. ''Step 1 is buying a
home. Steps 2 through 5 are putting things in it and redecorating.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
By region, new-home sales rose 9.9 percent in the South, to a
seasonally adjusted annual pace of 410,000 in February. In the West,
sales went up 6.7 percent, to a 240,000 pace. But Northeast sales fell
10.1 percent, to a pace of 62,000, and in the Midwest, sales dipped 0.6
percent, to an annual 163,000.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Economists cited low mortgage rates, good weather, increases in home
values and generally good consumer attitudes for helping to lift home
sales over all.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The median price of a new home fell 2.4 percent in February from
January, to $179,600, but rose about 6 percent from the month a year
earlier.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage in
February was 6.89 percent, down from 7 percent in January, according to
Freddie Mac, the mortgage company. But mortgage rates, as tracked by
Freddie Mac, have climbed in the last three weeks. The average rate on a
30-year loan rose last week to 7.14 percent.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In January, new-home sales plunged 15.8 percent, a drop that many
economists called a fluke and were hard pressed to explain. At the same
time, sales of previously owned homes soared to a record. .
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Early this week, the National Association of Realtors reported that
sales of previously owned homes dipped 2.8 percent in February. Still,
the annual pace of 5.88 million homes sold was the second-highest
monthly level on record.

Sales of Existing Homes Fell a Bit in February but Remain Strong

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON, March 25 -- Sales of existing homes fell slightly in
February but still posted the second-best annual rate ever, showing that
the housing sector remains on firm footing, a national real estate trade
association said today.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Sales of previously owned homes, the largest category of home sales,
declined 2.8 percent last month, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
5.88 million, the National Association of Realtors said. The January
sales rate was revised upward, to a record 6.05 million.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
February's pace exceeded the forecasts of analysts, who on average
had expected an annual sales rate of 5.52 million. Housing activity has
remained vigorous throughout the economic slump that started a year ago.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Median house prices were down a statistically insignificant amount
last month, to $150,000 from $150,300 in January, but were up 8.2
percent from the month a year earlier. Housing economists say the
year-over-year comparison is a more accurate view of the trend.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Regionally, sales climbed 1.4 percent in the Northeast but fell in
the three other major regions: down 4.2 percent in the South, the region
of the greatest number of sales; down 3.7 percent in the West; and down
0.8 percent in the Midwest.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Inventories were lean, unchanged at 4.2 months' supply of homes
available at current sales rates.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Strong fundamentals -- low mortgage rates, tight supply and resilient
consumer demand -- are bolstering the housing market, said David Lereah,
the chief economist for the association. Mild winter weather also
encouraged home buyers, he said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Rising interest rates, a likely consequence as the economy expands,
may damp housing a bit, but analysts said there was little evidence that
consumers would lose much appetite for building or buying homes.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Rates have backed up a little, but again, rates are around 7
percent, which means they're quite low by historic terms, so there's no
sign the housing market is coming to an untimely end,'' said Wayne
Ayers, chief economist for FleetBoston.

Housing Starts Rise To Three-Year High, Bolstering Economy

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON, March 20 -- Housing starts rose in February to the
highest level in more than three years, government figures showed today,
suggesting that the construction of new homes will underpin a rebounding
economy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
At an annual pace, builders began work on 1.769 million homes last
month, up 2.8 percent from a 1.721 million rate in January, the Commerce
Department said. That is the most homes started since December 1998 and
reflects the fastest pace of single-family housing construction in more
than 23 years.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''America wants to buy a home,'' said Stuart Miller, the chief
executive of the Lennar Corporation, the large home builder. ''As the
economy remains, within a range, fairly strong, as interest rates remain
historically low, I think the consumer continues to make the decision to
own a home.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The report suggests that the economy's recovery will be stronger than
expected and may prompt Federal Reserve policy makers to raise interest
rates by midyear.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The 30-year mortgage rate rose to 7.08 percent last week, according
to Freddie Mac, the large buyer of mortgages. Rates may keep rising
after Fed officials indicated on Tuesday that they had dropped their
15-month-old view that weak growth was the biggest threat to the
economy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Rising interest rates will not necessarily choke off the housing
market. A record number of houses were sold last year -- in the first
recession in a decade -- as 30-year mortgage rates averaged 6.97
percent. That was down from 8.05 percent in 2000, the third-best year
for combined new and sales of existing homes in history.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Analysts had expected housing starts to fall from a previously
reported rate of 1.678 million units in January.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Starts of single-family homes, which account for about 8 of 10 houses
being constructed, increased 7.4 percent in February, to a rate of 1.457
million units. That is the fastest since December 1978, Commerce
Department officials said. February starts of multifamily homes, like
apartment buildings and town houses, dropped 14.3 percent, to a 312,000
annual rate.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Building permits, an indicator of future construction, increased 1.8
percent, to 1.752 million units at an annual rate, the fastest in a
year, after rising 4.1 percent the previous month.

Orders Rose For Durables In January

WASHINGTON, Feb. 27 -- Orders for big-ticket items rose in January
for the third time in the last four months, while sales of new homes
fell to the lowest level in one and a half years, the government said
today, signaling that the economy is slowly gaining strength.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''This is shaping up to be an anemic recovery'' from the recession
that began last March, said Paul Kasriel, senior economist at Northern
Trust Securities in Chicago.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Commerce Department said today that orders for large, expensive
items, known as durable goods, rose 2.6 percent, reflecting more demand
for autos, aircraft and computers. Excluding transportation, orders rose
1.3 percent.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Sales of single-family homes slumped 14.8 percent last month, to
823,000 units at an annual rate, the slowest since June 2000, the
Commerce Department said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The sales fell from a revised pace of 966,000 houses in December. The
decrease was the largest since January 1994, and it suggests that
housing will be hard-pressed to repeat the record performance of last
year.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Earlier this week, the National Association of Realtors reported that
sales of previously owned homes surged last month to a record 6.04
million units at an annual rate.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
New-home sales are considered a more current gauge of the housing
market because they are based on contracts, while existing-home sales
are based on closings and reflect buying decisions that occurred at
least a month earlier.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
New-home sales fell in the South, West and Midwest. They rose in the
Northeast.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The median price of new homes rose 5.7 percent in January, to
$183,400 from $173,500 the previous month.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Prices were up 7.1 percent from the January of last year.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A rebound in demand for durable goods -- products like appliances,
semiconductors and cars that are intended to last more than three years
-- that started a month after the terrorist attacks suggests factories
are starting to emerge from a  contraction that began in August 2000.
Orders rose 0.9 percent in December.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The report also showed inventories of durable goods fell 0.6 percent
in January, the smallest decrease since April of last year. That is a

Plan to Cut Construction Spending Would Delay Willis Avenue and Brooklyn
Bridge Projects
</span>
</div><div class="author">

</div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A plan to replace the 101-year-old Willis Avenue Bridge, which
connects the Bronx and Manhattan, is being delayed as part of the
Bloomberg administration's plan to cut spending on capital construction
projects by 25 percent, officials said yesterday.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
So is a plan to reduce traffic congestion by building a new $200
million ramp connecting the Brooklyn Bridge to the southbound Franklin
D. Roosevelt drive.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The decision to push the two projects back came to light yesterday as
details began to emerge of the administration's plan to cut its capital
budget for the next few years by 20 percent, or $25.6 billion. Since
most of the city's capital budget is paid for with borrowed money,
delaying big projects will save the city money on its debt service, or
the regular payments it must make on the money it borrowed.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Although Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has proposed cutting the overall
capital budget by 20 percent, some areas will be cut much more and some
less, and some will grow.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Willis Avenue Bridge project and the Brooklyn Bridge ramp project
are part of the city's waterway bridges program, which is being cut by
43 percent.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Tom Cocola, a spokesman for the Department of Transportation, said
the $350 million Willis Avenue Bridge project was being pushed back to
2007 from 2006. He noted that the city has been refurbishing several
other bridges along the Harlem River, including the Macombs Dam Bridge
and the Madison Avenue Bridge.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Cocola said that other important bridge projects, including the
next phases of work on the Williamsburg Bridge and the Manhattan Bridge,
will go forward.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Other departments whose capital budgets are being cut by more than 20
percent in the plan for the years 2002 through 2005 include the parks
department, which is being cut 25 percent; cultural institutions, which
are being cut 27 percent; and the New York Public Library, which is
being cut 37 percent.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Board of Education, which is being cut by nearly 22 percent, is
losing the most money: more than $1 billion. Officials there have said
that the cut will mean holding off on the construction of eight or nine
schools in the coming years.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Some agencies are seeing their capital budgets increased under the
plan: money for New York City Transit is going up slightly, as is money
for ferries.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The capital budget for the Department of Information Technology and
Telecommunications is being raised the most, by $34.7 million. During
his campaign, Mr. Bloomberg often spoke about making the city more
efficient through technology.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
As more details of Mr. Bloomberg's budget plan emerge, and as the
mayor and the City Council begin what promises to be months of
negotiations over how to close the $4.76 billion gap, one issue is
emerging as particularly divisive: new taxes.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The mayor has made it clear that he adamantly opposes raising taxes,
except for making the cigarette tax $1.50 a pack to discourage smoking.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Council, however, has made it clear that it is concerned by some
proposed service cuts and that it wants to discuss possible tax
increases among the options for balancing the budget. ''I understand
that the mayor feels that no new taxes other than the taxes he has
proposed should be on the table,'' said Gifford Miller, the Council
speaker, ''and that's not our position.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Bloomberg, for his part, reiterated his stance yesterday. ''I
think my position is clear,'' he said. ''I think that at this point in
time, it would not be advisable to raise taxes. You do not want to give
people reasons to leave or not come to New York City.''

Sales for the entire year were 900,000 units, 2.6 percent above the
877,000 for 2000. The annual figure is the highest since the government

Home Resales Fell in December, but the Yearly Total Set a Record

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON, Jan 25 -- Sales of existing homes fell 0.8 percent in
December, although total sales in 2001 were a record 5.251 million
units, a trade association said today.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Previously owned homes, the largest category of home sales, sold at a
seasonally adjusted annualized pace of 5.19 million units last month,
down from a revised rate of 5.23 million in November, the trade group,
the National Association of Realtors, said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The total for the year eclipses the previous record of 5.205 million
homes sold in 1999.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In December, the pace of house sales fell short of the expectations
of analysts, who forecast a rate of 5.2 million home sales. A slight
increase in mortgage rates in December was a factor, said David Lereah,
chief economist of the association.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''The reason for the record, as we've been saying all along, is great
fundamentals in the housing market,'' Mr. Lereah said. Those factors
include low long-term mortgage interest rates and a lean inventory of
homes for sale, he said. Mr. Lereah expects 2002 will be the third-best
year on record.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Previously owned homes account for 85 percent of all houses sold and
are considered an important gauge of consumer demand.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Housing is ''being driven by historically low mortgage rates and,
despite what people say about unemployment, 95 percent of the people are
still employed,'' Daryl Jesperson, president of RE/MAX International,
told Bloomberg News.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
By region, existing-home sales fell 1.6 percent in the Northeast, to
a 630,000-unit pace, and dropped 2.4 percent in the South, to a 2
million-unit rate. Sales increased 0.9 percent in the Midwest, to a rate
of 1.18 million units, and rose 0.7 percent in the West, to a 1.38
million-unit rate.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Low mortgage rates have ''provided considerable support'' to home-
building and sales in recent months, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the
Federal Reserve, told the Senate Budget Committee this week. While they
have started to rise again, ''mortgage rates remain at low levels and
should continue to provide support to activity in this sector,'' he
said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The national median home price rose to $151,400 in December from
$147,100 in November, and was $147,500 for the year as a whole.
Inventories fell to a 4.2 months' supply of homes available at the
current sales pace, down from a 4.8 months' supply in November.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON, Dec. 18 -- Home builders broke ground last month on the
largest number of projects since July as low mortgage rates and mild
weather helped the housing market remain a bright spot in the economy,
the Commerce Department reported today.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
It said that housing construction rose to a seasonally adjusted
annual pace of 1.65 million housing units in November, an 8.2 percent
increase from figures in October.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The rise was the biggest one-month gain since January and pushed
housing starts to the highest level since July, when they reached an
annual pace of 1.66 million units.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
November's rebound came after housing starts fell by a revised 4
percent in October, a larger drop than the government previously
reported.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The stronger-than-expected performance came even with consumer
confidence at a seven-and-a-half-year low, unemployment worsening to 5.7
percent and payrolls falling.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Low mortgage rates are a crucial reason that the housing and
construction markets have remained stable as the national economy is in
recession.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The average interest rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage was 6.7
percent in November, compared with 7.7 percent a year earlier. Early in
November, the mortgage company Freddie Mac reported, 30-year fixed-rate
mortgages dipped to 6.45 percent, near a record low in 30 years of
record-keeping. They have since risen, to 7.09 percent last week.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Home buyers likely rushed to take advantage of low rates before
they moved higher,'' said Karen Dexter, an economist at Merrill Lynch.
''Warm weather also contributed to the jump.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The construction of single-family homes rose 3.2 percent in November,
to an annual pace of 1.26 million units, after a 3.4 percent decline the
month before. The building of apartments, condominiums and other such
housing soared by 30.1 percent last month, to an annual 346,000, after a
2.9 percent drop in October.

Confidence Index Drops, but Housing Sales Rise

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON, Nov. 27 -- Consumer confidence unexpectedly slumped this
month, but housing was a surprise bright spot in the economy in October,
reports showed today.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Conference Board reported that its index of consumer confidence
fell to 82.2 this month from 85.3 in October as Americans' assessment of
current conditions declined. It was the lowest level in seven and a half
years.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In housing, sales of existing homes surged a larger-than-expected 5.5
percent in October, to an annual pace of 5.17 million units from a 4.9
million rate in September, the National Association of Realtors said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Brian Bruce, who manages $4 billion as director of global investments
at PanAgora Asset Management in Boston, struck a somewhat optimistic
note, noting that home and auto sales are up. ''Consumers are most glum
before the economy turns around,'' he said. ''Things aren't as bad as
the consumer confidence index suggests.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Moreover, consumer expectations for the next six months rose, the
Conference Board reported. Retailers like Kmart said sales improved last
week. And the 30-year mortgage rate is close to a record low. That is
setting the stage for a gradual rebound from the first recession in a
decade.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Federal Reserve policy makers ''expect the recovery to improve next
year, although the timing is uncertain,'' Michael Moskow, the president
of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said today. ''Confidence will be
an important factor.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Measures of sentiment have been mixed. The Conference Board's index
of current conditions fell to 93.5, in November from 107.2. The index
measuring consumers' six-month outlook rose to 74.6, from 70.7.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Most economists were surprised in the decline in the overall index.
They had expected an increase to 86.5.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Home sales have been supported by falling mortgage rates. The average
rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage has stayed below 7 percent for three
months, the longest stretch on record below that level.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The 30-year rate fell to a record 6.45 percent this month, according
to Freddie Mac, which buys mortgages. The average principal and interest
payment on a $100,000 mortgage at that rate would be $628.78 a month.
That compared with an average $778.86 in May 2000.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The National Association of Realtors said it expected 5.19 million
existing homes would be sold this year, second only to 1999, when 5.21
million homes were sold.

Drop in Housing Construction, At 1.3%, Is Below Expectations
</span>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON, Nov. 19 -- Starts of new housing fell less than expected
in October, the government said today in a report that suggested the
home construction industry continued to buttress the economy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Work began last month on 1.552 million houses at an annual rate, down
1.3 percent from 1.572 million in September, the Commerce Department
said. The decline in starts of single-family houses and multifamily
units like apartment buildings was less than the 4.7 percent drop that
analysts had expected.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
While sales have declined in recent months, builders are counting on
30-year fixed mortgage rates that are close to a record low to underpin
the industry.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The housing market ''is reflective of the general economy, where
conditions have decelerated but not gone into the tank,'' said Joel
Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pa.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Building permits, an indicator of future construction, fell 3.6
percent last month to the lowest level since December 1997, the
government said. New-home sales fell in September to the lowest level in
a year, the Commerce Department said last  month. And mortgage
applications for home purchases fell to the lowest level this year at
the end of October, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association of
America.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
That suggests new construction will cool in the months ahead. Housing
starts will average 1.44 million units at an annual rate from October
through December, down 10 percent from the 1.594 million average in the
third quarter, David Seiders, chief economist for the National
Association of Home Builders, said last week.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Starts of single-family homes fell 1.2 percent in October, to a rate
of 1.242 million units, today's report showed. October starts of
multifamily homes, including apartments and town houses, dropped 1.6
percent, to an annual rate of 310,000 units. Housing completions rose
1.3 percent.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
New-home construction is likely to total 1.6 million units this year.
That would exceed the 1.57 million started in 2000. Starts totaled 1.64
million in 1999, the strongest year for starts since 1986.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Lower mortgage rates help explain why an index of optimism among
builders rose this month. The housing market index of the National
Association of Home Builders' was up to 49 this month from 47 in
October.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage was at a record low of
6.45 percent in the week ended Nov. 9, according to statistics from
Freddie Mac, the No. 2 buyer of mortgages. The rate averaged 8.05
percent last year.

Home Sales Have Been Generally Strong in October

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
CONTRADICTORY, complex, as hard to analyze as Tony Soprano on or off
Prozac, the New Jersey residential market stumbled hard immediately
after the Sept. 11 attack, but has since revived. At least in some
towns. At least for now.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Your ball is as good as my ball,'' Jean Olcott of Burgdorff ERA,
who has been a sales agent in Bergen County for 29 years,  said with a
laugh. It is hard to be a swami in never-before-seen circumstances, she
pointed out.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Sept. 11 attack in Manhattan did have an immediate measurable
impact in New Jersey. The number of sales contracts signed for homes was
off 16 percent in September, compared with September 2000, according to
the Garden State Multiple Listing Service, which has 555 member
companies in eight counties.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Coldwell Banker, a brokerage that does business in those eight
counties and four others, experienced a 13 percent drop in contracts
signed in September compared with last year. The number of canceled
contracts was up 14 percent for the month, said Coldwell Banker's
president and chief operating officer, Maureen Passerini.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''But for October so far,'' Mrs. Passerini said, speaking during the
fourth week of the month, ''we've been quite busy.'' Coldwell Banker
held a Meet the Builder program in New Jersey last Sunday, showing 400
new-home sites, and had 40 signed contracts by Wednesday. The prices of
homes under contract ranges from $200,000 to $1 million or more, she
said.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In the top price range, Mrs. Passerini said, the market sputtered but
is now spurting. Coldwell Banker sold only one home worth $1 million or
more in September in New Jersey, she said. In October so far, it has
sold 10.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The situation is ''patchy,'' several brokers observed. Certain
sectors of the market, notably starter homes, and certain sought-after
towns with a perennially tight inventory of homes for sale -- Ridgewood,
Montclair, Millburn-Short Hills, Mountain Lakes -- seem immune to
jitters in consumer confidence since Sept. 11.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Before the terrorist attacks, a Montclair real estate broker, Jay
Schweppe, was publicly predicting a slowdown in the residential market,
because he believes homes are routinely overpriced in Essex County.
Then, September turned out to be the ''best month ever'' for Schweppe &amp;
Company, Mr. Schweppe said.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Worries about worsening economic times appear to be nearly universal,
though -- along with relief that so far the impact has been relatively
minor.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A slide from record high sales prices in northern New Jersey had
begun by late August. Ms. Olcott of Burgdorff said, ''We already knew
before the tragedy in New York we were not going to see those numbers
again.''
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Prices have been climbing about 5 percent a year across the
Northeast, according to the National Association of Realtors. In much of
New Jersey, prices were climbing faster than that. In Bergen County
earlier this year, the median sales price for existing homes ranked in
the nation's top 20.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Still, New Jersey residential prices do not approach those in
Manhattan. This may help buoy the market here despite an economic
downtown, realtors said, especially if there is a wave of New Yorkers
relocating in the wake of the attack.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''I was showing a couple from Manhattan a $1.8 million home in
Mendham earlier this month,'' said Lindy Peteet, a luxury property
specialist with Weichert. ''Her eyes got so big. I wasn't sure what she
was thinking, so I asked her: 'Are you pleased with what you're looking
at?' ''
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''It turned out she was amazed at the value,'' Ms. Peteet said.
''They live in a brownstone, and this was 6,500 square feet on three
acres.''
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
IN the days after Sept. 11, realtors and brokers reported, the
generally robust sales activity abruptly diminished to nearly nil.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''There was a dramatic drop-off, for about 10 days,'' said Gary J.
Stefanoni, sales and marketing manager for Pulte Homes, a builder of
upscale town house communities in Paramus, Holmdel and Warren.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Jacelyn Botti, Weichert Realtors' senior vice president for the
tristate area, said,
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''The first week, everybody was traumatized, and very little at all
went on.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''But as we began to move away from that,'' Ms. Botti said, ''the
same thing happened with real estate as with the stock market. We
gradually got in the back-to-work mode, the buying cycle mode.''
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Average attendance of prospective buyers at Weichert Sunday open
houses in New Jersey continues at seven or eight, Ms. Botti said, and
the pace of sales has rebounded. Weichert's rate of sales for the first
half of October was virtually even with October 2000 in New Jersey. Ms.
Botti said she computed monthly ''revenue units'' (a measure of the
value of properties put under sales contract) as being 2,508 at
mid-October 2001 compared with 2,515 a year earlier.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Certain offices have had a flurry of sales activity,'' Ms. Botti
said. She cited Fort Lee, across the George Washington Bridge from
Manhattan. Ms. Botti said there had also been spurts of activity in
towns farther away from New York City, like Rumson, which lies south of
Red Bank, more than a hour from New York City. Generally, though,
residential sales have been strongest in areas closest to New York, she
said.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Ms. Botti's company deals mainly with sale of existing homes. Mr.
Stefanoni of Pulte described roughly the same pattern of recovery in the
market for newly constructed housing. ''After a huge slowdown, people
are coming back and making purchases,'' he said, noting that the second
week in October set a record for sales at Pulte's three town house
developments. ''Buying a home is a big decision, not a frivolous
decision. People who were in the midst of selling, downsizing or adding
to their families -- their lives can't stop, even though the tragedy
will never be forgotten.''
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Stefanoni and other real estate experts said the state's tight
inventory of available housing remains the dominant factor affecting the
market. ''The fact that interest rates keep going down is a good thing,
emotionally,'' Mr. Stefanoni said. ''It makes people think: What better
time?''
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But he said that at luxury communities like Brettonwoods in Paramus,
where the average sales price is in the mid-$500,000's, interest rates
do not determine whether a home is affordable. ''It's more a question of
how much more people will buy, or what luxury items can they install?''
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Ms. Botti, the Weichert vice president, said she was startled by a
sudden jump in the number of homes listed with the company in the first
half of October. ''We're tracking 11 percent more listings than the same
period a year ago -- and we've been tracking below the previous year for
two and a half years,'' Ms. Botti said.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
She said she could report only that some sellers were confiding that
they thought they should put homes on the market now while New Yorkers
may be actively considering relocating from the wounded city. ''They
say, 'I don't know where this is going, but I'm going to get in the
market now and see,' '' she said.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Of course, even an 11 percent increase in listings won't change the
picture much, Ms. Botti observed. ''That's equivalent to about two
months' standing inventory. At normal levels, a marketplace has about
four or five months inventory,'' but New Jersey has been much tighter
than that for some time.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Hundreds of New Jersey residents were killed in the World Trade
Center, and Ms. Olcott of Burgdorff noted -- ''horrible, but true'' --
this may lead to house sales. Ridgewood, like other towns that have
traditionally attracted those who commute to Manhattan's financial
district, has had a number of terror victims and is expected see such
sales, she said.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But tragedy and encroaching recession are not the only factors at
play, Mr. Schweppe asserted. For example, in Montclair, new nonstop rail
service to New York City begins operation in January. ''New transit
options for commuters always provide a boost to a community, and this
will certainly provide a buffer against price drops,'' Mr. Schweppe
said.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''The tie to New York is crucial,'' Mr. Schweppe added, ''in ways
that are double-edged right now, I guess.''

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON, Oct. 17 -- Housing starts rose unexpectedly in September,
the government said today, displaying a surprising resilience in a
rapidly deteriorating economy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But other indicators showed how the slowing economy was taking a toll
on housing over all. Building permits issued, an indicator of builder
confidence, were at their lowest level since 1997. And while total
mortgage applications climbed rapidly, the number of requests for new
home loans, as opposed to refinancings, was down.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Groundbreaking for homes reached a seasonally adjusted rate of 1.574
million units last month, a 1.7 percent increase over the August rate of
1.548 million units, the Commerce Department said. Analysts had expected
housing starts to drop.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Housing starts rose 4.4 percent compared with the month a year
earlier. The rate of home starts exceeded the estimates of analysts, who
had forecast a 1.512 million unit pace.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The rate of building permits being issued fell 3 percent in
September. Permits were at their lowest level since December 1997, when
they were at 1.456 million. Permit issuance was unchanged in August but
had fallen 1 percent in July.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The September drop was the biggest decline since permits fell 3.5
percent in February. Permits were down 1.6 percent from September a year
ago.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mortgage applications rose 6.5 percent compared with those a week
earlier and by 72.2 percent compared with those four weeks earlier,
according to the weekly survey by the Mortgage Bankers Association of
America. Applications were up 204.5 percent compared with a year earlier.

All-Important Housing Market Softens at the Top End
</span>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
LONGMONT, Colo. -- In a neighborhood on one side of Clover Basin
Drive, here in this Denver suburb, nearly all the new homes are taken.
Closely bunched production houses on small lots, they have drawn buyers
like Ryan Bonino, a 25-year-old salesman of luxury cars, who was
gratified to find something affordable in one of the nation's hottest
markets. In April, flush with a $44,000 profit from selling his first
house here after just a year, Mr. Bonino snapped up a two-story,
three-bedroom frame home for $268,000.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But in the neighborhood just across the street, custom-built $600,000
and $800,000 homes, with three-car garages, granite countertops and
sprawling lawns, remain unsold.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Across this region, inventories of unsold high-end houses are rising
and some sellers are having to trim their asking prices. ''You can
actually negotiate prices in today's market, and it hasn't been that way
in five to seven years,'' said Stuart Wright, a real estate broker in
nearby Boulder.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In this and many other areas around the nation, prices for the most
expensive homes are softening after a long run, while demand for more
moderately priced housing remains firm.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Seldom has so much ridden on which way the housing market turns. As
layoffs mount and businesses cut back on investment and the stock market
falters, escalating home prices and continued homebuilding have become a
central bulwark against recession.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''The only thing holding up the economy is housing and consumer
spending,'' said Eric S. Belsky, executive director of the Joint Center
for Housing Studies at Harvard University. ''If house price declines
stay confined to the high end, that may not have serious negative
consequences, but if they start filtering down to the middle class,
that's likely to take a big toll.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Robust home values, up 26 percent nationally over the five years
through June, have helped prop up wavering consumer confidence and
supported the spending that has kept the economy barely growing.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The housing market draws its continuing strength from low mortgage
rates, an expanding population, rising incomes and, in a lot of areas,
anti-sprawl measures limiting land for new homes. But in many places,
these pillars no longer fully support prices in the upper range.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In Seattle, the number of million-dollar homes still for sale has
risen by half over the last year while listings of middle-priced homes
have shrunk. In California, homes in affluent towns lost value in the
second quarter while more modest areas posted strong gains. In Texas,
the largest price increases this year have come from towns with moderate
housing costs, like Longview, Abilene and Sherman.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Across metropolitan New York, median home prices rose 10.5 percent in
the last year, and 5 percent in the second quarter, according to the
National Association of Realtors. But in Manhattan, the average sales
price of luxury co-op apartments -- defined as two to four bedrooms on
Park Avenue, Fifth Avenue or Central Park West -- fell 25 percent in the
second quarter, to $2.05 million, according to Douglas Elliman, the real
estate brokerage firm.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In the 1990's, the most expensive homes, now costing $750,000 and up,
appreciated the most in many regions, as the wealthiest Americans had
their income gains compounded by their stock market profits. Now, as the
stock market has reversed, so have the upper reaches of the housing
market. Many well-off professionals and executives, especially, have
been stripped of their huge gains on stock option packages and
investments.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Layoffs -- and fears of greater job cuts -- have also had an impact.
Around Denver, job cuts and falling stock prices at large employers in
the struggling telecommunications industry -- like Level 3
Communications -- have helped cool the housing market. While the
official numbers, which include some lower-priced homes, are not as
extreme, Jack O'Connor, a Denver broker, calculates that the inventory
of the most expensive homes here now stands at 27 months, quadruple the
level a year ago.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But, by and large, the market for moderately priced houses remains
healthy: median existing-home prices nationally rose 6.4 percent for the
year ended in June, according to the National Association of Realtors.
Housing starts during July rose 2.8 percent over their June level, to
their highest in a year and a half, the Commerce Department reported.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The reasons for the divergence are illustrated here in metropolitan
Denver, one of the prime growth areas of the 1990's. In the late 1980's,
it suffered from a severe glut of homes at all prices. Today, it has the
highest median home prices of any metropolitan area outside the two
coasts, according to the association of realtors.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Low mortgage rates are part of the favorable equation, as they are
elsewhere. Population growth, stronger than expected nationally in part
because of immigration, has been especially strong around Denver. And
over the last several years, Colorado residents have had some of the
biggest personal income gains in the nation.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
At the same time, attempts to limit growth have curtailed the supply
of houses, as residents fight to avoid sprawling tract homes and malls.
While slow-growth rules here are some of the most extreme, such measures
have proliferated in many areas, leaving land for new homes in shorter
supply.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In addition, many Colorado lenders and builders have remained
cautious despite the sizzling market. The overbuilding of the 1980's
that left large speculative housing developments standing unoccupied was
burned into their memories.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
All these factors are present nationwide in some measure, and they
are likely to keep most of the housing market from backsliding much,
even if the economy enters a full-blown recession, many economists say.
While the pace is sure to slow, ''I think the fundamentals are still
there for healthy home price appreciation,'' said David Lereah, the
chief economist at the National Association of Realtors.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Nonetheless, the softening at the high end of the market, if it
persists, could have widespread consequences as affluent homeowners,
already hit by stock market losses, experience a drop in the value of
their homes and the equity they own. That could further chill consumers'
spirits, particularly among the big spenders who played such a critical
role in the boom of the late 1990's.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''If consumer confidence drops, they'll stop spending, then the
economy is going to tumble, and that's a big concern for me,'' said Jim
Cobb, owner of Cornerstone Homes, a home builder in Longmont.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Steven Weiting, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, contends that the
appreciation in home values is sure to cool, since turns in the stock
market usually lead to changes in housing prices. But he calls a
collapse unlikely, noting that overall inventories of unsold houses
remain low.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In July, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve,
affirmed the importance of rising home values. ''As home ownership rises
and as the market value of homes continues to rise, even in a period
when stock prices are falling,'' he said, ''we're observing a rather
remarkable employment of that so-called home equity wealth in all sorts
of household decisions.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Recent housing market gains and continued home building contrast
sharply with steep cutbacks in business investment. Such spending
plunged 14.6 percent in the second quarter, slowing overall economic
growth to the most sluggish pace in eight years, a mere 0.2 percent
annual rate.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In past slowdowns, housing has tended to lead the economy's fall. But
the character of the current slowdown has made this time different, said
Robert Van Order, the chief economist at Freddie Mac. In the early
1980's, he said, efforts by the Federal Reserve chairman, Paul A.
Volcker, to squeeze inflation out of the economy by pushing interest
rates up sharply sent the cost of mortgages soaring, crippling housing
sales. During the recession and housing slowdown in the early 1990's,
much of the problem was related to the poor financial footing of banks
and savings and loans.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But the latest slowdown is happening largely on what he called the
''real'' side of the economy -- including manufacturing and investment
in plant and equipment -- rather than on the financial side.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''The financial system is in pretty good shape,'' Mr. Van Order said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In Denver, these trends have played out in dramatic fashion. By the
late 1980's, the real estate market here was so depressed that builders
were faced with more than a year's inventory of unsold homes, a result
of rampant overbuilding financed by savings and loans, and the collapse
of energy prices, which pulled a crucial support from the local economy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But since then the turnaround has been so sharp that in two affluent
suburbs north of downtown, Boulder and Longmont, prices soared 147
percent in the decade that ended in March, according to federal data.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Part of such appreciation comes from soaring demand. During the
1990's, Colorado's population gained almost 31 percent, more than double
the nation's. Around Denver, people flocked to live within view of the
Front Range of the Rockies. And during the two years ended in March,
personal incomes in Colorado jumped 20.4 percent, the most of any state,
compared with 13.4 percent nationwide.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
On the supply side, efforts to limit growth have made it difficult
for builders to keep up. Sales of new homes in Boulder County, which
includes Boulder and Longmont, fell 45 percent during the first half of
the year, compared with the period in 2000, according to the Genesis
Group, a local research firm. That decline, despite a 15 percent gain in
average existing-home prices over the last year in this county, came
primarily because of growth controls that limited the supply of new
building lots, the study found.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''There's no doubt growth caps increase the cost of housing,'' said
Leona Stoecker, the mayor of Longmont. ''It's basic economics 101 --
when there's a shortage of something, prices increase.'' New housing
approvals here commonly take three years, and impact fees to offset the
cost of roads, sewers and other infrastructure can top $20,000 a home.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
At the same time, the area's lenders and builders have been more
restrained than during past booms, learning their lessons from the busts
that invariably followed. ''If builders learned anything from that, it
was to build to demand,'' said Pat Fisher, owner of Gallery Homes in
Lafayette, Colo.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Over all, inventories of existing homes in the six counties of the
Denver metropolitan area rose at the end of the second quarter to 3.4
months, compared with 2 months a year before. Inventories of new homes
rose to 1.6 months, up from 1.3 months at the end of the year.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The outlook for the high-end market is less encouraging. Builders had
expected a continued influx of high-technology employees, flush with
stock options, said Tom Hoyt, chief executive of McStain Enterprises,
one of the area's largest independent builders. But the opposite
happened, he says: not only has the influx halted, but some of those
here have been laid off, and still more have stood by helplessly as
their options became worthless.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''All of a sudden you've got a two-  or three-year supply,'' Mr. Hoyt
said, ''and I don't think we know yet what the effect is going to be.''

The demand for the most expensive houses in the Denver area has started
to soften, swelling the inventory of unsold existing homes on the
market. But homes in the middle range are still selling at a healthy

Housing Legislation In Need of Reworking

To the Editor:
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Although I support the concept of affordable housing, the legislation
under which small towns are required to approve large high-density
developments with only 30 percent ''affordable'' units is a total
bonanza for developers (''Affordable Housing Fight Will Not Let Up,''
Aug. 5).
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
This legislation is custom-made for developers who can overturn local
planning and zoning regulations to make a fast buck in an inappropriate
location leaving sprawl, additional congestion, transportation problems
and environmental degradation in the aftermath.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Haphazardly mandating affordable housing does not address the more
fundamental issues of planning, which must include all the requirements
and impacts on a community. If there is to be any future open space,
clean air and clean water in Connecticut, then sprawling development in
rural areas must be curtailed.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The best community planning and the logical place for dense
development is in villages, towns and cities with existing
infrastructure and transportation options.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
How will our wonderful cities, which have abundant opportunities for
restored and redeveloped housing, ever reach their former vital glory if
affordable housing legislation mandates that developers consume every
acre of rural open space remaining?

''FABULOUS.'' ''Best May ever.'' ''Best June on record.''
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
New Jersey residential real estate brokers and agents are so
energetically upbeat about the direction of sales prices in the spring
that the image of a new chorus line for ''The Producers'' leaps to mind:
high-kicking realtors belting out ''Springtime for real estate in New
Jersey!''
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Both the retail and the commercial markets may be showing signs of
slowing, but residential home sales? Ah, the fresh, sweet smell of
rising dollar volume after a weak winter.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
At Weichert Realtors, ''we came off the best May on record, and we
are paced for the best June on record,'' said Jacelyn Botti, a senior
vice president. Ms. Botti added that early in-house numbers indicated
that the average sales price for July would be more than 20 percent
higher than for July 2000.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Coldwell Banker's president and chief operating officer, Maureen
Passerini, who is a director of the 12,000-member Garden State Multiple
Listing Service, said: ''Momentum has been picking up in April, May and
June around central and northern New Jersey. Sales were up 6 percent
this June over last.''
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In the dollar value of homes sold, Mrs. Passerini said the numbers
were up 11 percent for the year to date, with 6 percentage points of
that surge occurring in May and June.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''I've been doing real estate for five years,'' said Betty Anne
McKenna, a Coldwell Banker saleswoman in Monmouth County, ''and this is
the busiest summer I've had. At the office meeting here last Tuesday,
they had to tape extra pages onto the bottom of our board where we show
activity for the month. It holds 40 in each column, sales and listings.
The sales were off the page, and listings were almost to the bottom.''
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mrs. McKenna held a Sunday open house for a home in Manalapan priced
at $539,000, high for an area where an average home sells for almost
$200,000 less. She said the home was newer than many in the area --
three years old, while others are 30 to 40 years old -- and bigger, with
five bedrooms and three baths. Eighteen people or couples showed up, and
one couple, Steve and Sandy Kaplan, had signed a contract to buy it for
$525,000 by Monday evening.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Almost uniformly, realtors say that home  buyers who may have waited
anxiously while the stock market gyrated earlier this year are now
shopping with gusto.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A contrary view comes from Jay Schweppe, who owns Schweppe &amp; Company,
a one-office real estate agency in Montclair.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A man of singular confidence and outspokenness -- Mr. Schweppe says
happy-talking real-estate specialists are ''trying to make everything
look good'' -- he says the New Jersey residential market is on the down
slide.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''This is strictly a cyclical business, with value entirely based on
consumer confidence,'' Mr. Schweppe said, ''and consumer confidence is
going down.''
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Not because of the shaky stock market, Mr. Schweppe insisted, but
because home values are inflated due to the tight inventory and because
overpricing feeds on itself.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
When there are fewer homes to sell, fierce buyer competition and
multiple bids become commonplace in towns like Montclair, where homes
are generally in good condition, schools are good and the commute to New
York City is short. ''Somebody steps up to bat every time a desirable
home comes on the market and pays whatever it takes,'' Mr. Schweppe
said.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Ms. Botti of Weichert says that only a few years ago, when a buyer's
agent found out that multiple offers were being made, the  agent would
suggest that the client offer 10  percent over the list price. ''Now,''
Ms. Botti said, ''you really have to extend yourself.''
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In certain towns, there are cases of people bidding $100,000 or more
over asking price and still losing out, according to Mr. Schweppe, Ms.
Botti and others.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
However, the Schweppe view is that things have begun to shift:
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''The buildup is happening, and it's because we've overpriced the
product. You can see it all over, even in the so-called safe towns like
Montclair, and Short Hills, and Chatham, with houses sitting on the
market for two and three months.''
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
On Lloyd Road in Montclair, he continued, ''Right now, there's one
that's been on the market for two months. It's because it's a $2 million
house that's not worth it. The sellers, and ineffective real estate
people, see a house that has multiple bids and sells for way over asking
price, and then they price the house next door or up the street based on
that. Then, when other sellers see that asking price, they base their
asking price on that. It's ridiculous, and buyers have had enough.''
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
THE current teeter-totter relationship between inventory and sales
price -- while not yet substantiated in official listing service
numbers, which are not reported until sales are closed -- can be
discerned by looking at reports of signed contracts. The New Jersey
Multiple Listing Service, which has 5,500 members in north-central New
Jersey, mostly in Essex and Bergen Counties, offers numbers for June
with a clear pattern: number of sales down, average home prices up.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
That same pattern appears in the Garden State listing service numbers
comparing June 2001 with June 2000 in Essex, Morris, Passaic, Somerset,
Sussex, Union and Warren Counties.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In big, booming Bergen County, where new antisprawl regulations have
yet to slow new construction as they have elsewhere, the pattern is
different, but positive. Both the number of sales and the average sales
price are up for January through June of this year, compared with the
same period last year, according to the listing service.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The specter of an inventory buildup caused by the continuing rapid
rise in sales prices hovers in every locale, however.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Judy Reeves, president and chief operating officer at Burgdorff
Realtors, called her company's June business fabulous, with  signed
contracts up 8 percent from a year earlier. June closings were ''way off
the charts,'' she says, for homes that had signed contracts earlier in
the spring.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Things in good locations, cream puff locations, still receive
multiple offers even though there is apprehension in the market about
layoffs and the economy,'' says Ms. Reeves, whose company is based in
Parsippany.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Sellers have caught on to multiple offers, and some are becoming
too greedy. That's when a property sits.''
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Coldwell Banker's president, Mrs. Passerini, says the market is
robust in most places. She cited the case of a young New York City
couple looking for a house in Mountain Lakes, where the man grew up.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''They found a nice colonial with a hot tub, very unusual in Mountain
Lakes. They outbid everyone and got the house. While the sale was
undergoing the three-day attorney review -- and offers can still be
accepted -- four more came in.''
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mrs. Passerini says that inventory will inevitably begin to grow and
prices to drop but adds that the marketplace can remain strong because
demand for houses is so pent up.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''We represent a lot of builders,'' she said,  ''and this never
happens. I've been doing this 27 years, but they are building $3 million
to $4 million houses on spec. There are seven going up right now.''
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Ms. Botti of Weichert, predicting ''no letup,'' continues to advise
sellers to be very aggressive in setting list prices. Some appraisers
are applying a certain percentage per month that a home will appreciate
while the closing is pending when setting its value for a mortgage
company, Ms. Botti says.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''We tell sellers, 'You should have the value of that appreciation up
until closing, not the buyer,' '' she said. Ms. Botti says Weichert has
also represented buyers who closed on a property, put it back on the
market immediately and made thousands of dollars.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Ms. Reeves of Burgdorff says she cannot make predictions. ''Hey, this
is a fun market to watch,'' she laughed. ''You can't really tell what
will happen!''

Housing Shortage Is Alive and Well

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A LEGISLATIVE commission that studied the affordable housing issue in
Connecticut last year concluded that despite laws that make it a lot
tougher for towns and cities to reject developers' proposals, there is
still a 68,000-unit shortfall of affordable housing in the state.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Housing advocates said that the nearly 2,000 units of affordable
housing and at least another 5,000 units with rents below market value
have been created as a result of the 1989 legislation. They said that
although those units have made only a small dent in reducing the overall
need, without the law the shortage would be even worse.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
They said there are many reasons the gains have come so slowly,
including the persistent battles waged by many towns and their zoning
boards against not only affordable housing, but against any new housing
at all.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Housing advocates, such as the commission's co-chairman, Patrick
Flaherty, a Democratic state representative from Coventry, and Jeffrey
Freiser, executive director of the Connecticut Housing Coalition, said
that only 30 of the state's 169 municipalities are at the 10 percent
affordable housing level that allows towns and cities to be exempt from
the mandate.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
They said some towns are so far from the 10 percent number that it is
unlikely they will ever reach it. But they said that when the law was
created, the expectation was not that every town reach the 10 percent
minimum standard, only that they would be motivated to take some action
to lessen the shortage.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''It's not just that towns are so resistant to affordable housing,
it's that they are strongly opposed to new housing of any kind that is
making our efforts to make significant progress difficult,'' Mr.
Flaherty said. ''For the most part I think these towns just don't want
to have to pay for the increase in their populations, particularly
adding children to their schools systems that could impact taxes.''
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Flaherty said he was frustrated by affordable housing opponents
who ''on one hand say that the affordable housing law is having this
devastating impact on their communities because they are being forced to
allow so much new housing, but at the same they say the law is not
helping to create enough units and isn't working. You can't have it both
ways.''
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Opponents of the law said they are not against affordable housing,
just to a mandate they said has not been effective.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Promoting many of these developments as affordable is misleading at
best,'' said Trumbull First Selectman Kenneth Halaby.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
He said his town was making efforts to add ''real affordable housing
in smaller clusters instead of luxury apartments in massive developments
that hurt the town.''
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Freiser said the efforts by towns to prevent the housing units
hurt the entire state because the lack of housing discourages companies
from relocating to Connecticut when they learn their employees cannot
afford to live in many parts of the state.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''That was one of the main reasons the law was created in the first
place,'' Mr. Freiser said.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
He said that according to the 1990 Census, the last census from which
the state's housing numbers are available, nearly half of the total
405,000 renter households lived in either sub-standard conditions or pay
rent considered to be excessive.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Everybody says they want to see more housing provided, but many of
the towns just want to do whatever it takes to keep taxes from going
up,'' Mr. Freiser said. ''Eventually, the lack of housing is going to
seriously impact the state's economy. Maybe that's what it will take for
people to realize the lack of housing is a crucial issue.''

Blacks Hit by Housing Costs Leave San Francisco Behind

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
An article yesterday about an exodus of black residents from San
Francisco gave an incorrect surname in some copies for the former San
Francisco 49ers owner whose legal troubles stalled development plans in
a black neighborhood. He is Eddie DeBartolo Jr., not Bartolo. A map with
the article referred incorrectly in some copies to a neighborhood where
a jazz district has been proposed. It is the Fillmore, not Filmore.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES FRIDAY AUGUST 03, 2001
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 1 -- At 21 years old, Shanika Long is giving up
on San Francisco, the city she was born and reared in and would rather
still call home.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Her mother tells her of a time when blacks owned certain parts of
town, when the Fillmore District, for one, was a vibrant neighborhood
with, she recalls, ''a black-power-type mentality.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But, like the Fillmore's nickname, Harlem West, those days are
history. And Ms. Long, a clerk at the Labor Ready agency for temporary
workers who has a 3-year-old daughter, says she wants to live where
black people can afford to buy houses and rear children.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''I'm moving out and I'm feeling like I'm being pushed out of San
Francisco,'' she said. ''The community now is, like, dead.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
African-Americans, like Ms. Long, are leaving this city in droves.
Over the last 10 years, as public housing and low-income projects have
been torn down and as rents and house prices climbed to record levels,
African-Americans have left San Francisco like no other city.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Census figures show that while the city's overall population
increased more than 7 percent in the 1990's, the number of people who
list their race as black fell from 79,039 in 1990 to 60,515 last year
(with an additional 6,561 reporting some black heritage combined with
another race, the first time the census allowed people to check a
mixed-race category). That leaves the city of 776,733 with a black
population of 8.6 percent.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Other cities have had notable declines in their black populations
over the last decade -- Washington, for example.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But blacks in other cities appear to be migrating to the suburbs in a
pattern of upward mobility. In San Francisco, many are leaving because
they have no choice. Gentrification during the dot-com boom gave the
city the distinction as the most expensive in the country.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Landlords in black neighborhoods, much like others, cashed in,
raising rents and evicting long-term tenants.  The recent technology
bust has had little effect in lowering housing prices, real estate
experts say. And since blacks have always been a relatively small
minority here (13 percent of the population at its height in 1970) the
consequences are striking.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The result, in one of the few major cities with a black mayor and a
liberal political sensibility in sync with a majority of
African-Americans, is a San Francisco with whole neighborhoods where it
is rare to see a black person. It is a city where blacks have little
clout, few cultural institutions and only one remaining neighborhood,
the homely, lonely Bayview-Hunters Point, best known for a sewage
treatment plant and radioactive Superfund site.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
For many blacks here, San Francisco is the sweetheart who loved 'em
and left 'em, who promised the moon and stars only to forget them when
new blood came to town.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In the Fillmore, there has been much talk over the years of
establishing a jazz district in honor of the jazz scene that emerged in
the neighborhood from 1940 to 1950. It was the heyday of the community,
when the black population of the city grew tenfold as thousands of
blacks came to San Francisco looking for war jobs, many of them at the
Navy shipyard at Hunters Point. But the jazz project has been in the
planning stages for years with little action.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In 1997, Mayor Willie L. Brown Jr. promised to bring Bayview-Hunters
Point thousands of jobs, a new stadium for the San Francisco 49ers and a
megamall to go along with it. Voters approved the project in 1997,
agreeing to finance it with $100 million in bonds. But the project was
stalled when the 49ers owner, Eddie De Bartolo Jr., became embroiled in
legal troubles and lost the team to his sister and her husband. The mall
project is still in the talking stages.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Many blacks have little hope of things improving anytime soon. Even
the black churches, the soul of the black community, have lost their
influence. The Rev. Cecil Williams, pastor of the Glide Memorial
Methodist Church, perhaps the sole remaining influential church, with
more than 50 social and community programs, says that as blacks have
moved, the churches have lost their base.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Naturally, you're going to lose some of that vibrancy,'' said Mr.
Williams, who blamed ''economics, first and foremost -- the cost of
living in this city'' -- as the reason for the black exodus. His church
is thriving, with more than 1,500 members of all races, many of whom
drive from as far as Sacramento, 85 miles away. It also attracts
busloads of tourists, drawn by the church's popular choir and band.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The mayor, through a spokesman, P. J. Johnston, said that not all
blacks were leaving because they could not afford to stay.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Those who would tell you it's simply a matter of poor people not
being able to afford to live in this City obviously don't understand the
black community, or the City of San Francisco,' Mr. Johnston said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Some homeowners, he said, have sold their houses to cash in on the
market and moved to more affordable cities. But, he conceded,
lower-income renters ''have had trouble keeping pace with this rise in
housing costs, and many have moved to cheaper digs around the Bay
Area.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Some are moving to working-class cities like Vallejo, Richmond or
Fairfield, which have significant black populations and where it is
still possible to buy a house for under $300,000.  But census figures
suggest that  blacks appear to be bypassing Oakland, where
African-Americans represent over a third of the population. In the last
decade, that city, too, has seen a decline in its black population --
from 163,500 out of 399,500 residents in 1990 to 142,400 out of 372, 200
residents in 2000 -- as gentrification forced some low-income blacks to
the further reaches of the area.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Black-owned businesses in San Francisco have also left. Fred Jordan,
a past president of the San Francisco Black Chamber of Commerce, said:
''There used to be 138 African-American businesses along Fillmore
Street. Last I heard there were 32 left and very hard to find.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
One that remains is Perry's Joint, a coffee and candy shop, on
Fillmore Street. Perry Bennett opened the shop eight years ago, hoping
to buy into the neighborhood's history. But now only 15 percent to 20
percent of his customers are black, he said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
While the Fillmore has been losing blacks for decades -- federal
urban renewal projects in the 1960's displaced thousands of blacks to
make way for a boulevard and Japan Trade Center, shops and plazas -- Mr.
Bennett started his business at a time when community leaders were
talking revitalization. But even in the eight years that he has been
around, Mr. Bennett said, he has watched dozens of businesses close and
hundreds of customers move.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Like some other African-American business owners in the city, Mr.
Bennett complains that blacks lack the unity and community spirit to
achieve success here. ''If we had that, in the Bayview-Hunters Point
area,'' he said, ''where blacks own all the homes, all the apartments
and we had a black business district going all up and down Third Street,
and we were a constituency that could put someone in office that is
going to look out for our interests, we wouldn't be having this
conversation.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
African-Americans do own most of the houses in Bayview-Hunters Point,
but the prices of the modest starter house never kept pace with the rest
of San Francisco's; homeowners who wanted to trade up were forced to
leave the Bay Area to afford something better.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Sophie Maxwell, a city supervisor who represents Bayview-Hunters
Point, said projects in the works should improve the neighborhood.
''Economic revitalization is what we're looking at,'' Ms. Maxwell said.
''We're losing numbers so we're trying to identify and work on the
assets in this community.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The neighborhood's open space, parking places, vacant lots are all
assets that developers are exploring, she said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Eric Martin, a 43-year-old salesman at the Record Shop in Bayview,
said Asians, whose numbers are steadily climbing here, could teach
blacks how to move forward.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''The Filipinos come in and they got five families living in one
house,'' Mr. Martin said. ''That's how they do it, how they can afford
it. Then they buy the house, then they buy another house. They got
unity. Brothers ain't like that. It used to be like that way back in the
60's and 70's.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The major obstacle to attracting new life has been the Navy shipyard,
which brought so many thousands of blacks to San Francisco during the
war. Since the Defense Department closed the shipyard in 1974, the
neighborhood has been overshadowed by its aging hulking buildings,
several of which are contaminated with radioactive waste.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Some see the toxic waste that has made Bayview-Hunters Point the
subject of scorn and ridicule as the one reason the black population has
not been pushed out of its stronghold.  ''It's what's killing this
community and at the same time it may be preserving what we have,'' said
Rebecca Logue Bovee, an organizer with the Housing Rights Committee.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Deborah Dean, a 41-year-old cashier at the Record Shop, sees the
plans to redevelop Bayview as a plot to drive out blacks, because
''blacks don't represent the white tourism image of the city.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''I live where you can hear the games from the new Giants ballpark
and everything and you can see the lights,'' she said. ''And it's just a
beautiful view. If it wasn't for the toxic waste, they would have taken
this hill a long time ago.''

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON, March 16 -- Prices paid to manufacturers, farmers and
other producers rose a modest 0.1 percent in February, while industrial
production slumped in the month, new reports showed today, suggesting
that the Federal Reserve has leeway to cut interest rates deeper and
quicker.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But a survey on consumer sentiment showed an unexpected swing in
optimism, confounding some investors. Another piece of data that
indicated some strength in the economy was the February report on
housing starts, which fell slightly but stayed at a robust level. Still,
today's overall economic picture ''certainly increases the chances''
that Fed policy makers will cut interest rates by three-quarters of a
point when they meet on Tuesday, said Cary Leahey, senior economist at
Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. in New York.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The gain in the Producer Price Index followed a 1.1 percent jump in
January that surprised investors and was the biggest since October 1999.
February's core index, which excludes volatile food and energy costs,
fell 0.3 percent after rising 0.7 percent in January, the Labor
Department said. Last month the decline in the core index, the largest
since August 1993, was led by lower prices for autos, computers and
paper.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Energy prices rose 1.4 percent in February, after rising 3.8 percent
in January, led by a 19 percent surge in the cost of liquefied petroleum
gas.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Production at factories, utilities and mines fell 0.6 percent in
February, twice the drop expected by economists, after a similar decline
in January. It was the fifth consecutive monthly decline, the longest
such string since a six-month slump from October 1990 to March 1991, the
heart of the last recession.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Manufacturing has suffered the most from the economic slowdown.
Factories reported production fell 0.4 percent last month after a 0.6
percent drop in January, the Fed reported today.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A study by the University of Michigan found that consumers were more
upbeat about their finances and economic prospects this month than they
were in February. The university said its preliminary index of consumer
sentiment for March rose to 91.8, compared with a final reading of 90.6
in February, people with access to the study said. Analysts had expected
the index to fall to 89.5 The index, set in 1966, has a base of 100.
Increases or decreases from that level indicate Americans' degree of
comfort with their finances and the state of the economy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The university's preliminary index of current economic conditions was
104.1 in March, down from a final reading of 105.8 in February. The
preliminary index of expectations was 84.0 in March, compared with 80.8
in February, and 86.4 in January. The university's survey, however, was
largely completed before this week's steep slide in the stock market.
The Commerce Department's housing report showed that construction of new
homes decreased 0.4 percent -- the first decline since October -- to an
annual rate of 1.647 million units in February from a pace of 1.653
million in January. The annual pace of construction in February was
close to the 1.593 million units built last year.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To the Editor:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A March 3 front-page article says ''New Jersey's effort to foster low-income housing is colliding head-on with its ambitious plans to limit sprawl.'' There is a solution -- if towns take an active role instead of ceding control to developers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some towns let developers, under the ''inclusionary development mechanism,'' build four market-rate houses for each lower-priced unit. A developer can also sue a town that does not have a housing plan, as required by state law, and the same mechanism is most often put into effect. But if towns met their housing obligations directly by creating the number of affordable units called for under a state formula, they could control their own development.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Erica Hutchinson and her fiance, Lynn Corbett, bought their brownstone in the Clinton Hill section of Brooklyn for $175,000 three years ago, they persuaded a bank to lend them $230,000. Their argument was that the value of their new home would jump once they used the extra mortgage money to gut the three-story building and fill it with new bathrooms, a new kitchen, new flooring, new windows -- new everything.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They were right, of course. The Corbetts, now married, say that after several years of a flush New York economy their brownstone would easily sell today for at least $370,000. Their bankers seem to agree. The couple recently added a $30,000 home equity loan, using the new money to pay off credit card bills. ''The construction costs were more than we had anticipated so we charged them,'' said Ms. Corbett, who is 30, like her husband, ''and we paid for our wedding with credit cards, too.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For most American families, their home is their biggest investment, and after years of prosperity in which home prices rose substantially, family wealth has increased as well. But like the Corbetts, millions of households borrowed heavily against their homes, often to help support greater spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The borrowing has been so extensive, in fact, that homeowners, after building up equity through much of the 1960's and 1970's, have let their ownership shares deteriorate over the last two decades to the lowest level on record, the Federal Reserve reports. The borrowing even accelerated in the 1990's, helping to explain how Americans managed to easily outspend their incomes through two long economic expansions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now a slowing economy catches the average household owning less of a stake in its home than in any economic slowdown since the advent of the modern mortgage in the 1930's. If a recession develops and people start worrying that they have too little equity left to continue borrowing safely against their homes, the blow to spending could turn a mild recession into a prolonged one. That would certainly happen, economists say, if a downturn causes home prices to fall, shrinking even more the equity stake that households still have in their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When you make borrowing dependent on your home, then you erode the fire wall that protects your standard of living and we are going into this slowdown with the fire wall clearly eroded,'' said Nicolas Retsinas, director of the Joint Center on Housing Studies at Harvard. ''The home is not just a financial transaction, it defines who you are and what kind of community you live in. When all of a sudden you get into trouble, you can't just rip it up like a credit card.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average homeowning household owed lenders 46 percent of the market value of its residence during last year's third quarter, up sharply from about 30 percent in 1982 and 40 percent in 1991, at the start of the current economic expansion, the Fed reports show. For a typical family with a home worth the median market value of $144,000 late last year, that meant their equity was $77,760 while their debt was $66,240.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That still sounds like a relatively safe cushion. But American society once exalted a different norm -- a 20 percent down payment and the balance paid off through a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. The Champagne toasts and mortgage burnings that celebrated the final payment are gone today. Instead, a growing number of Americans are approaching or entering retirement still making hefty home payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many ways, the shift makes sense. Home equity loans and the refinancing of mortgages have become vehicles for converting standard consumer debt into loans that usually enjoy tax breaks, lower interest rates and smaller monthly payments. Millions of people have managed to borrow against their homes at rates under 10 percent, while channeling other funds into retirement plans and into a stock market that until recently achieved average returns of 15 percent or more a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever the justifications, the family home is now more at risk as collateral for the spending that underpins economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The vulnerability cuts two ways. For people like the Corbetts, convinced that their brownstone on St. James Place can only rise in value as their neighborhood improves, there is still room to borrow more and spend it avidly, softening any downturn. ''We are definitely ahead of the game,'' said Ms. Corbett, who works in the fashion industry. Her husband runs a Boy's Town center in Brooklyn and their income is $120,000 a year, not counting the $1,300 a month they receive as rent for an apartment in their brownstone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for homeowners like Thomas Murray, an executive for a Cincinnati company that cleans food processing plants, even a leveling off of home prices would be chilling. He is painfully aware that if he sold his four-bedroom brick suburban home for the $220,000 that he thinks he can get for it and then paid off his mortgage and his home equity loan, he would walk away with -- as he puts it -- ''$8, maybe $9.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If I had to take a pay cut or had to accept another job for a lower level of pay, then I would have the credit card problem again, and no equity left in my home to solve it,'' said Mr. Murray, 36, who landed his present job last spring at a sharp increase in salary, to above $100,000. Over the last five years, he had made less than $80,000 a year. As a result, the family accumulated $20,000 in credit card debt, which he and his wife recently converted to a $25,000 home equity loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Car repair, dental bills, mandatory home repairs, clothing for the kids, birthday parties, you cannot afford all this and stay out of debt,'' Mr. Murray said. ''Unless you have a big enough income, which I have -- now.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big concern among economists is not a relatively short recession, but a longer one, lasting a year or so. ''In a brief recession, the extra borrowing and spending would even soften the downturn,'' Mark Zandi, chief economist at Economy.com in West Chester, Pa., said. Indeed, a new surge in mortgage refinancing as interest rates fall -- the fourth surge since 1993 -- is likely to give a lift to spending as some people go further into debt, pocketing the extra mortgage money without increasing their monthly payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But in a longer recession,'' Mr. Zandi said, ''housing prices would weaken and many homeowners could easily find themselves owing more on their homes than the homes were worth.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If that happened, the abrupt pullback in spending as these families tried to work down their debts and preserve their homes would exacerbate a recession. Many Japanese behaved in just this way after the collapse in real estate prices in that country a decade ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or, with monthly mortgage and home equity payments in the United States at a record level as a percentage of disposable income, trouble on the job -- layoffs, for example, or cutbacks in overtime pay -- could quickly restrict spending, also deepening a recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alexander Wright, a 40-year-old aircraft mechanic for <span class="companylink">Northrop Grumman</span> in Jacksonville, Fla., is currently going through just this experience. He is among the millions of relatively new homeowners who could not meet the old requirements for a down payment to purchase a home, but achieved his goal as lenders relaxed their standards, offering mortgages that cover nearly the entire cost of a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage insurance has encouraged this expansion of homeownership. So has the increasingly popular practice of packaging mortgages into bonds that are then sold to many investors, thus spreading the risk of default. Government-sponsored programs aimed at allowing lower-income families to buy a home with little money down have helped as well. Together with the robust economy, these forces have propelled homeownership to a record 67.7 percent of all households, although many of the new homeowners own only a modest stake in their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wright and his wife, Carvetta, an assembly line worker in a microchip plant, are in this situation, having purchased their three-bedroom ranch house several years ago for $64,500, obtaining a mortgage for the entire amount.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've done a lot of renovation, doing the work myself, and I would price the house now at $82,000,'' Mr. Wright said. He has worked the mortgage down to under $55,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the family also owes $30,000 on a home equity loan the Wrights took out to pay off credit card bills and to help buy a car. With two teenagers, they were paying off the debt without undue sacrifice, Mr. Wright said, until his overtime suddenly stopped last June. Repair work at <span class="companylink">Northrop Grumman</span> had slowed. The Wrights' combined annual income is about $54,000, and the overtime once added $10,000 a year. Without it, the payments on the debt continue, but family spending is curtailed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I am going to try not to draw down the $4,000 that remains on my home equity credit line,'' Mr. Wright said. ''We are trying to tough it out. We don't go out anymore, and we try not to buy the name-brand clothes that the kids want, none of that Tommy Hilfiger stuff. We had two dogs, and we got rid of one.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Mr. Wright is worried, David Murphy, who owns a home in Madeira, an upscale Cincinnati suburb, certainly is not. The Murphys -- he sells computer systems to hospitals, she is an electrical engineer -- completed a lavish $130,000 kitchen renovation last year, borrowing the full sum to expand the space to make room for a stone fireplace and archway. They installed new custom cabinets, granite counter tops and a Sub-Zero refrigerator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was only the latest renovation to a three-bedroom home that the Murphys bought nine years ago for $225,000, putting $50,000 down and borrowing $175,000. The upgrades include an entertainment room and an outdoor cooking center, and the debt against the home has risen to $400,000. But Mr. Murphy is confident that he could sell his home for $550,000 today. A bank appraiser told him that the $130,000 kitchen remodeling raised the selling price of the home by the full amount spent on the renovation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is that accurate? Or are people overly optimistic about the values of their homes?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are stunned by the optimism that shows up in our surveys,'' said David F. Seiders, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders in Washington. ''The attitude used to be that remodeling is great, but don't expect to get it back in resale value.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Murphy could well be right about his home. But what if he is wrong? ''There is not yet a problem with house prices,'' Mr. Seiders said, ''but if this slowdown continues, you could see problems.''</p>

Efforts to Restrict Sprawl Find New Resistance From Advocates for
Affordable Housing

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
AUSTIN, Tex., Dec. 25 -- Until this year, Habitat for Humanity
affiliates in Arizona and Colorado never felt a need to get involved in
a political fight. But in the fall they jumped into a battle against a
seemingly unlikely foe: the environmental movement.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In one of the most far-reaching efforts yet to curb suburban sprawl,
ballot initiatives in both states proposed giving voters an
unprecedented level of power to designate wide swaths of land off limits
to new housing.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Officials with Habitat, which builds low-income housing for needy
families, feared that the measures would drive up the cost of land and
''basically shut down our ability to acquire land and lots for growth,''
said Chris Wolf, the organization's director in Phoenix. So the Habitat
affiliates joined with developers to oppose the initiatives; in
Colorado, opponents even made a television commercial highlighting
Habitat's objections.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Nobody argues in favor of suburban congestion. But increasingly the
debate over sprawl has turned to whether laws intended to fight it are
playing a role in driving up housing prices, at a time when housing
affordability in many parts of the country has dipped to its lowest
level in almost a decade.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The success of anti-sprawl efforts is evident in the increasing
number of communities that have adopted measures like low-density
zoning, moratoriums on building permits or voter-approved growth
boundaries. Although the Arizona and Colorado initiatives were defeated
last month, many similar local proposals in California passed, and
battles over anti-sprawl laws continue to rage in suburbs outside
Washington, Atlanta, Dallas and other big cities.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Although the battles have been concentrated in the rapidly growing
South and West, sprawl has been a concern in the densely populated
Northeast as well. Only two years ago voters in New Jersey approved
borrowing $1 billion to help preserve about a million acres of farmland
and woodland.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
As anti-sprawl measures proliferate, developers have enlisted
affordable-housing advocates to promote the view that the restrictions
make higher home prices inevitable, in effect amounting to a tax on
prospective home buyers that hits the working and middle classes
hardest.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''One of the unintentional byproducts of efforts to control sprawl is
to restrict the amount of land available for housing,'' said Nicolas P.
Retsinas, a former Clinton administration housing official who is
director of the Joint Center for Housing Studies, at Harvard University.
''When you restrict supply in the face of increased demand, what a
surprise! Prices go up.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Efforts to limit construction, critics say, can affect all types of
housing, from apartments to mansions. Builders and other opponents
contend that even when the limits mainly affect more expensive homes,
the trickle-down consequences include rising prices for more modest
housing.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But environmentalists and other supporters of growth controls say
there is little proof that such measures have any significant impact on
housing prices. Susan LeFever, director of the Rocky Mountain chapter of
the Sierra Club, notes that cities without strong growth-control laws
have seen huge run-ups in home prices, a result of the nation's economic
boom.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''It's certainly easy to pull out examples of places with growth
restrictions where the cost of housing has gone up,'' she said. ''But
it's equally easy to pull out places that don't have growth restrictions
where the cost of housing has gone up just as much.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Unless there is a recession severe enough to slow suburban
development, experts expect anti-sprawl measures to remain popular with
voters and local elected officials.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
California saw more growth-related proposals on local ballots this
year than at any other time since 1990, before the state plunged into
recession, said Bill Fulton, president of the Solimar Research Group,
public policy analysts in Ventura, Calif. During the last four years, he
said, there have been 118 slow-growth initiatives in California, nearly
twice as many as in the prior four-year period.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Most of the proposals in California this year were approved, although
a few larger ones failed, notably in San Francisco and Sonoma County.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''In an economic boom is when you see growth restrictions come
back,'' Mr. Fulton said, ''but they tend to lag behind a few years.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In King County, Wash. -- Seattle and environs -- housing costs have
soared so high that county officials recently ordered a study of whether
the state's rules restricting development outside cities was helping
drive up prices.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The ''surprising conclusion'' of the report, due out next month, is
that there is no proof the rules have more than a negligible effect on
home prices, said Ron Sims, the county executive. He attributes the jump
in housing costs to the region's tremendous prosperity and rising
incomes, noting that the housing market flattened out this year after
the Nasdaq swooned.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In Cary, N.C., though, an affluent town of nearly 100,000 outside
Raleigh, Mayor Glen Lang says home prices are already being affected by
slow-growth measures approved in the last few years.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''When you have demand and decrease supply, prices rise
dramatically,'' Mr. Lang said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Both sides of the debate point to the same example: Portland, Ore.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Development is limited outside the growth boundary that has ringed
Portland since the 1970's, and critics contend that this is why the city
has seen home prices skyrocket. According to the government's Office of
Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, average home prices in the
Portland-Vancouver, Wash., metropolitan area have risen 148 percent in
the last dozen years.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''The development controls have acted as a long-run drag on housing
supplies,'' said Gerard Mildner, an associate professor of urban studies
and planning at Portland State University. ''The desire to protect open
space and farmland has trumped people's concerns about housing
affordability.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Defenders of the Portland boundary, however, note that cities without
similar growth controls have also seen steep price increases over the
same period, including a 128 percent rise in Denver and a 116 percent
rise in Salt Lake City-Ogden, Utah.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A study published this summer in the journal Contemporary Economic
Policy concluded that while the Portland growth boundary ''has likely
imposed upward pressure on prices, the results indicate that the effect
has been fairly modest,'' most likely less than $10,000 for a typical
home. Higher land prices have been offset by a trend toward smaller lots
and other elements of higher-density housing, said one of the study's
authors, Eban Goodstein, an economics professor at Lewis and Clark
College in Portland.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The debate over growth controls is made all the more intense because
of the unequal way the nation's long economic boom has treated
Americans. While the last decade has created tremendous wealth, many
people --teachers, police officers, nurses and many others in
middle-class jobs -- have watched the cost of housing rise faster than
their incomes.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The median price for a single-family home rose about 45 percent
during the 1990's, according to the National Association of Realtors.
For the wealthiest fifth of American families, that was no problem, as
their mean incomes rose 57 percent during that time, according to the
Census Bureau.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But the incomes of most other families failed to keep pace with
housing prices. The least affluent two-fifths of American families, for
example, saw their incomes grow just 35 percent.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
While the hottest housing markets have cooled recently -- prices fell
slightly in the San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle and Portland during the
third quarter, according to the National Association of Realtors --
there has been no letup in much of the rest of the country. Prices rose
5 percent in the Midwest and 4 percent in the South during the quarter.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In the last decade, the rise in home prices has been offset somewhat
by lower mortgage rates. But during the third quarter, housing
affordability reached its worst level since 1992. (Affordability should
improve in the fourth quarter, as rates have dropped a good bit since
the summer.) Some experts are concerned that the drop in affordability
will slow recent gains in the percentage of American families who own
their own homes -- advances that have resulted partly from loans made on
such less-restrictive terms as smaller down payments.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
And concerns about affordability extend to renters: a study issued
this year by the Department of Housing and Urban Development found that
5.4 million renter families either spent more than half their income on
rent or lived in ''severely inadequate'' housing in 1997.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In Congress, developers have used the affordability issue to seek
relief from restrictions on construction. But while builders argue that
excessive growth controls can hurt the local economy, some local elected
officials say there is also an economic danger in not doing enough to
preserve natural amenities.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''If you're going to manage growth, you can't kill the goose that
laid the golden egg,'' said Kirk Watson, the mayor here in Austin, where
home prices have soared during the technology boom. Much of the credit
for Austin's boom belongs to the city's beautiful rolling hills and
other natural features, which have helped attract a talented labor
force, the mayor said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''The new economic paradigm is about the knowledge economy, and that
is always going to follow the quality of life,'' Mr. Watson said. ''Part
of managing this boom and growth is preserving what the knowledge
economy was looking for in the first place.''

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
After a quarter of a century in which community opposition, lack of
government financing and other obstacles thwarted the development of
three prime patches at the edge of  downtown Brooklyn, New York State
moved yesterday to spur housing and retail projects on the sites.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
State officials invited proposals from developers to buy and build on
one of the sites, which now contain parking lots. Under bidding
guidelines, projects must conform to criteria that community groups have
called for to preserve the scale and character of the adjacent,
brownstone-rich Boerum Hill neighborhood.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Boerum Hill is one of the districts forming a so-called brownstone
belt around much of downtown Brooklyn's bustling commercial core.  Some
of the opponents of past proposals for the sites, originally part of an
urban renewal project, contended that the previous planned developments
would encroach on Boerum Hill's largely low-rise residential character.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Empire State Development Corporation, which with a predecessor
agency has owned the sites since 1974, issued a request for proposals
yesterday from developers interested in building housing and stores on
the smallest of the three sites, while adhering to restrictions that
include a maximum building height of 140 feet, about 14 stories.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The site, 18,000 square feet fronting on Smith Street from Atlantic
Avenue to State Street, is much smaller than the two other sites, for
which the state agency's officials said they would probably seek
purchase and development proposals next spring.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The officials said guidelines on building height and other
characteristics were still being developed for those two sites, which
total 160,000 square feet. One almost entirely fills the block bounded
by Smith, Schermerhorn, Hoyt and State Streets. The other fills most of
the block bounded by Hoyt, Schermerhorn, Bond and State Streets.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
All the sites have been leased as parking lots since 1977, supposedly
until long-term plans could be adopted. Over the years, proposals for
housing fell by the wayside as opponents argued over the size of
projects or over plans for subsidized housing, and as financing from
government subsidy programs dried up. One proposal that went nowhere
called for dormitory buildings for students at colleges in the area.
Another called for a new courthouse at one site.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Two years ago, the borough president, Howard Golden, formed a task
force of representatives of community groups and the local community
board to recommend development guidelines for the sites. These
guidelines have been incorporated into the request for proposals, Mr.
Golden said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development
Corporation, said that while the agency was ''looking to get a market
price'' for the sites and to return the property to the tax rolls, the
agency also wanted a ''development acceptable to the community.'' He
said a candidate's experience and access to financing would also be
major considerations in selecting a bidder.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
While government housing subsidies will not be involved, he said, his
agency was seeking to encourage the construction of housing that would
be ''affordable to most people.'' Once a development company is
selected, its plan would be subject to approvals by the City Planning
Commission and the City Council.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Although the area is already starved for parking spaces, the request
for proposals does not include a garage, to make up for the spaces to be
lost when the first site is developed. Mr. Gargano said he would
encourage more use of mass transit to travel to the area.

State Proposals Will Decide The Pace of Construction
</span>
</div><div class="author">
By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

</div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Across the nation voters will decide today whether to enact
anti-sprawl laws in hundreds of referendums that will show how far
residents of fast-growing regions are willing to go to slow the pace of
construction in the suburbs.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Statewide measures in Arizona and Colorado are the most prominent
responses yet to residents' concerns in places like Denver and Phoenix
that the quality of life is being harmed by congestion and crowding
caused by rapid construction of subdivisions, shopping malls and other
suburban development. At the local level across much of the nation,
efforts to limit sprawl have already picked up strong momentum, with
some communities implementing moratoriums on building permits or using
other tactics to halt growth.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Hundreds of antigrowth proposals are on local ballots across the
nation, including measures that could slow the pace of development in
parts of California.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In 23 states there are at least 33 other statewide growth-related
initiatives, including many calling for transportation improvements,
said Phyllis Myers, president of State Resource Strategies, a consulting
firm in Washington that just finished a report for the Brookings
Institution on growth-control ballot proposals.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
As recently as September, polls showed that the proposals in Arizona
and Colorado enjoyed strong voter support. But business groups, led by
the building and construction companies which stand to lose the most
financially if the antigrowth initiatives pass, have poured more than $4
million in Arizona, and close to $6 million in Colorado, into television
commercials and other efforts to defeat the measures.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
That spending, as well as opposition from advocacy groups including
Habitat for Humanity, which is concerned that the proposals could cause
housing prices to jump, appears to have turned the tide in Colorado,
where recent polls indicate that most voters now oppose the plan. In
Arizona, both sides say they believe that most residents now oppose the
initiative.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Among other things, both statewide proposals would require many towns
to create growth boundaries approved by voters. New development outside
the boundaries would be sharply limited, and any changes to allow
significant new growth outside those confines could occur only with new
voter approval.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The initiatives are the most wide-ranging growth-control measures
ever proposed on a statewide ballot, and they would give residents
unprecedented direct power over new development, Ms. Myers said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Supporters contend that the voter approvals will serve as a check
against the power of the building and construction industries to lobby
for favorable regulations, but critics say the measures will sharply
slow new development, hurt the regional economy and cause home prices to
soar.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Businesses fear that the proposals would make it harder for employees
to find reasonably priced housing, while housing groups, who are already
having trouble coping with rising costs for land, worry that the
measures will further worsen shortages of cheaper housing.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
This is the first time in 21 years Habitat for Humanity's affiliates
in Colorado have taken a position on any political issue there, said
Lori Vaclavik, executive director for Habitat for Humanity of Metro
Denver.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''It is extremely rare for us to do this,'' Ms. Vaclavik said, ''and
we only did so because we feel this amendment so threatens our mission
and the future of affordable housing in Colorado.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The environmental groups that have played a major role in getting
the initiatives on the ballot say fears of higher housing costs are
overblown. Growth restrictions do play a role in higher housing costs,
but other factors have a bigger impact, said Deron Lovaas, a Sierra Club
official who is helping coordinate the anti-sprawl initiatives.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Development has spiraled out of control in many Western regions,
including in Colorado and Arizona, Mr. Lovaas said, because they ''have
been growing at a phenomenal rate, coupled with a very libertarian
system of government and land use.'' Mr. Lovaas called this year's
election a watershed for these sorts of issues and said he hoped strong
support at the ballot box would encourage legislators in other states to
take steps to control growth.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Noting that the Arizona and Colorado proposals -- and initiatives in
other places -- were the result of citizen petitions, Ms. Myers of State
Resource Strategies said pressure for such referendums had been growing
because residents felt that lawmakers were not doing enough.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''They reflect years of frustration and lots of debate, and depending
on who you are, action or inaction on these issues'' by state
legislators, she said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Regardless of how the votes go on Tuesday, Ms. Myers added, ''the
political and elected leaders have gotten the message of how important
these issues are to voters.''

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Census Bureau reported that median household income rose in 1999
to top $40,000, the fifth consecutive annual increase. The increase was
fueled by relatively large increases in household incomes for the poor:
11.8 percent of the population was living below the poverty line,
defined as $17,029 for a family of four, the lowest poverty rate since
1979. More than 2.2 million fewer people were considered poor last year,
and 81 percent of that decline occurred in inner cities, suggesting that
prosperity has begun to trickle down.   Steven A. Holmes

Sales of Existing Homes Increased 9.3% in August

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON, Sept. 25 -- Cheaper borrowing costs encouraged Americans
to snap up existing homes in August, giving sales their biggest lift in
14 months. But economists said the rebound would not deter the Federal
Reserve from leaving interest rates unchanged at its meeting next week.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The National Association of Realtors reported today that sales of
previously occupied homes shot up by a surprising 9.3 percent last month
to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.27 million.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Mortgage rates came down, which make houses more affordable, plus
August is a big home-buying month; people try to get settled before
school starts,'' said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist for the PNC
Financial Services Group.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In August, the average interest rate on a fixed-rate 30-year mortgage
was 8.03 percent, down from 8.15 percent in July. But that was higher
than the 7.94 percent rate in August 1999. Since August, 30-year rates
have edged down. They stood at 7.90 percent last week.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Federal Reserve has increased interest rates six times over the
last 15 months to slow the economy and keep inflation under control. A
spate of other economic reports shows that the Fed's rate increases are
working to moderate economic growth and that has helped to ease mortgage
rates.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Against this backdrop, analysts predicted that the Fed would leave
interest rates alone not only on Oct. 3 but also for the rest of this
year.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
August's big increase came after existing-home sales plummeted 9.2
percent in July.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
By region, the West posted the biggest gain, with sales rising 16.3
percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.43 million in August.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In the Midwest, sales rose 10.6 percent, to a rate of 1.15 million
units. They grew 5.8 percent in the South, to a rate of 2.01 million,
and sales went up 4.6 percent in the Northeast, to a rate of 680,000.

New Home Construction Rises 0.3%

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON, Sept. 19 -- Construction of new homes increased in August
for the first time in four months as lower mortgage rates renewed
interest from buyers.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Housing starts rose 0.3 percent last month, to an annual rate of 1.53
million units, after falling 2.9 percent in July, the Commerce
Department said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The increase in August came after declines in five of the previous
six months, as mortgage rates climbed to a five-year high in May. Rates
on 30-year fixed mortgages fell in the last four months and have
averaged 7.93 percent in September, the lowest this year.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
As a result, mortgage applications rose this month to the highest
level since the week the Federal Reserve started raising interest rates
in mid-1999. ''It looks as if the worst is behind us'' for the housing
industry, said Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors in
Holland, Pa.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
That suggests housing will help sustain the economic expansion, which
is now in a record 10th year. ''It seems as if the housing market has
been able to pull off a soft landing,'' Mr. Naroff said, just the sort
of slowdown for the economy as a whole that Fed policy makers have been
seeking.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Residential construction is on course this year to total 1.62 million
units, which would match the number of houses built in 1998. That was
the second-best year -- after 1999 -- for builders during the current
expansion.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The rebound in construction comes after an increase in sales of new
single-family homes in July to the fastest pace in four months.
Construction of single-family homes rose 4.6 percent in August to the
highest level since April. Permits for construction on new houses rose
2.1 percent last month, the first increase since March, suggesting a
further pickup in home building.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Construction of apartments and other multifamily housing fell 15.9
percent last month after a 6.7 percent drop in July. Permits plunged for
multifamily homes.

Real Estate Market Is Tough Even for a Kingdom

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In the annals of relations between the West and Bhutan, a remote
Buddhist kingdom in the Himalayas, a vote yesterday by the Manhattan
Borough Board may not rank up there with the opening of that country to
tourists in 1974 or the debut of its first television network last year.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But after a nearly three-year struggle that drew the Manhattan board
and the Clinton administration into a human rights debate, the isolated
country won permission yesterday to buy a Midtown Manhattan town house
that will serve as the permanent home of its mission to the United
Nations.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Bhutan, a rugged country of an estimated 660,000 residents that is
bordered by China to the north and India to the south, has operated its
only diplomatic office in the Western Hemisphere out of rented space at
2 United Nations Plaza since it joined the United Nations in 1971. In an
effort to expand its presence and eliminate a skyrocketing rent bill, in
1997 it bid for the right to buy a five-story town house at 763 First
Avenue (42nd Street), across the street from the United Nations.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
It paid a deposit on the city-owned property and won approval from
the local community board, but when it came time for the Manhattan
Borough Board to vote on the $2.3 million sale, the protracted human
rights debate began.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Led by City Councilman Stanley E. Michels, the board refused to
approve the sale, citing Bhutan's treatment of settlers from Nepal and
India a decade ago. Thousands of them were forced to leave Bhutan for
refugee camps set up in Nepal. The building itself is of particular
significance, Mr. Michels said, because its southern exterior is the
so-called Isaiah Wall, where a biblical quotation urges nations to
''beat their swords into plowshares.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''We did not get involved voluntarily,'' said Mr. Michels, who serves
on the borough board with other Council members and officials from
Manhattan. ''They asked us to get involved because we have to approve
the sale of the city building. I was not about to approve of their human
conduct, as of two years ago.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Bhutan, the last surviving Himalayan Buddhist monarchy, has long been
protective of its borders and traditional ways. Serfdom did not become
illegal until 1958. The international news media were not allowed into
the country until 1974.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The purchase of the building reflects Bhutan's gradual drive to
broaden its connections with the outside world, said Om Pradhan, the
Bhutanese ambassador to the United Nations. ''If we are settled down, if
we can have a more established mission, we will be able to play an
ongoing and more meaningful role in international affairs,'' Mr. Pradhan
said yesterday.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The borough board's refusal to approve the sale, first in September
1998 and again in August 1999, initially drew little attention. But it
gradually drew together unlikely allies in protest, including the
Clinton administration and the United Nations Development Corporation, a
nonprofit agency, both of which have argued that the Manhattan board
needed a foreign affairs tutorial of sorts.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Richard C. Holbrooke, the United States representative to the United
Nations, wrote to the city in May, urging it to approve the sale. He
cited a decision by the Bhutanese government in 1999 to grant pardons to
200 prisoners, including some considered by human rights groups to be
political detainees. Negotiations are also under way to decide what
should happen with 100,000 refugees in Nepalese camps who seek
permission to return to Bhutan, he said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Based on my observations, and compared to what I have seen in
numerous other countries, I would say that Bhutan is clearly a country
where there is peace and respect for people, in sharp contrast to other
countries that despite their problems, have not been subject to such
problems in New York,'' Mr. Holbrooke wrote in his letter to the city,
citing his own visit to Bhutan in 1996.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The United Nations Development Corporation, which is controlled
largely by the Giuliani administration, prepared to sue Mr. Michels and
other City Council members who had opposed the sale. The corporation
cited the Constitution in contending that the board has no right to
intervene in international affairs, particularly given the corporation's
belief that the board was misreading Bhutan's human rights record.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The matter was resolved yesterday by a unanimous vote after Mr.
Michels; C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president; and other
board members who had objected to the sale decided that Bhutan had made
progress toward addressing what they had called human rights abuses. The
sale of the building is expected to be completed this week.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Yesterday, those who had opposed the sale portrayed the situation as
a modest foreign affairs victory for the United States. ''Because of the
intervention of the Manhattan Borough Board, the Bhutanese government
has recognized the importance of human rights to the United States and
the international community,'' said a statement by Ms. Fields.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Pradhan laughed when told of the statement. ''If they want to
take the credit, I have no objection, but how can it be true?'' he said.
''This has nothing to do with the purchase of the building.''

Wetlands in City's Watershed Fall Under New Federal Controls

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The federal government has announced tougher restrictions on building
in wetlands within the New York City watershed.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The new rules, involving wetlands as small as one-tenth of an acre
east of the Hudson River, will mainly affect Westchester, Putnam and
Dutchess Counties, said Joseph J. Seebode, an official with the Army
Corps of Engineers.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The new rules require developers to obtain federal permits for any
new construction projects, including individual homes, in wetlands.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Tiny pieces of wetlands, added together, can contribute to a region's
water quality, said Jeffrey Odefey of Riverkeeper, a Hudson River
environmental organization. ''These are critical little pieces,'' he
said. ''There are lots of them, and together they provide filtration and
flood control. They may seem like a puddle in somebody's backyard, but
if it's near stream headwaters, it can affect the quality of the
drinking water system.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Environmental organizations and the New York City Council have been
lobbying for stronger federal protection of wetlands around the 1,969
square miles of watershed for months.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In the vast watershed region west of the Hudson River, federal
regulations, passed last spring and tougher than previous ones, will
continue to apply.

Acre by Acre, an Old Family Farm Fades Away

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
NORTH CALDWELL, N.J., Sept. 1 -- If you stand in the middle of James
Matarazzo's eggplant patch and gaze up toward his grandfather's
farmhouse, which dates to the 1840's, you can almost imagine what life
was like here before the split level and the strip mall turned New
Jersey into the paradigm of American-style sprawl.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But without a good set of blinders, there's no missing the newly
built McMansions that surround Matarazzo Farms, nearly 80 of them, all
plunked down on land that the family has sold over the years.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Matarazzo grins as he gestures toward one subdivision, Oyster
Pond, where million-dollar homes have been set around a former livestock
watering hole. ''People put docks on it,'' he says with a bittersweet
laugh. Of course, with land selling at $300,000 for half an acre these
days, the laugh is more sweet than bitter.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Of the original 103 acres that Mr. Matarazzo's grandfather, who
emigrated from Italy, cleared in 1921, only 23 are still growing
produce.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
It's a wonder that Matarazzo Farms, sitting in western Essex County,
one of the most densely settled places in the nation's most thickly
populated state, exists at all. The United States Department of
Agriculture counted 21 farms in the county in 1997, but Mr. Matarazzo
says all but 2 have since given way to development.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Statewide, despite an ambitious farm preservation program, more than
50,000 acres of farmland have been lost in the last decade.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Whenever we have a sluggish season, we sell off a few more acres,''
Mr. Matarazzo explains. ''The land prices make it too tempting.'' The
most recent parcel he sold, where cauliflower, broccoli and corn once
grew, is awaiting the construction of seven homes.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
For now, he's holding on to the rest. His 88-year-old father, Joe,
still rides the tractor; his wife and sister run the produce stand; and
at 54, Mr. Matarazzo figures he has a few more seasons left in him.
''I'll probably die doing this,'' he says, lighting his pipe, a Panama
hat shading his eyes.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
His three children work in air-conditioned offices and hate to rise
with the sun, so Mr. Matarazzo has no illusions about the farm's
long-term future. Every month or so, a land-craving developer or two
stop by and make an offer. Mr. Matarazzo usually tells them to come back
another day. ''Every time I think of selling, I get a knot in my
stomach,'' he says, sorting through a bin of tomatoes, some of them
spotty from the overabundance of rain.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Despite the odd complaint about rotting produce or noisy irrigation
equipment, most residents prize the farm for its fresh produce, bucolic
vistas and autumnal hayrides, which draw neighborhood children. Maria
Rampinelli, a local real estate broker, said she liked the idea of using
more land for more houses, but would hate to see all of it go. ''You
know, there's absolutely nothing for sale here,'' she said of the
housing market. ''But then again, I'd really miss their bread-and-butter
corn.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
When he's not thinking about selling, Mr. Matarazzo has more mundane
worries: fiendish weather, sagging crop prices and voracious deer. As
the amount of open space here shrinks, the remaining deer are becoming
hungrier, peskier and less fearful. Folk remedies like human hair, bars
of soap and a pack of barking dogs have all failed to keep them out. His
latest foil, an eight-foot-tall fence costing $5,000, has been a bust.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''I've seen them hop right over with little effort,'' he says,
pointing out rows of ravaged cucumbers, corn and arugula leaves. ''We
lose more stuff to the deer than we sell.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
With his slightly frayed chinos, well-trimmed beard and philosophical
musings, Mr. Matarazzo doesn't look the part of the tobacco-chewing,
weatherworn yeoman. Like his father before him, he is the mayor of North
Caldwell, a part-time job he has held for 14 years. ''I guess I keep
getting re-elected because everyone always knows where to find me if
they have a problem,'' he says.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Matarazzo never planned to be a farmer. The long hours and the
summer vacations he spent hunched over in the sun as a teenager
convinced him that he was meant for another vocation. The summer after
he graduated from Villanova University with plans to become a
sociologist, Mr. Matarazzo returned home to make some pocket money.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
He never left.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''I really wanted to get away from this,'' he says, yanking a small
cucumber from the vine and popping it into his mouth. ''I guess I could
never get used to the idea of working indoors day in, day out. I can't
imagine having to go outside to have a smoke.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Of course, there are downsides to the agricultural life. He rarely
takes a day off, and on the few occasions that he and his wife, Pat,
have ventured to Cancun or Boca Raton for a week, he found himself
distracted by the Weather Channel. ''I never really relax when I'm not
here,'' he says.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Every once in a while, on a Wednesday afternoon, he drives the 17
miles to New York City. After buying cigars, he stops at the Pierre
Hotel on Fifth Avenue for a martini and a game of matchsticks -- a
tradition he's maintained for 35 years. ''It's a stupid old-men's game,
but I love it anyway,'' he says.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Besides exhausting days and endless weather worries, there is another
downside to farming: dirty fingernails. But Mr. Matarazzo has found a
home-grown remedy: laundry bleach. ''If I'm rushing out for a town
meeting or to New York and I don't have time to scrub, I'll dip my
fingers in a cup of Clorox,'' he explains. ''Does the trick every time.''
</p>

Accident and a Broker's Sacrifice Help Buy a House
</span>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
DONNA WILLIAMS and Michael Lynch love their new house, the first
they've ever owned. But if not for an  elevator accident, and a real
estate broker willing to sacrifice part of his commission to make a
sale, the house might never have been theirs.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Until recently, Ms. Williams and Mr. Lynch were living in a tiny
ground-floor apartment in Long Island City, where they couldn't even
open the windows. ''Every window faced a garbage can,'' Ms. Williams
said, and the garbage always smelled. And at $720 a month, the apartment
wasn't even all that cheap.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Finally, some extra money -- very hard-earned -- came their way.
Seven years ago, when Ms. Williams was working as an executive secretary
for a Midtown company, she was taking an elevator so she could go
outside for a cigarette. The elevator malfunctioned. ''I got caught in
the doors and they crushed me,'' she said. ''It broke the bones in my
hand and my shoulder.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The accident left her with very little strength in her left arm; she
can't lift more  than four pounds, she said, less than the weight of
many purses. She was out of work for nine months getting therapy, and
lost her job. For several years, she said, she couldn't work at all.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
For the last three years, she has been a customer-service
representative for an offset printing company in Manhattan. And last
October, the lawsuit she had filed was finally settled, and she was
awarded enough money to allow her to pay off bills and set aside some
cash for a down payment.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The trouble was, when she called brokers, they all said that she and
Mr. Lynch, a plumber, didn't have enough money to buy a two-family house
in Queens, where the brokers said the prices ranged from $375,000 to
$400,000. But they didn't give up. At an open house in Jackson Heights,
they met a broker, Charles Sciberras of ReMax Today on Steinway Street
in Astoria. ''He says, 'I  really like you, and I'm going to get you a
house.' '' Ms. Williams recalled.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Not long after, he took them to a two-family brick house on 47th
Street near 30th Avenue in Astoria. ''You couldn't see the windows for
the weeds and car parts,'' Ms. Williams said. Inside it was worse. The
second floor had been nearly destroyed by a tenant who then sublet the
space to 15 people. The basement was filled with junk. And the asking
price of $360,000 meant they couldn't quite qualify for the mortgage
they would need.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
BUT despite the problems, Ms. Williams and Mr. Lynch were interested.
And Mr. Sciberras made the sale possible by reducing the amount of his
standard commission -- 6 percent of the $360,000, or $21,600, paid by
the seller -- by $5,000. In this way, the seller could receive the money
she wanted, and Ms. Williams and Mr. Lynch could qualify for the
mortgage.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''I never let a brokerage fee get in the way of a sale,'' Mr.
Sciberras said. ''I like to make a good living, but I'm in this for the
long run. When they go to sell it, who are they going to think of? Me.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
After closing in July, Ms. Williams and Mr. Lynch began spending
their nights and weekends working on the upstairs apartment, which they
plan to rent out. They scrubbed mildew that was left from a leak,
replaced wallboard where they needed to, fixed the plumbing, sanded the
floors and painted the apartment, which is now a pleasing, light-filled
space.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The only problem has been the tree in their front yard, which Ms.
Williams disliked on aesthetic grounds even before it crashed into her
front window during a storm, damaging her computer.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
If she had the money, she said, she would have it ripped out, and she
would replace it with some concrete statues and pots with plants in
them.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''I don't want a tree,'' she said. ''It belongs in Central Park.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Soon, they will start working on the downstairs apartment, which has
a small den, a bedroom and a living room with nice wood floors, and a
kitchen with room for a small table.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Once they rent out the upstairs, their monthly costs will be about
what they paid for their old place. But here, Ms. Williams said, the
garbage cans will be in the basement, and the front window of the small
den, her favorite room, will be wide open.

Renters to Owners: Low-Income Program in Debut
</span>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
SHOREHAM -- EVER since she and her teenage son, John O'Keefe, moved
into a two-bedroom ranch on Defense Hill Road here four years ago as a
tenant of the Community Development Corporation of Long Island, Carol
McGrann has longed to own her home.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''My parents owned their house, and I wanted to give my son the same
security I had,'' said Ms. McGrann, who grew up in Deer Park.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
This month she saw that wish granted. She became the first person on
Long Island -- and the first in the New York metropolitan area -- to buy
a house under the federal Section 8 Homeownership Program, whose goal is
to turn renters into homeowners.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Normally, low-income families who qualify for Section 8 vouchers pay
only 30 percent of their income for rent, minus a $480 adjustment for
each child. Anything needed above that amount is paid by the federal
government.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Under the Section 8 Homeownership Program the family still need pay
only 30 percent of its income for housing costs, but that sum can now go
toward paying off a mortgage. The Section 8 assistance is used to pay
off the monthly mortgage amount that exceeds the family's ability to
pay. To qualify for the program, the head of family must be working,
unless the recipient is elderly or disabled.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The legislation was authorized under the  Quality Housing and Work
Responsibility Act of 1998, but has been in preparation since the early
1990's as part of public housing reform legislation.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Department of Housing and Urban Development issued guidelines in
April 1999 to enable demonstration programs to get under way. Fifteen
such programs are now in operation around the country, among them the
program developed by the Community Development Corporation of Long
Island that enabled Ms. McGrann to buy her house. Final regulations will
be issued shortly, said William C. Apgar, assistant secretary of
housing.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''The pilot programs are getting a number of different models going
so that other agencies can pick and choose which combination makes sense
for the families in their area,'' he said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Community Development Corporation, whose president is Wilbur
Klatsky, is one of several administering the Section 8 program on Long
Island, serving about 1,700  of the region's 10,000 Section 8
recipients.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Hundreds of Long Island families now receiving Section 8 help could
move to  homeownership, said Marianne Garvin, the executive vice
president of the organization, whose headquarters are in Centereach. She
added that her agency's goal was to help at least 40 families do so
every 18 months.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Helping families increase their income is not enough, she said.
''What we also have to do is increase a family's wealth and increase
their asset base because that's what gets them out of poverty.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''People have this burning desire to be a homeowner,'' she said,
''and if they receive Section 8 assistance and have a job and work with
us to clear up their credit, we have the tools to help them get there.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The legislation requires that the Section 8 assistance end after 10
years, under the assumption that by then the family will have built up
not only equity in the home but also its ability to make mortgage
payments.  Most banks base mortgage loans on the borrower's ability to
repay over the life of the loan, usually 30 years.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Some banks taking part in programs elsewhere in the country are
providing first mortgages for the full amount regardless of the fact
that the borrower's income might be lower after 10 years, but willing to
take that risk, Mr. Apgar of HUD said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But under the program developed by the Community Development
Corporation, which is chartered to make loans, families will receive a
second mortgage from the Suffolk group to cover the gap between the
mortgage amount the family can qualify for based on its income and the
amount needed to buy the house. The second loan, which will be offered
at a below-market interest rate, will be repaid over 10 years out of the
family's Section 8 allotment.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Four lenders, Chase Manhattan Bank, EAB, Fleet Bank and HSBC bank,
are taking part in the Suffolk program by providing  first mortgages to
buyers.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Money for the second loans is being raised through grants and through
a line of credit  extended by Fannie Mae, the agency that  buys
mortgages from banks on the secondary market. The Neighborhood
Reinvestment Corporation has pledged $350,000 and other grants and
fund-raisers are expected to add almost $650,000. Fannie Mae's initial
involvement is a $1 million commitment at a below-market interest rate.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
THE Section 8 voucher program is a very interesting way to help
families who would otherwise be closed out of homeownership,'' said
Jackie O'Garrow, senior deputy director of Fannie Mae's New York office.
The program model being offered by the Centereach group ''is so prudent
and makes so much sense that we hope to see it replicated,'' she said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The program works as follows. Assuming a family of four has an
adjusted annual income of $34,040 ($35,000 minus the child allowance)
and is renting a three-bedroom house for $1,427 monthly -- a sum that
falls within federal guidelines -- it would be paying 30 percent of that
income, or a total of $853 a month toward the rent. The remaining $574 a
month would be paid out of the Section 8 rental assistance program.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Under the Section 8 homeownership program, the same family could now
assume payments on $120,000 in mortgages. A first mortgage of $67,051 at
8 percent interest would require a monthly payment of $492. A second
mortgage of $52,949 provided by the Community Development Corporation at
3 percent over 10 years would require monthly payments of $511, which
would be paid under the Section 8 program.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Additionally, HUD would pay $65 a month toward the family's housing
expenses because allowances are also made for utility costs when they
are not included in rent.  Thus the family would have $361 of the $853
it had originally paid for rent available for taxes, insurance and
utilities.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Although mortgages with down payments as low as 3 percent are
available, combined with closing costs they still represent a daunting
hurdle. But even though it may take a family time to accumulate the
funds, help is available.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Section 8 recipients who also enroll in the optional federal Family
Self-Sufficiency Program to receive career counseling, job training, and
budget and personal counseling can place rent that they would otherwise
have to pay if their income rises into an escrow account. When they
graduate from the program, which means they must have been working for
at least one year, that money can be withdrawn and used to buy a home.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Under its First Home Club Program, the Federal Home Loan Bank
contributes three dollars for every one dollar to savings that a
low-income family has earmarked for the  purchase of a home and
deposited in a member bank. Additionally, the Suffolk Office of
Community Development has set aside $50,000 of federal community
development money under the federal HOME program to provide up to $5,000
in downpayment assistance to a family that can match the county grant.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Victor LaBruna, a sales associate with Coach Realty in Northport, one
of several real estate offices in Suffolk that will be helping families
with their housing search, said nearly 800 homes in Suffolk are
currently listed for $135,000 and under, a price that Ms. Garvin
estimated a family of four would be able to afford.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Ms. McGrann was able to buy her home  on Defense Hill Road in
Shoreham for only $80,000 under a special offer from the Community
Development Corporation, which in 1996 purchased all 16 houses on her
street. The houses, built in the 1950's to house Army personnel assigned
to a nearby Nike air-defense missile site, had been put up for sale by
the federal government. The corporation fixed them up and rented them to
low-income families with the goal of having the tenants own the houses
after five years.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
All but two of the 16 families have succeeded in buying their homes.
But Ms. McGrann, who earns just $24,000 a year as a medical technician,
said she could not have afforded to join the other 13 buyers even at the
$80,000 purchase price were it not for the new program.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
She received a $48,000 first mortgage from EAB and a $3,000 second
mortgage from the Community Development Corporation, which will be paid
off with her Section 8 vouchers. The monthly payment on the second loan
is only $29, Ms. McGrann said, ''but sometimes a very small amount makes
a big difference because it allowed me to afford the purchase price of
the house.'' The Community Development Corporation is also reducing the
purchase amount of the Defense Hill Road homes by  $25,000 so long as
buyers remain in their houses for at least 10 years.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
JoAnn Signorelli's dream is to buy a townhouse ''with a little yard''
for herself and her 6-year-old daughter. She is now renting  an
apartment in Farmingdale, paying $775 toward the $1,070 monthly rent,
with the rest coming from Section 8 assistance.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A single mother, she joined the Family Self-Sufficiency Program two
years ago and  went back to school, receiving a bachelor of arts degree
from the State University of New York at Stony Brook that recently
enabled her to get a job as a clinical social worker. She has already
started a savings program, she said, and hopes to buy a home with the
help of the Section 8 program by next summer.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Homeownership will give my daughter and me a feeling of stability
and permanence,'' she said. ''As a single mother, it's not something I
could have achieved on my own.''

Mining for Housing Dollars in Pits of Sand

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
PLAINVIEW -- LOOKING more like a prehistoric reptile than machinery,
an excavator is hard at work on the arid slopes of a former sand mine
here on the northern service road of the Long Island Expressway, gouging
out the sand and loading it into dump trucks.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
It will take about three more months of earth moving to complete
preparations for a 370-home project called the Hamlet on Olde Oyster
Bay, which the Holiday Organization is building in a joint venture with
the Roslyn Savings Bank. The 55-acre site is just west of Round Swamp
Road.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The sand-mining operation left behind a crater 60 feet deep spreading
over 24 acres. About 1.8 million cubic yards of sand on the site will be
redistributed to provide a compact and level surface for new
construction, said Elliot Monter, Holiday's president.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Hamlet is one of three developments  under way that are taking
barren wastelands left behind by sand-mining operations and reclaiming
them for housing, among other uses. The two others are in Smithtown and
in Port Washington.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Lush grass, flowering plants and young trees surrounding a sales
office at the entrance of the Hamlet property hint at what could be
accomplished once $5 million worth of earth moving and landscaping is
completed. The housing -- clusters of attached town-house-style
buildings as well as detached single-family houses on their own lots --
sold out within three weeks of the opening of sales late in June, with
buyers making their decisions based only on renderings and a scale model
of a heavily treed site with a lake at its center.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Plainview property was formerly owned by the Town of Oyster Bay,
which had intended to use it for a municipal landfill, meanwhile leasing
it out for sand mining. In 1997, after New York State outlawed any
additional landfills on Long Island, the town decided to sell the
property and to use the money to make up for a two-year budget
shortfall.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In Smithtown, 88 acres of land that formerly contained a sand mine
and a cement plant are being redeveloped for housing and commercial
space. The parcel, on Terry Road, was assembled in 1983 by the DiCanio
Organization of Smithtown, which received town approvals for a mix of
detached and attached houses, rental apartments, stores and offices. The
project, called the Galleria, is being built in five phases, two of
which, including the commercial portion, have been completed.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In Port Washington, lush grass and wetlands already cover most of
what was once a scarred valley that had been mined for its sand for
almost a hundred years. The 460-acre property, on West Shore Road, was
also municipally owned. The Town of North Hempstead, which bought the
tract in 1988 for $33.1 million, intended to build a solid waste
incinerator.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But in 1994, a new town board, headed by May W. Newburger, who is
still the town supervisor, decided to eliminate both an eyesore and a
mounting debt by building a recreation complex that would include two
golf courses, with income from fees to be used to pay for some of the
$30 million construction cost. The town also sold off a 42-acre portion
of the property for housing, receiving $28.3 million for the parcel.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The golf courses covering 230 acres are completed, and home
construction is expected to start in the fall.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Aside from the extra earth moving that is involved, building on
former sand mines poses no particular construction problems, said Larry
Gargano, whose Greenview Properties development company in Bay Shore is
building 187 town houses on the Smithtown site in a joint venture with
DiCanio. ''You have three possible scenarios on Long Island,'' he said.
''You have sand, which is good because it has good drainage; clay, which
is bad; and bog, which is even worse. So sand is what you hope to build
on.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Good drainage is also critical to bringing these barren wastelands
back to life, said Richard B. Ignatow of Huntington, the landscape
architect for the Galleria project.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Slopes left behind by sand mining can be stabilized by the planting
of seedlings or by spraying with a mixture of grass seed, water and
fertilizer. Flat areas are also sprayed with the mixture, which is
applied over topsoil. ''It takes money and a lot of topsoil, but these
properties can be restored,'' Mr. Ignatow said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
AT the Hamlet at Olde Oyster Bay, Holiday is using the deepest point
of the  crater left behind by the sand-mining operation to create a
4.5-acre lake. ''Rather than look at the hole as a negative, our
approach was, it exists, so how do we use it in a positive manner and to
our advantage,'' Mr. Monter, the president of Holiday, said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The lake will be the focal point of the development, not only
providing a visual amenity but also collecting rainwater runoff so that
it can filter back into the ground.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Wayne Villavaso of West Palm Beach, Fla., the landscape architect,
said the theme of the Hamlet development was to recreate the look of a
typical waterfront village in Oyster Bay, so he also incorporated a
series of small village greens into his design to help mitigate the
density of the housing.  Several of the attached buildings will also
back up to wooded areas with walking paths.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The entrance to the development will  have a nautical theme, with a
gatehouse designed to look like a lighthouse overlooking ponds,
fountains and waterfalls.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
House prices at the Hamlet started at $275,000 for a two-bedroom,
1,500-square-foot first-floor condominium apartment in a two-story town
house and ranged up to $600,000 for a 3,900-square-foot 5-bedroom
detached house on a 50-foot-by-115-foot lot. The first residents will
move in by spring.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
At the Galleria in Smithtown, almost half of the 88-acre site is in
its original barren state because construction is still under way on 33
acres where the 187 town houses are being built. That phase of the
development is called Windcrest.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
However, a 312-unit apartment complex, Avalon Commons, that is owned
and operated by AvalonBay Communities of Alexandria, Va., was completed
in 1996, and sod, shrubs and flowers flourish on what used to be bare
sand covering 21 acres.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The first lawns are also taking root in front of 29 detached houses
that are being completed on a 11.5-acre portion of the site by the
DiCanio and Greenview partnership.  That phase, called Coventry Village,
is sold out. Prices of the 72 town houses still available at Windcrest
range from $229,000 for a 1,500-square-foot two-bedroom dwelling to
$319,000 for one with three bedrooms and 2,100 square feet. Also not yet
completed is another section of detached houses. These 13 four-bedroom
dwellings, six of which are sold, are being built on a high point of the
former sand mine by Mountain Brook Homes of Huntington, which bought 10
acres from DiCanio in February 1999. Prices range from $380,000 to
$460,000.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Construction of the first houses at the Port Washington site is
expected to start by  October. The site's 42 acres, occupying a high
point of the former sand mine, were originally bought by Harbor Ridge
Associates of Manhattan, but the company subsequently sold off 33 acres
to Bernard Janowitz Construction, a Roslyn Heights developer, whose
financial partner is Westbrook Partners of Manhattan.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
On its remaining nine acres, Harbor Ridge will be building a
six-story building with 324 co-op apartments for people 62 and over who
want to live independently but who also want the assurance that they can
receive long-term care in the same building if needed. A wing of the
apartment building containing 76 additional residences has been set
aside for a section that can provide assisted living and skilled nursing
care.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Long-term care insurance is included in the monthly maintenance
residents pay, which ranges from $2,700 on a 750-square-foot one-bedroom
apartment selling for $270,000, to $5,000 monthly for 2,500-square-foot
penthouse selling for $1.2 million.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The life care component of the project was approved by New York State
in March, said David A. Pearson, the president of Harbor Ridge. At least
half of the units must be under contract before construction can start
''and we are approaching that number at a nice pace,'' he said, adding
that he hoped to start building before the end of the year.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The remaining 33 acres of the former sand mine will be developed as a
mix of housing ranging from condominium apartments to single-family
detached homes. Bernard M. Janowitz, the developer, said he could not
discuss prices until an offering plan had been accepted for filing by
the state attorney general other than to say it would be ''luxury
housing.'' Age restrictions require one family member to be at least 55.
Mr. Janowitz said. He said he hoped to start both sales and construction
by October.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The former sand mine is otherwise flourishing. On a recent sunny
afternoon, the fairways of the two golf courses were crowded with
players. Osprey, tern and blue heron have been spotted in the wetland
areas, said Mrs. Newburger, the North Hempstead town supervisor.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''We have done two things,'' she said. ''We have diminished a huge
debt and we have transformed a desolate useless desert area into a
self-sustaining wonderful garden-like environment that gives our
residents a place of enjoyment.''

Using the Internet to Lower Costs and Sell Houses

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
IT didn't take long for DeLanee J. Collins to decide to sell her
house in Tinton Falls through an Internet brokerage company rather than
a traditional one. For the technologically savvy Ms. Collins the reason
was simple: to save money.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
That was the promise of the company she used, Your Home Direct.com,
based in West Long Branch. The company began operations in March under
the premise that by linking the Internet with a range of real estate
services it could make the process of buying and selling a home more
efficient and less costly.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Depending on the services provided through its licensed real estate
agents under three different sales programs, Your Home Direct charges 2
to 3.9 percent of the sales price. This compares with the 6 percent
commission that has become the industry standard for traditional
brokerage companies. The Web addresses for Your Home Direct are
 www.yhd.com [http://www.yhd.com/]
or yourhome direct.com.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Ms. Collins listed her home with Your Home Direct after hearing its
ad on the radio and calling for a demonstration. ''It seemed like a
win-win situation,'' Ms. Collins said, without ''any greater risk than I
would have with a traditional brokerage.'' Ms. Collins, 36, a single
parent with two sons, is an international project manager at Avaya
Communications in Holmdel, formerly Lucent Technologies
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Jason and Jennifer Walk bought Ms. Collins's contemporary with three
bedrooms and a loft. ''I saw a virtual tour of the house and fell in
love with it,'' Mr. Walk said. ''From my perspective I wasn't gaining or
losing anything by buying this way.''
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
There are a handful of traditional discount brokerages in New Jersey,
including Lake Realty in Brick. Since the agency's founding in 1993,
Sherif Selim, the owner, said he had been charging commissions ranging
from 0.75 percent to 3.75 percent to sellers in Ocean and Monmouth
Counties.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But Your Home Direct bills itself as the first full-service licensed
Internet-based company in the state.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Internet real estate sites have been around for several years and
have evolved from offering bare-bones property listings to providing
lots of features, including data on neighborhoods as well as links to
lenders and house inspectors. While such sites can save home buyers and
sellers time by enabling them to narrow their search for houses and
services online, many ultimately steered prospective buyers to
traditional brokerage companies.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
With Your Home Direct, Glenn E. Cohen, a 38-year-old lawyer, has
expanded the concept of e-brokerage by combining the Internet's
time-saving features with flesh-and-blood brokers. Earlier, Mr. Cohen
worked for his family's brokerage company in Shrewsbury, selling
subdivision sites to developers.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Initially backed by $2.8 million from investors, including the
state's largest home builder, K. Hovnanian Enterprises of Red Bank, Your
Home Direct secured an additional $8 million in venture capital and
established five offices in the state. It has 70 employees, 50 of them
licensed agents. Since it started, the company has listed about 1,000
houses, mostly resales but a few new homes, Mr. Cohen said. Buyers have
signed contracts on 275 and closed on 85, he said.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The company says its fees are low because its overhead is low, its
brokers spend far fewer hours than conventional brokers in showing
property, and they work on a salaried rather than on a commission basis.
They don't attend closings or home inspections, as many conventional
brokers do, and in some cases they don't accompany the buyer on visits
to the houses. In May the company added a mortgage subsidiary, yhd
Capital.com.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Conventional brokers questions whether services like Your Home Direct
maintain large enough staffs of knowledgeable brokers to keep customers
up-to-date about local market conditions. The suggestion is that a
conventional broker might be able to get a better price for the seller.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Your Home Direct replies that the time-saving feature of the Internet
used in combination with real brokers serves customers well. ''Without
the efficiency of the Internet we don't exist, and without the services
we don't exist,'' Mr. Cohen said.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
THE company joins a growing number of e-brokerage companies that have
sprung up across the nation in the last two years as a ''bricks and
clicks'' alternative to the conventional ''bricks and mortar'' way of
buying and selling homes.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Others include zipRealty.com in Berkeley, Calif.; eRealty.com in
Houston; and Homebytes in Richmond, Va. Last month, Homebytes became the
first e-brokerage company to be licensed in every state; it intends to
be fully operational in New Jersey by the end of September.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
While some companies like Your Home Direct offer a range of fees
based on the services the sellers want, others charge a set price.
Homebytes, for instance, charges sellers a one-time fee of $499, which
includes listing the home on the local Multiple Listing Service, the
bible of available properties, and establishing a sales price. The
company's agents also advise sellers on how to sell their houses via
telephone and the Internet.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Referring to discount e-brokerage companies generally, Dennis R.
Cronk, the president of the National Association of Realtors in
Washington, said: ''If they fit some consumers' needs, they will be
utilized. But in the past discount brokerages have never reached any
level of success in the business.''
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Walter Baczkowski Jr., the executive vice president of the New Jersey
Association of Realtors in Edison, said that a ''good real estate market
hides many evils.'' The test ''is how well these business models can
withstand a bad economy,'' he said, adding that ''there is only so much
venture capital to go around.'
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Under each of Your Home Direct's three sales programs it offers such
basic services as listing the houses, with digital pictures and
computerized tours on real estate Web sites, and marketing the houses
through tradition print advertisements and ''for sale'' signs. The
company prequalifies all prospective buyers and provides online links to
a network of professionals.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The lowest commission Your Home Direct charges in 2 percent. For
that, sellers get the basic listing services but must show their homes
themselves.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
For a 3 percent percent commission, an agent will provide the seller
with a marketing plan and with help on setting a realistic price, will
show the house and will handle all negotiations.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
For a 3.9 percent commission the company will also list the home with
the local Multiple Listing Service. Under this plan if the house is sold
through the buyer's broker, that broker gets 2.5 percent of the 3.9
percent commission; the Your Home Direct agent gets the remaining 1.3
percent.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
To sell her Tinton Falls house, Ms. Collins selected the 3 percent
plan, and the house was shown to five prospective buyers, including the
Walks. After negotiating to have some minor repairs done, the Walks
offered to pay Ms. Collins's full asking price of $229,900. She, in
turn, paid Your Home Direct a $6,897 commission, compared with the
$13,794 she would have paid a broker charging the standard 6 percent.
''Along with the savings,'' Ms. Collins said, ''it was a relatively
hassle-free experience.''
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A recent survey of 20,000 buyers conducted by the National
Association of Realtors  showed that 37 percent of the home shoppers
used the Internet as ''as search tool,'' up from 18 percent in 1997 and
from 2 percent in 1995, said Mr. Gronk, the group's president. But he
added that 49 percent of the respondents said they actually found their
homes through a local Multiple Listing Service, compared with 4 percent
who found their homes through the Internet.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''The industry is changing, and Realtors have to prove they add
value,'' Mr. Gronk said. ''But today and in the past, sellers have
migrated to full-service real estate brokerages.'' If commissions ''are
ridiculously low, they ultimately must ask, 'What am I getting and not
getting,' '' he said.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But Nick Karris, a real estate analyst for Gomez Advisors, an
Internet research firm in Lincoln, Mass., said that e-brokerage
companies are changing the way business is done.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''These are not fly-by-night companies that just put up fancy Web
sites,'' he said.  The consumer ''is no longer at the mercy'' of the
traditional real estate agent or of the traditional 6 percent sales
commission.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Executives at many established real estate firms in New Jersey
acknowledged that by challenging the conventional pricing of brokerage
services, e-brokerage companies like Your Home Direct would appeal to
some but certainly not all consumers.
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''There are certain things that can't be done unless Realtors rub
elbows with buyers and sellers in the field,'' said Jack Waters, a
regional vice president, in the Matawan office, of Weichert Realtors,
one of the state's largest residential brokerage companies. ''That's
where the business is done, not on a laptop.''
 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
For his part, Mr. Cohen said that Your Home Direct would not overtake
traditional full-service real estate companies. ''But we will take a
piece of the market,'' he said.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A conference on the possibilities for expanding home ownership in New
York City and across the country is scheduled for Sept. 7 at the New
York University School of Law.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Spurred by the strong economy, innovative lending practices and
public-private partnerships to create affordable housing, ''home
ownership in the United States has reached record levels in recent
years,'' said Michael Schill, director of the N.Y.U. law school's Center
for Real Estate and Urban Policy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Yet, there remains a large number of Americans who aspire to become
home owners,'' Professor Schill said, ''and ownership rates among some
racial and minority groups and immigrants are much lower than those of
white, native-born households.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The conference, sponsored by the N.Y.U. center, the Rutgers
University Center for Urban Policy and the Fannie Mae Foundation, will
feature panel discussions on reducing the cost of building affordable
housing, presentations of case studies of lending strategies by small
and large banks, a luncheon and, in the afternoon, a bus tour of housing
developments that are sponsored by Asian Americans for Equality, many of
them in downtown Manhattan.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The conference is free and open to the public, but reservations must
be made by calling Kenneth Kidd at the N.Y.U. real estate center: (212)
998-6666.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fever has broken.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan's over-the-top real estate market, on a fast roll for more than four years, has lost its frenzied upward momentum and seems to be cooling down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apartment hunters, who this spring seemed caught up in a ''grab it now before it's gone'' panic, no longer have that desperate urge to buy, a desperation that resulted in bidding wars and angry recriminations. Within the last two months, following a rise in interest rates and a plunge in the Nasdaq, bidding wars have declined, apartments have stayed on the market longer before being sold, and hundreds have even been marked down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan real estate prices appear to be finally leveling off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One of the things everyone is beginning to feel is that the market is flat,'' said Deborah B. Beck, executive vice president of the Real Estate Board of New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another sign of a cooling off, the Real Estate Board measured a 14 percent drop in the number of Manhattan apartments sold for the quarter ended June 30, compared with the same period last year -- ''a significant slowdown,'' Ms. Beck said. At <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, sealed bids, an indicator of unusual levels of competition, were down 33 percent in July compared with July 1999.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clearly, the experts say, this is not a case of the seasonal summer blahs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market's softening is most evident with cookie-cutter, ordinary apartments -- notably fixer-uppers -- that had been selling for ''extraordinary prices'' over the last two years, said Pamela Liebman, chief executive at <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers cite myriad examples, including a five-room co-op at 240 East 76th Street reduced in June to $535,000 from $615,000. A one-bedroom at 225 Central Park West near 83rd Street dropped to $305,000 from $335,000 and a studio at 82 Irving Place fell to $175,000 from $190,000. Last Thursday, a two-bedroom at 599 West End Avenue at 89th Street dropped to $349,000 from $369,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even white-glove Gold Coast prewars may become a harder sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A five-room penthouse at 834 Fifth Avenue, at 64th Street, one of the city's top-tier co-op buildings, went on the market in April priced at $7.9 million. In late June, it was reduced to $6.49 million, and on July 31, the price dropped to $5.8 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The edge is off the market,'' said Jonathan Miller, president of Miller Samuel, the appraisal firm that compiles statistics for Douglas Elliman, the city's biggest brokerage firm. Especially during the last month, Mr. Miller said, ''we're seeing much more modest appreciation, more of a return to normalcy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The experts link the slowdown to the Nasdaq plunge that began on April 14, and to the Federal Reserve's half-point interest rate increase in May, ''the one that really had the impact,'' said Marilyn Harra Kaye, president of Prudential/ MLBKaye Realty. ''Buyers wonder if they'll get a better deal if they wait,'' she said. ''If they buy now, they worry that the higher cost of mortgages will drive prices down and lower their investment.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The changing statistics mirror a national trend, but there is nothing to indicate the start of a slump like the one in the late 1980's and early 90's. Real estate experts noted that prices remain high -- the average apartment price for the period April through June was a record $854,704 in Manhattan south of 116th Street on the West Side and south of 96th Street on the East. But that figure represents contracts signed an average of two months before -- in the white-hot months of February, March and April. Based on contracts signed in July, Mr. Miller projected a price rise of only 1 percent, to $864,000. (The average price recorded in 1995 was $414,187.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While none of the experts were willing to predict where the Manhattan market would be by the end of the year, no one labeled the cooling temporary. One thing seems certain: One of the biggest sellers' markets in New York history has fractionally tilted more toward the buyer -- and the buyers are noticing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the first time in his two years of looking, Tom Pappas, a Midtown lawyer, has spotted the same properties showing up week after week on his Internet searches. But he is not biting until their prices go down. Then, he vowed, ''I'll be there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buck Morillas, who sold his house in East Hampton, N.Y., and is prowling for a great $800,000 loft in the Flatiron district, says he thinks he is getting close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Six months ago, the agents were saying, 'This place is going to fly tonight, so you better make an offer,' '' he said. ''Now the agents are whispering, 'This place is very negotiable.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For their part, brokers insist that no one is grasping at lowball offers, but they concede that now, more sellers are accepting modest reductions off the asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In interviews, agents said that today's buyers were more cautious and that they spent more time looking, but that many did, in the end, buy -- and at a good price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They reject comparisons to the late 1980's, after the October 1987 stock market debacle, when the real estate market dipped -- albeit very slowly -- into the real estate recession of the early 1990's. For one thing, they say, that was the time of a glut of new, sometimes poorly built condominiums; this time, developers built stronger, more lavishly detailed family apartments and lofts, which are still bringing record prices. And those types of luxury apartments, brokers add, are still in short supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, Ms. Kaye of Prudential/MLBKaye Realty, in a report to be released this week, found 373 price decreases in June (out of 542 changes in price), compared with 189 in February (out of 504 changes), in a market of 15,000 listings, a shift in balance she called significant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers explain that many of these price decreases -- especially those in the multimillion-dollar category -- were the result of overpricing. The Fifth Avenue penthouse ''ended up being overpriced,'' said Hall Willkie, head of residential sales at Brown Harris Stevens, the Upper East Side firm with the listing. ''We were testing the market,'' he said. ''We were aggressive, and we had to reduce the price.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the problem for brokers is that sellers do not realize that the market is in transition, said Ed Ferris, a broker with William B. May Real Estate. Many sellers expect more money than their neighbors got only a few months ago. But brokers say that kind of escalation is no longer happening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The days when everything was being priced six weeks ahead are over,'' said Frederick W. Peters, president of Ashforth Warburg Real Estate in Manhattan, referring to the strategy of setting a price based on where a property might sell in the future. ''That strategy is not working anymore. The market ain't catching up. Properties priced like that are being reduced.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the report Mr. Miller just finished for Douglas Elliman, he found that properties spent an average of 28 percent more time on the market than they did during the same period a year ago, 118 days versus 92 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These changes reflect a national trend. Fred Flick, the vice president for research at the National Association of Realtors, said the real estate market nationally was down 6 percent in volume; the association estimates that volume will be down 9 percent by the end of the year. And while it still predicts average price increases at 2 percent to 3 percent this year, that is less than last year's 4 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've slowed from a blistering pace to a simmering pace,'' Mr. Flick said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national slowdown was confirmed on Thursday, when the Commerce Department reported that across the country, new-home sales fell 3.7 percent in June to the lowest level in two and a half years. Median prices fell slightly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Clearly, home sales -- both new and existing -- have passed their peak,'' said Lyle Gramley, a consulting economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the slowdown started hitting the hottest of the country's markets -- cities like San Francisco, Houston and Atlanta -- in late April (the Nasdaq plunge) and in May (the Fed's half-point jump), the market in the Hamptons, out on the sunny, wind-swept tip of Long Island, seemed immune to the trauma.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But not anymore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Right now there's a certain hesitancy,'' said Frank Newbold, manager of Sotheby International Realty's office in East Hampton. As in Manhattan, the truly premier properties in the Hamptons are still selling close to asking price or above, he said. ''The second-tier properties sit on the shelf a bit,'' he added. Now, there are ''fewer deals, for bigger prices.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Last summer, we were rocking along at full pitch, with no looking back,'' Mr. Newbold said. As recently as the beginning of July, ''it was top down on the convertible and everybody wanted a piece of the rock out here.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now, the urgency is gone. ''Now there's a bit of caution,'' he said, ''like they don't want to be the last fool: the last person to pay the highest price.''</p>

Huntington's Housing Plan: Too Little or Too Much?

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
HOUSES that moderate-income families can afford have become elusive
in the Town of Huntington, where the median price in the resale market
is $338,000 and the price of new houses is often half a million dollars
or more.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Concerned about the lack of modestly priced housing, town officials
have prepared legislation that would require that developers who are
granted a zoning change set aside some units for moderate-income buyers.
The Town Board is expected to vote on the proposal on Aug. 29.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Town officials say that the prices on these units should not exceed
$125,000. This amount, they say, is the maximum that families with
annual incomes of $60,000 or less can afford. The $60,000 figure is 80
percent of Long Island's median, a measure often used to define
''moderate income.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
All new subdivisions of 10 or more lots requiring a zoning change
would be affected. Developers who are granted a higher density would
have to set aside 20 percent of the additional units for moderate-income
residents. A public hearing on the measure, which Frank P. Petrone, the
town supervisor, and Steve A. Israel, a town councilman, are sponsoring,
was held July 11.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''This is the start of a very, very aggressive housing program,
probably the most aggressive of any of the towns on Long Island,'' said
Mr. Petrone, a Republican.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
While praising some aspects of the proposed law, housing advocates
are sharply critical that it would not be retroactive, which means that
it could not apply to one of the largest vacant tracts remaining in the
town, on which a rezoning application is already pending.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The 380-acre parcel was formerly occupied by the Long Island
Developmental Center, a state-owned children's psychiatric hospital. The
site, part in Melville and part in Dix Hills, borders the Northern State
Parkway and Carman Road just north of the Long Island Expressway. The
current owner, SBJ Associates, bought it from New York State in October
for $16.1 million. The state retains one children's hospital building
and 34 group homes on 78 acres.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The zoning now in effect for the former hospital site would allow
only one house on a two-acre plot, or fewer than 190 houses on the 380
acres. SBJ is proposing to build up to 1,375 housing units. Of these,
1,225 would be for sale: single-level condominiums, town houses, and
semidetached and detached houses around a private 18-hole golf course.
The remainder would be rentals.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Only 75 of the larger detached houses on  half-acre and one-acre lots
would be offered for sale to all age groups, and they are expected to
sell for $500,000 and up. The remainder, including the rentals, would be
restricted to families in which at least one member is 55 or older.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
That provision has stirred the most controversy. Critics contend that
property that once was publicly owned should now include housing for
young families and for residents with moderate incomes.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
SBJ is taking the position that it is meeting another important need:
housing for older residents. ''This property cannot solve all the town's
housing needs,'' said John A. Harras, a partner in Morton Weber &amp;
Associates, the Melville law firm representing SBJ. ''We are providing a
project that meets a housing crisis for seniors, who are the
fastest-growing population in the town.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In its rezoning application, SBJ, which is a partnership formed by
two development companies, Benjamin Development of Garden City and Jobco
of Great Neck, has offered to sell 100 of its proposed 400 condominium
apartments for $145,000, which represents a $30,000 discount. State and
county subsidies could further reduce the price to $125,000, Mr. Harras
said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Under an earlier proposal, SBJ wanted to build 150 assisted-living
apartments. It is now offering to build 100 rental apartments under a
federal program that subsidizes the rents of low-income elderly tenants.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
SBJ has also said it would donate $2.5 million to a housing trust
fund that the town could use for such purposes as subsidizing  mortgages
or providing grants for down payments for needy families. ''There is no
way that anyone can criticize this project for not having an affordable
component,'' Mr. Harras said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
O NE of the two partners in SBJ, Benjamin Development, also owns an
eight-acre tract on Ruland Road in Melville, where it is proposing to
build 120 one-bedroom and studio garden apartments open to all age
groups and selling for no more than $125,000 each. That would help
provide badly needed starter homes for young couples working in the
Melville area,  Mr. Harras said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But critics say regardless of all these proposals, moderately priced
housing for young families should still be part of the mix at the former
hospital property.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Jim Morgo, the president of the Long Island Housing Partnership, a
nonprofit group based in Hauppauge, called the SBJ plan a ''missed
opportunity.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''It perpetuates the idea that seniors only want to live with seniors
and be segregated, and it misses the chance to do a visionary community
with various housing types,'' said Mr. Morgo, who served as a consultant
on the proposed legislation.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Rev. John A. Jurik, the pastor of St. Peter's Evangelical
Lutheran Church in Huntington Station and a member of a coalition known
by the acronym Lican, which stands for Long Island Congregations,
Associations and Neighborhoods, said: ''There is a crying need both for
affordable housing for seniors and for affordable housing for families
with children. Surely, out of 1,375 homes, 150 could be set aside for
families.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The idea of developing the former hospital site largely for
age-restricted housing was first proposed in 1996 by a task force formed
to come up with a plan for the site when state officials first announced
they would sell it. The 12 task force members represented the state and
county governments and local residents.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The concern was that building housing for all age groups would bring
an influx of children into the Half Hollow Hills school district, said
Mr. Petrone, the town supervisor. He said that about 1,500 new homes
have been built in the district in the last few years, and if the number
of children continued to grow, new schools would have to be built.
School taxes could rise by as much as  30 percent, he said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''We understand that there is a need for affordable housing for
families, but you also have the practical problem of crowded schools,''
he said. ''So balancing all that, we came out with a senior housing
program, for which we have now negotiated 100 affordable condominium
units and 100 affordable rental units.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The remaining housing on the former hospital property would be 350
three-bedroom town houses expected to sell for $250,000 to $270,000 and
400 semiattached and detached three-bedroom houses on the golf course
selling for around $350,000.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Long Island Association, a nonprofit business group with offices
in Commack, is also opposed to the SBJ plan, because it views high
housing costs as a threat to the region's ability to keep or draw
workers. ''The issue of affordable housing on Long Island is more
important than the effect on any individual school district,'' said
Mitchell Pally, the group's vice president for legislative and economic
affairs.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Although the town officials appear to be  standing firm on the SBJ
proposal restricting housing at the former hospital site mostly to older
residents, critics of the plan have won concessions on the pending
legislation.  It now specifies that developers cannot impose age
restrictions on any of the units they are required to offer at reduced
prices, and  units must have at least two bedrooms.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But critics are pushing for another  change. As now written, the
proposal would permit developers to reduce the 20 percent requirement to
10 percent by contributing to  the housing trust fund instead. The
amount to be paid into the trust fund would depend on the density the
developer is granted under a rezoning. A fee of $75,000 per house would
apply where lots are 15,000 square feet or less; $150,000 per house for
lots of 20,000 square feet and $200,000 per house for lots of one acre.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Opponents of that provision say that with so little land still
available for development within the town, building housing is more
important than building a trust fund. ''Once the land is gone, the
opportunity to build more affordable housing is also gone,'' said Mr.
Jurik, the Lutheran pastor.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But Mr. Israel, the leader of the Town Board's Democratic majority,
said he was unwilling to concede that point because the trust fund could
serve a broad base of needy families and first-time buyers. ''Housing
advocates feel the entire 20 percent should be used for housing built on
site, and I think that's very shortsighted,'' he said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
To guarantee that the housing will remain  moderately priced, the
proposed law would require deed restrictions to limit profits when
owners resold their houses.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Although critics of the town plan say that it falls short, they also
praise the town for proposing any program at all. ''It's a town doing
something,'' said Mr. Morgo of the Long Island Housing Partnership.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Jurik said the need now was for all groups to work together. ''If
reasonable people sit down around a table and talk about this,'' he
said, ''we won't end up as a fractured society.''

New-Home Sales Fell in June; Other Economic Signs Mixed

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON, Aug. 2 -- Sales of new homes fell in June to the lowest
level in two and a half years as a rise in borrowing costs engineered by
the Federal Reserve made it more expensive for people to buy, government
figures showed today.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Single-family home sales -- which declined in all regions except the
western United States -- fell 3.7 percent in June, to an annual rate of
829,000 units, after falling to 861,000 units in May, the Commerce
Department said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In a separate report, the Conference Board said its index of leading
economic indicators -- a gauge of economic performance over the next six
to nine months -- was unchanged in June, the third consecutive month
without an increase. The index fell 0.1 percent in May and was unchanged
in April.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In the housing sector, the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate
mortgage in June was 8.23 percent, according to the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corporation, which buys mortgages. While down from the recent
peak of 8.64 percent in mid-May, rates are still above the average 7.55
percent of June 1999. One-year adjustable rates breached 7 percent in
June and reached 7.32 percent in mid-July, the highest since 1991.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The June pace of new-home sales was the slowest since an annual rate
of 793,000 units in December 1997, the data showed.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Slow sales pushed the median price of a new home down 1.4 percent, to
$159,000 in June, from $161,200 in May. The June price was the lowest
since $154,900 last August. The supply of new homes for sale rose to 4.9
months, the highest since December 1996, when it was 5 months.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Even with three months of declines, new-home sales are on track to
finish the year at 885,000 units, close to the 886,000 sold in 1998, the
second-best year on record. The highest was last year's 907,000.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Consumer confidence in July was close to the record reached in May
and January. The unemployment rate in June was 4 percent, close to a
30-year low, and a Commerce Department report on Tuesday showed June
incomes grew 0.4 percent.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Fed policy makers have raised the overnight bank lending rate six
times since June 1999 in an effort to slow the economy and keep
inflation from rising. They will next meet on Aug. 22 and with housing
and manufacturing showing signs of slowing, policy makers could opt to
leave rates alone.

Benefits of Sit-Down Contract
</span>
</div><div>712 words</div><div>9 July 2000</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Page 6, Column 6</div><div>English</div><div>

</div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Q What are the benefits and drawbacks of having a ''sit-down''
contract of sale when purchasing real estate? . . . George M. Colt, the
Bronx.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A Peter Schwartz, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, said that in most
residential real estate transactions, the contract of sale is the
product of negotiations conducted between the lawyers for the parties
rather than the parties themselves. In most cases, Mr. Schwartz said,
after the buyer and seller agree on a price, the seller's lawyer draws
up the contract and sends it to the buyer's lawyer.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The buyer's lawyer makes whatever changes he thinks necessary, allows
the client to sign it, and then sends the amended contract back to the
seller's lawyer for signing by the seller -- if the seller agrees to the
amendments. In some cases, Mr. Schwartz said, the contract can be
amended several times before its terms have been agreed to by all.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
With a so-called sit-down contract, Mr. Schwartz said, the
negotiations are conducted in one place, at one time and with all the
parties and their lawyers present.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Sit-downs usually happen when there are anxious parties on both
sides who don't want to wait for their attorneys to draft the
contract,'' he said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The most obvious benefit of a sit-down negotiation, Mr. Schwartz
said, is that the parties end up with a binding contract in the least
amount of time.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''That's especially good for purchasers these days because in a
seller's market, it makes sense for the buyer to lock the seller into
the deal as quickly as possible,'' he said. At the same time, Mr.
Schwartz said, the primary disadvantage of a sit-down contract is that
it costs more.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Usually, both lawyers will charge more because instead of doing the
negotiations in the comfort of their office, one or both will have to go
out to a meeting and then sit there while the parties try to hammer out
a deal,'' he said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Schwartz said that while a sit-down contract may be useful for
the purchase of a house -- because most such contracts contain clauses
allowing the buyer to cancel the deal if defects are revealed by a home
inspection -- the same may not be said for purchases of an apartment.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''When you're buying an apartment, you always want your lawyer to
conduct a due-diligence before you sign,'' he said, referring to the
examination of books and records that lawyers conduct to ensure that a
co-op corporation or condominium association is financially sound.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Dealing With A Judgment Lien
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Q At a real estate closing, what is the normal way for the parties to
deal with a judgment lien on the property? . . . Donna Raft, Manhattan.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A ''The normal way to deal with a judgment lien at a closing is to
pay it,'' said John G. Hall, a Staten Island real estate lawyer.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Hall explained that a judgment lien is a legal filing that gives
a creditor an interest in real estate owned by a debtor. And while such
a lien is not filed against a specific piece of property, he said, the
filing of such a lien typically makes it impossible for the debtor to
sell a property in the county where the lien was filed until the lien is
paid.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Accordingly, Mr. Hall said, if the title search reveals an
outstanding lien against the seller, the seller's lawyer will contact
the person who filed the lien to determine the amount necessary to pay
it -- an amount that often includes interest that has accrued since the
judgment was obtained.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
If the figure is determined before the closing, he said, the lawyer
for the buyer will satisfy it out of the proceeds of the sale that are
due to the seller.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
If the payoff amount of the lien is not known on the day of closing,
Mr. Hall said, the title company for the buyer will generally require
the buyer's lawyer to hold twice the amount of the original lien in
escrow until the exact payoff amount is determined and the lien is paid
in full and removed from official records.

running the faucets, counting the closets and opening and closing the
windows and doors. And after that, in most cases, they go out and hire a
professional house inspector to pick up where they left off.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
What happens, though, when a buyer is buying a potential house -- one
that hasn't even been built yet -- or recently completed new
construction?
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
'' 'New construction' doesn't mean 'without flaws,' '' said Kenneth
T. Austin, president of HouseMaster, a nationwide home-inspection
company based in Bound Brook, N.J. ''Many times there are flaws in the
construction of new homes, some of which can be serious and expensive.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Among the problems Mr. Austin's inspectors have found in new homes
are: damaged or improperly installed fixtures; water penetration caused
by improper grading of the soil where it meets the foundation;
foundation cracking caused by improper backfilling of soil around the
house; improper deck supports; improperly wired electrical receptacles;
disconnected heating and air-conditioning ducts; unlabeled electrical
panels; and even nonfunctioning light switches and electrical outlets.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Most new-home buyers don't see the need for a home inspection,''
Mr. Austin said, adding that while construction codes are designed to
ensure that new construction is completed in accordance with a set of
minimum standards, the code-enforcement inspectors can't catch
everything and aren't even looking for problems of an aesthetic nature.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
For example, Mr. Austin said, if the grading of the soil against the
foundation slopes away from the house -- as it should, to prevent water
from pooling along the foundation wall -- the building inspector will
typically be satisfied. However, he said, if the soil has not been
tamped down properly, there is a possibility that after a period of time
the soil will settle, thereby creating a slope toward the house and the
possibility of future seepage.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Another thing that would probably not be noted by a building
inspector would be sloppily mitered joints on woodwork around doors and
windows, an aesthetic eyesore rather than a structural problem.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Buying a new house gives people a false sense of security,'' Mr.
Austin said. ''They end up looking at the whole process through
rose-colored glasses.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Paul Gallo, a Manhattan registered architect, agreed.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''When you're thinking about buying a newly constructed house you
shouldn't be bashful,'' Mr. Gallo said. ''You have to get inside and
slam some doors, make some noise and jump up and down on the floors. You
have to get physical.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
He said that one of the biggest problems that new houses have --
despite the fact that they may meet the minimum requirements of the
building codes -- is that the floors and walls are not necessarily as
solid and soundproof as those in older construction.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''The first thing to do when you walk into a new house is test its
bounce factor,'' Mr. Gallo said, explaining that he encourages clients
to jump up and down in the middle of the room to get a feel for how much
the floor gives under such punishment. ''If you have kids with you, send
them upstairs and have someone go up and play with them,'' he said.
''That will give you some idea of the soundproofing and some idea of
what it's going to be like living in the house.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Another thing that prospective purchasers of new construction can do
is to turn on the heating and air-conditioning system to determine
whether it has any annoying quirks.  ''If the ductwork thumps every time
the air-conditioning comes on, that's going to drive you crazy after a
few weeks,'' he said, adding that it is also wise to run the dishwasher
and washing machine to determine whether the water pipes bang when the
machines cycle on and off.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''These things may not be deal-breakers, but you're really doing
yourself a favor by having a checklist of things that should be
corrected before you agree to buy the house,'' he said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Robert Tierman, a real estate lawyer in Hackensack, N.J., said that
people buying a new house can exercise the greatest degree of control if
they buy early enough in the process to dictate the material and
construction methods that will be used.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Builders like to maximize their flexibility,'' Mr. Tierman said,
explaining that if a builder's contract specifies only ''a
fully-equipped bathroom,'' that allows the builder to decide what type
and grade fixtures to install. ''If you'll be satisfied with the
fixtures the builder installs you'll have no problem,'' he said. ''But
if you want Kohler plumbing fixtures, you better make sure you specify
Kohler fixtures in the contract.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In fact, buyers who are negotiating a construction contract might
want to include a provision that will allow home-inspection firms like
HouseMaster to make periodic inspections during construction.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''We recommend a three-stage inspection,'' said Mr. Austin, the
company's president. The first inspection, he said, would be conducted
after the foundation and rough framing is complete. The second would be
after all heating, cooling, electrical equipment and plumbing have been
installed. And the third would be after construction has been completed.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''We're there to look for errors in workmanship,'' he said, adding
that a staged inspection -- which costs about $250 for each of the three
inspections -- is not intended to second-guess the architect, the
builder or the building inspector, but to ensure that the buyer is
getting the quality of workmanship being paid  for.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But won't a builder bristle at having someone else inspect his
handiwork?
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Absolutely,'' Mr. Austin said.  ''But you have to hang tough.
People have to realize that the greatest power they have is the power to
walk away from the deal.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
John G. Hall, a Staten Island real estate lawyer and former chairman
of the New York State Bar Association's Real Property Section, said that
in many new-home sales the buyer bases the decision on a model home
constructed by the builder.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''If the house you are buying is based on a model, as opposed to a
set of plans and specifications, you want to make sure that you will be
getting what you think you'll be getting,'' Mr. Hall said. For example,
he said, a builder who installs high-quality fixtures in the model could
install less-expensive fixtures in the houses built for sale -- if the
contract permits.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Even room sizes in models can be deceiving. ''I can tell you that I
have seen some builders use scaled-down furniture in their models so
that the rooms would look larger,'' Mr. Hall said, explaining that while
such practices are not engaged in by reputable builders, buyers should
leave nothing to chance.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''Builders' contracts are usually very onerous,'' Mr. Hall said. ''If
I were buying a new house today, and I wasn't a lawyer myself, the first
thing I'd do would be to hire one.''

Martha's Vineyard Adds to New-Home Curbs

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
AQUINNAH, MARTHA'S VINEYARD, Mass. -- TO avoid being swamped in its
own popularity and rising real estate prices, this historic resort
island has tightened its already demanding rules on residential
development. As of this spring, fewer building permits are being issued
and almost no historic structures razed in an effort to manage growth so
that new houses enhance, rather than overwhelm, the architectural and
natural environment
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
This island, settled in 1642, is filled with historic buildings set
in beguiling natural settings. Still, 18th-century villages dot a
landscape encircled by ocean and threaded with ponds, woods and fields.
Federalist mansions line narrow Edgartown streets, Victorian cottages
cluster around lagoons in Oak Bluffs and Georgian manor houses still
grace erstwhile West Tisbury and Chilmark farms while early 20th-century
fishing shacks overlook Aquinnah's shores.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But increasingly, wealthy buyers are racing to scoop up the limited
supply of home sites. In their rush, some tear down old houses and block
shoreline vistas to erect big luxury homes known derisively as
McMansions. Soaring land and house costs, meanwhile, are pricing local
working people out of the market.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In response, this spring five of the island's six towns voted to
adopt limitations on construction of new buildings. Only Tisbury voted
the limits down.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
This year, only 243 building permits will be issued for new houses in
all five towns (the average number issued since 1983).  Islandwide,
including all six towns, 339 permits were issued in 1998, the last year
for which statistics are available, according to Charles W. Clifford,
director of the Martha's Vineyard Commission, the island planning
agency. Aquinnah will issue 6, Chilmark 18, West Tisbury 54, Edgartown
93 and Oak Bluffs about 72, Mr. Clifford said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''These first islandwide caps will be reviewed in three years,'' he
added. ''We're aiming to moderate development, give towns time to assess
today's fast growth and pass better rules to handle it.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
To promote the preservation of historic structures, open space and
the production of lower-cost housing, most towns offer height and
density bonuses for projects that further those goals. In Aquinnah and
neighboring Chilmark, meanwhile, plans for any new house must undergo
extensive review by a special town commission, while no building may be
torn down without first obtaining a demolition permit.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Owners can still build if they submit to a one-  or two-year approval
process and plan a modest house, said Jerry Weiner, the Aquinnah
building inspector. ''Anyone who wants to make this fragile outpost
theirs must be willing to slow down to examine the issues we face,'' he
said. ''Recently, too many have built big houses that scar the land and
burden the infrastructure without realizing it.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But with many islanders working in the real estate industry, not all
favor the caps on construction. ''When supply is low, caps drive up
prices,'' said Arthur Smadbeck, an owner of Priestly &amp; Smadbeck Real
Estate of Tisbury. ''This exacerbates our affordable housing shortage.
We just closed a unit in the nursing home for lack of workers.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The nearby island of Nantucket, where the median house price is
$900,000, faces similar dilemmas, said Jack H. Dunn, the island's
building inspector. Each day, 400 workers are brought in from Hyannis on
Cape Cod. ''It's a serious problem when we have to fly our bus drivers
and cashiers in on a shuttle flight every day,'' Mr. Dunn said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
INDEED, the churning real-estate market has ''caused an onslaught of
teardowns and gut rehabs that imperil the historic island's character,''
according to the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Last month,
it placed Nantucket on a list of America's 11 most endangered historic
places, despite islanders' attempts to save its architectural heritage.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Since the 1950's, Nantucket's Historic District Commission has
approved the exterior appearance of all new structures. A 1997 building
cap has limited new house construction; this year, 110 building permits
will be issued. This fall, Mr. Dunn said, voters will consider a new
growth management plan that will further restrict new construction based
on a point system that favors affordable housing.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
On Cape Cod this April, Provincetown tied new building permits to the
water supply, a limit of about 12 a year, half the previous amount. In
1998, Falmouth also halved the number of permits; this year it will
approve 200 building permits, said Brian Curry, the town planner. These
historic resorts are under similar market pressures. On Martha's
Vineyard last year there were 1,070 sales of land and houses, up from
494 in 1990, according to the Martha's Vineyard Land Bank Commission.
The median single-family sale price is $700,000, with the high end up to
$11 million and the low end disappearing, Mr. Smadbeck said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
With land often priced at $1 million an acre and new construction at
least $300 a square foot, even a modest new 3,000-square-foot house can
cost close to $2 million, brokers and architects say.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Each town has a somewhat different set of construction rules, but
they all aim to encourage the construction of ''island friendly''
houses.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In Oak Bluffs, the new cap was added to 12-year-old historic
preservation rules that require Victorian styling and new houses of only
three bedrooms in some neighborhoods. To fit in, Dr. and Mrs. Arthur
Spielvogel of Ridgewood, N.J., had Peter Breese Architects design a
3,000-square-foot house on a lagoon with cedar shingles and an
old-fashioned screened-in porch. While the house has a traditional
Victorian exterior, an open interior layout gives it a spacious feel.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
West Tisbury's new zoning code, adopted  this spring, expanded the
historic district to embrace 120 properties, up from 12; adopted a
building cap: and now requires a permit for all demolition, a
requirement that recently stopped one buyer from tearing down a 1600's
tavern. The new code also suspends a three-acre zoning requirement to
preserve farmland and promote lower-priced housing.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
West Tisbury wants more projects like Island Co-Housing, which is
just being completed in the woods off North Road. On four  acres of a
30-acre site, John Abrams, who owns the South Mountain Company,
developed 16 single-family houses priced from $125,000 to $310,000.
Privately, the 16 families raised funds to subsidize the lower-priced
units.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''I'm in heaven,'' said Christie Phillips, 38. A year-round resident
who designs interiors and clothing, she moved in with her two sons this
spring after a seven-year housing search. ''I have a gem of a house and
a real neighborhood here with a pond, playground and community house.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In rural Chilmark, development bonuses also go to low-cost housing
and salvaging historic structures. Starting in 1990, Ben Clark, a
historic preservationist, and his wife, Suzanne, disassembled, board by
board, the manor that Simon Athearn had built in 1730 on his farm in
West Tisbury. The Clarks were allowed to add a 300-square-foot addition
for a new kitchen to the reconstructed house.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
And to be historically accurate, the house, reconstruction of which
was completed last year, is 28 feet high -- a 4-foot height bonus over
what would be allowed by current regulations.
</p>
