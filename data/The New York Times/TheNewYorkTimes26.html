<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PARKER, Colo., July 12 -- Tom Woods, a 37-year-old defense industry consultant, wanted to build a nest egg for one of his young sons' college tuition. Inspired by rising prices for homes in this Denver suburb, three years ago he invested in a new three-bedroom townhouse for $155,000. His hopes were that renters would cover most of his mortgage and that the property's value would appreciate by at least $10,000 a year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But last October, when Mr. Woods put the townhouse up for sale to help pay some unforeseen medical bills, there was more pain than gain: the house sat on the market for eight months. He finally found a buyer in June, but to seal the deal he had to make big concessions, including paying the buyer's closing costs. After handing over the keys on Friday, he ended up with a profit of just $10,000 for his three-year investment.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as prices for homes in frothy markets like Las Vegas; Riverside, Calif.; Miami; and Washington are still jumping by more than 20 percent a year, Denver's homeowners are learning the hard way about living through the real estate doldrums. Five years ago, median house prices were rising at an annual clip of nearly 17 percent. By the first quarter of 2005 the increase had slipped to 3 percent, according to an analysis by Economy.com, a research firm.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some Denver homeowners have read reports in the news media of skyrocketing prices elsewhere and assume they are accumulating wealth in their homes at the same rapid pace.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was surprised,'' Mr. Woods said. ''My expectations were higher.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although sellers continue to profit, houses are sitting on the market longer, buyers are negotiating harder, and some owners, particularly young buyers who may have been counting on rapid appreciation, are postponing dreams of renovations, moves to larger homes and big savings for their families.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With economists warning that prices in hot markets cannot continue to rise as sharply as they have in the past few years, the experience of Denver's homeowners may foreshadow what could happen if those markets start to cool. Denver's circumstances are in some ways particular to the area, driven largely by job losses in the telecom sector, but they illustrate how a moderate slowdown could play out for homeowners in other parts of the country and stand as a potent reminder that galloping price appreciation is not the norm.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists are divided as to whether certain markets will simply cool off, or whether they will actually melt and send prices plummeting, as happened in parts of California, New England and New York in the 1980's and early 1990's. Earlier this year, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said some metro areas were showing signs of ''froth.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Optimists point to Denver as a model of an adjusting real estate market. ''I think it's a good example of when a market softens, what happens,'' said David Lereah, the chief economist of the National Association of Realtors, a trade association. ''You see double-digit price appreciation go down to 4 percent or even 1 percent, and then it starts coming back to a historical norm of between 4 and 6 percent. That's very healthy. That's wonderful. It beats inflation.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many analysts take a gloomier perspective, suggesting that the most heated markets could suffer more than Denver's so-called soft landing. ''I think Denver is a best-case scenario,'' said John H. Vogel Jr., adjunct professor of real estate at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College. In the case of markets like Naples, Fla.; Miami; and New York, he said, ''I think you'll see dramatic price decreases because I think the prices have become artificially inflated by trading and speculation.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Denver's housing boom never quite reached the heights of Las Vegas's, for example, where home prices increased by nearly 33 percent in the first quarter of this year, according to Economy.com. But from 1998 through the third quarter of 2001, homeowners in sprawling Denver enjoyed double-digit appreciation as telecom employers like Qwest Communications International added jobs -- and homebuyers -- to the market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From December 2000 to September 2003, however, Denver lost about 74,000 jobs, about 6 percent of its job base, according to Economy.com. Increases in home prices stalled, then started to taper off. Houses lingered on the market, and sellers were forced to cut prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Touring a development last week in Castle Rock, a southeastern suburb, Tom Santilli, an agent with Re/Max Alliance, pointed out a four-bedroom house that had not sold for five months, despite its impeccable condition. The price had been lowered to $396,500 from $419,000, but because of a few flaws -- a smallish family room, and white kitchen cabinets instead of wood and glass -- the sellers had ''not even had a low-ball offer'' after showing it to 65 prospective buyers, Mr. Santilli said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where buyers here had few properties to choose from in the late 1990's, today they can afford to be picky. Inventories of available homes have tripled from 8,010 in January 2000 to 25,817 in June, according to Gary Bauer, a real estate broker and consultant in Denver.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sellers are also competing with homebuilders, who are offering incentives like discounted mortgage rates and free air-conditioning.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Sapphire Pointe, a subdivision in Castle Rock, huge beige and cream houses, dubbed prairie palaces by local residents, are clustered along curving lanes and cul-de-sacs. Last week the builder, D.R. Horton Continental Series, was offering a four-bedroom, 4,371-square-foot house for $489,697, $40,000 below the listed price. The builder had added upgrades that included fireplaces; granite countertops; and metal banister pickets on the curving staircase. The master bathroom was bigger than some studio apartments in Manhattan.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many sellers of existing homes are offering incentives of their own. When Mary Ann and Brian Kuklinski put their mocha-colored three-bedroom house on the market in May for $275,000, they knew that a house nearby had languished on the market for eight months. After five weeks and 30 showings, they reached a deal by lowering their price to $270,000 and throwing in their washer and dryer, the refrigerator, and a swing set in the backyard.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kuklinskis, who have three sons, ages 11, 7 and 5, paid $197,000 for their home in 1999 and ended up with enough appreciation to help with a down payment on a house they are building nearby, a $385,000 four-bedroom with a three-car garage.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for other homeowners, the calculus of the 1990's that might have led them to trade up quickly no longer applies. ''When the market was strong, somebody would move up to a nicer home in two years because they had so much equity,'' said Karen Snyder, an owner of Metro Brokers Right Realty in Centennial, a suburb southeast of Denver. Now, she said, ''they're just staying put.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who had hoped to tap increased equity to pay for home improvements are also scrapping their plans. Gustavo Salazar, a high school math teacher, bought a small house with his fiancee, her sister and her boyfriend two years ago for $232,000. Earlier this year they decided to refinish the basement. But when they checked with their mortgage lender, they learned that they only had about $9,000 of equity in the house, less than the estimated $15,000 they would need for the project.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Salazar, 30, said he was shocked that the house had appreciated so little. ''I was thinking the market was going up because this is such a nice area,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michelle Konishi and her husband, Jeff Konishi, were living in a four-bedroom, four-bathroom house not far from Mr. Salazar when they filed for divorce. They paid about $350,000 in 1999 to build their house, and put it on the market at $474,900 in April 2003. Five price cuts and 10 months later, they sold it for $405,500. Because they had invested in landscaping, a deck, carpeting and custom window coverings, Ms. Konishi said, the couple just about broke even.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local analysts say it was inevitable that surging prices would not last. ''Now we're back to what I would portray as a normal market,'' said Mr. Bauer, the real estate consultant. ''Historically we had 5 percent appreciation, and now we have 5 percent appreciation.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While many homeowners have adjusted to the new reality, others pine for the good times that still exist in other markets.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When sellers come in with high expectations, Chad Ochsner, a managing broker with Re/Max Alliance, said he reminds them that ''just because it's like that in Las Vegas or Phoenix, that doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be the same way here in Denver.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If some of those places follow Denver's lead, it may be for reasons other than those that softened Denver's conditions, economists say. ''The thing that weighed on Denver's housing market was its job market,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Economy.com. He added, ''The concern now is that interest rates rise and suck the wind out of housing demand.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, analysts say the Denver market has remained as healthy as it has because of low mortgage rates as well as creative financing, including no-money-down and interest-only loans. Interest-only loans have accounted for a high rate -- 42 percent -- of purchase loans over $360,000 in Denver this year, according to LoanPerformance, a mortgage data firm.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That unnerves some economists, who say that even with appreciation of less than 5 percent, Denver's housing prices may be overvalued.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think it is a very frothy market,'' said Tucker Hart Adams, the chief economist of the Rocky Mountain region for U.S. Bank, adding that those who bought homes with interest-only or variable-rate mortgages could be vulnerable. ''When rates start moving up, they're going to see their payments go up,'' she said. ''When people start getting nervous and start to sell, it's a downward spiral.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the warnings, some of those like Mr. Woods, who have seen less than stellar returns, say they have not soured on real estate. Mr. Woods said he still hopes to invest in real estate and pay for his three children's college educations. ''If I had the cash available to invest in a rental property, I would do it,'' he said. ''It's a pain, but I still think, over time, that there are some real good benefits to it.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FREDERICK, Md. -- Danilo Molina has never flipped a house to make a quick profit from rising real estate values. He has not refinanced a mortgage. He does not even own a home.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, the decade-long housing boom has been very good to Mr. Molina, a slight 21-year-old with a shy smile. He has been working on construction crews since he arrived in this country from El Salvador six years ago, and today he supplies workers, including himself, to build new houses in this fast-growing county roughly 50 miles northwest of Washington.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I saw my friends -- they make money,'' he said on a sun-baked recent afternoon in front of a half-finished house, describing his career choice. ''Now I've got a small company.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Molina is one small part of what might be called the real estate industrial complex, the economic engine that has become one of the few reliable sources of growth in recent years. Encompassing everything from land surveyors to general contractors to loan officers, the sprawling sector has added 700,000 jobs to the nation's payrolls over the last four years, according to an analysis by Economy.com, a research firm.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Combined, the rest of the economy has lost nearly 400,000 jobs over the same span, which stretches back to the start of the most recent recession, in 2001.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all its benefits, the newfound power of real estate has also left the country vulnerable to a housing slowdown, which many economists expect over the next few years. Residential housing now makes up 16 percent, or $1.9 trillion, of the gross domestic product and is the economy's largest single sector, slightly bigger than the industries and services that supply health care, according to Economy.com.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frederick, an old farming area not far from the Antietam, Gettysburg and Harpers Ferry battlefields, is a typical housing-dependent community, where new homes are sprouting from the ground even as the values of existing ones are still soaring. Much of the interior West and less crowded parts of California and Florida have also been adding real estate jobs by the thousands.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In suburban office buildings, like the ones run by Citigroup and Wells Fargo here in Frederick, mortgage companies have hired back-office workers to handle the crush of loans generated by low-interest rates. Planned communities in the nation's expanding exurbs employ carpenters, plumbers and garbage haulers. Laid-off workers from other industries are trying their hand at selling real estate.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've been building since the Pilgrims landed,'' said Joe L. Beynon, 52, who became a project manager for a home builder here after the music school he was helping to found failed to get off the ground. ''I don't think you'd ever run out of a source of work in this industry.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Frederick and the surrounding parts of suburban Maryland, one of every nine jobs is in real estate. The share would be even greater, builders say, if worries about overcrowding in schools and on roads had not caused county officials to reduce the number of building permits they have granted.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Naples, Fla., a growing area in southwestern Florida that has had to rebuild in the wake of recent hurricanes, leads the country with one out of every six jobs in a housing-related business.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[The Labor Department reported Friday that the economy added 146,000 jobs in June, roughly 30,000 of them in housing.]  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economic growth of the real estate industrial complex has only added to its longstanding political clout. The housing and construction industries gave $167 million to campaigns during the 2004 election cycle, more than the agribusiness, defense, energy and computer industries put together, according to the Center for Responsive Politics in Washington.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Republicans received about 65 percent of the industries' contributions during the 2004 election cycle. In recent months, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, and George Allen, Republican from Virginia -- senators often mentioned as 2008 presidential candidates -- have been among the biggest recipients.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond money, the housing complex has the benefit of a constituency that numbers in the tens of millions: American homeowners. When President Bush appointed a commission to study tax changes, he suggested that only two provisions, the tax breaks for charitable contributions and for payments of mortgage interest, were untouchable.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike other industries that have boomed recently -- health care and technology in particular -- real estate has the advantage of relatively low barriers to entry. A college degree, let alone one from a medical or business school, is not a prerequisite for a middle-class income, as Mr. Molina has discovered.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few months ago, he was helping build a house at Worman's Mill, a 1,500-house development just north of the city of Frederick, when he noticed a carpenter putting up a gazebo on some grass in the middle of a road. Mr. Molina walked over and said he wanted to learn how to do that kind of detailed work.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, he is a subcontractor for that carpenter, Ronald Malatak, and makes probably $1,500 in a typical week after paying the other workers on the crew, Mr. Malatak said. Working 10 hours a day, Monday through Saturday, they earn $12.50 to $17 an hour.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Make no mistake about it -- it is labor,'' Mr. Malatak said, as one of the men walked across the sloped roof of a wood-frame house. ''But they make good money.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike Muren is only a year older than Mr. Molina and is benefiting even more from the boom. He began answering phones at the offices of Mackintosh Realtors, amid the painted row houses of downtown Frederick, when he was still in high school. Rather than go to college, he decided to stick around and get his license to sell real estate.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I thought, 'This doesn't look too difficult. I could probably do this,''' said Mr. Muren, tall and lanky, with a cellphone microphone clipped to the collar of his deep blue shirt. After high school, he passed his Realtor's test, traded in his Camaro for a Toyota Camry and began selling houses.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, he made about $250,000 and, to the great amusement of his colleagues, now drives a Cadillac CTS.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A Cadillac?'' Betsy Cain, another agent in the office and the mother of one of Mr. Muren's high school classmates, remembers asking him when he brought her out to the parking lot to see it. ''You're 22 years old!''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To Mr. Muren, it is all part of the job. ''I could probably go to six years of college and not make as much in five years of work as I did last year,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the real estate sector, though, incomes are lower on average -- about $38,000 -- than they are in the rest of the economy, where the typical yearly pay is about $41,000. While mortgage brokers, architects and some real estate agents do much better, call-center employees at banks and janitors tend to make relatively little.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parts of the business have also become far more productive, requiring many fewer workers than were once needed for the same amount of output. Mortgage bankers, for example, no longer have to sort through the mounds of paper they once did and their software for assessing risk is much more powerful.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The First Horizon Home Loan Corporation, which has a branch in Frederick, employs about 5,900 people today, up from 4,000 five years ago, said Jerry Baker, the chief executive. But the volume of loans the company handles has more than doubled over the same period.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The story here is twofold,'' Mark Zandi, chief economist of Economy.com, said. ''Real estate has been an important job creator in bad times, but it's also a reason we haven't created a lot of jobs'' elsewhere in the economy since the recession ended in late 2001. That is because growth in the housing industry does not put as many people to work as does growth in other industries. ''It's this bright shining light in the economy,'' he said, ''that doesn't create a lot of jobs.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, the biggest concern is that the light will dim as long-term interest rates rise or, at the very least, stop falling. Fixed mortgage rates are now barely above their lowest point in more than a generation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, if housing prices in the hottest markets actually begin falling, as some economists fear, the vast real estate sector could act as a drag on the entire economy. About 40 percent of housing booms in rich countries over the last three decades have ended in busts, according to a recent study by the International Monetary Fund. Busts almost inevitably led to recessions, the study found.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Reserve officials, like many analysts, are hoping that other industries will take up any slack created by a housing slowdown and start to expand more quickly. People in Frederick are hoping that a slowdown, if it comes, will be a lot gentler than the real estate slump that hit in the late 80's, around the time that the housing markets in New York, New England and California also started struggling.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If we were to go back to a market like we had in '89,'' said Buzz Mackintosh, an owner of Mackintosh Realtors, ''there would be a lot of cold slaps to the face.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising housing prices and new construction have fed employment booms in the broader economy in many areas of the country. In many cases, real estate jobs have grown even as employment in other sectors has fallen.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By JOSH BARBANEL  </div><div>618 words</div><div>3 July 2005</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>24</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2005 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A rush of market reports using different numbers and methodologies all concluded last week that prices in the Manhattan real estate market hit a new high during a frothy spring selling season. Average prices rose for everything from cramped studios to four-bedroom apartments, lofts and town houses.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reports confirm that despite worries about a bubble in real estate prices here and around the country, buyer interest remained strong, with frequent bidding wars, both in older apartment buildings and new condominiums just coming to market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was only a year or so ago that average cooperative and condominium prices reached the $1 million mark in Manhattan. Yesterday, the very day the quarter ended, major Manhattan brokers sent out competing claims for new highs in average sales.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prudential Douglas Elliman put the average sale price at $1.32 million, 8.5 percent above the last quarter, and 30 percent above a year earlier, when they reached $1,009,998.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brown Harris Stevens calculated it at $1.28 million, 9 percent above the figures it reported the previous quarter and 21 percent more than a year ago. A third firm, Corcoran Group, reported that the average price for a co-op reached $1.08 million, while an average condominium fetched $1.54 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers and analysts attributed the surge to continuing low interest rates, which dipped even lower during the quarter, a tight supply of apartments on the market, rising incomes and confidence in the economy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were also the lingering effects of year-end bonuses for Wall Street executives -- some of whom signed contracts in the winter, but closed on sales in the spring.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you've been waiting for prices to come down, you have been waiting a long time,'' said Gregory J. Heym, chief economist for Brown Harris Stevens. ''The fundamentals have only gotten better and they were strong to begin with.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price increases were particularly strong downtown, where new buildings were coming on the market and the average price of a three-bedroom apartment increased 46 percent to $2.4 million in the last year, according to Brown Harris Stevens.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there were also strong price increases in smaller apartments. The Prudential Douglas Elliman report found that average prices on studios increased by 12 percent in the last quarter, to $380,000 from $337,000, more than any other size apartment.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while the average price is affected by multimillion-dollar sales, another measure, the median price, also rose to record levels, showing the breadth of the increases. Half of the apartments sold for less than the median price, and half sold for more.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median prices reported by Douglas Elliman increased to $775,000, or by 9.9 percent from the price recorded three months earlier, and a 24 percent increase from the previous year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan J. Miller, an appraiser and president of Miller Samuel Inc., who prepared the Prudential Douglas Elliman report, said that 800 Manhattan cooperative and condominium sales this quarter, or 37 percent of the sales he tallied, were for more than $1 million. In the last quarter of 2001, after the World Trade Center attack, only 13 percent of sales were above $1 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were many reports of sellers with multiple offers during the peak of the spring season, with sellers walking away with multiple backup offers and brokers talking about ''frenzy'', but that cooled somewhat in the last few weeks among more expensive apartments, as more apartments, including newly completed units, came on the market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We had overpricing by sellers and that dampened enthusiasm by buyers,'' said Pamela Liebman, president and chief executive of the Corcoran Group.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By DANIEL GROSS  </div><div>1071 words</div><div>26 June 2005</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2005 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ANYBODY who has bought or sold a home recently -- or who has picked up a newspaper -- knows that housing prices are rising rapidly. The National Association of Realtors projects that the median sales price of an existing home will rise 8.8 percent this year, after climbing 8.3 percent in 2004.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the government agency that collects, mixes and distills data into the Consumer Price Index, says the increase in housing costs has been muted. The index, the broadest measure of inflation for consumer activity, shows that housing costs rose just 0.1 percent in May and 3 percent in the last 12 months. That begs a question: When housing is the biggest single expenditure for most Americans, and when half of the nation is fretting about a housing bubble and the other half is logging on to CondoFlip.com, how can inflation remain tame?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer has to do with the occasionally strange way the government produces the numbers that define our economic life -- numbers on which vast sums are wagered every day.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until 1983, the bureau measured housing inflation by looking at what it cost to buy and own homes, considering factors like house prices, mortgage interest costs and property taxes. But given the shifts in interest rates and housing prices, those measures could show big bounces from month to month. Besides, homes are a strange hybrid of a consumable good and a long-term investment. As part of a long-running evaluation, the bureau wanted to ''separate out the investment component from the consumption component'' of the housing market, said Patrick C. Jackman, an economist at the bureau.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, a home isn't just where you hang your hat or an investment in the future (or, in the case of visitors to CondoFlip.com, for two days). It's something that is consumed, the way potato chips, gasoline or a barber's skills are. So the bureau decided to track a measure that represents only the consumption of housing: rent. And rents had much to recommend themselves as a long-term inflationary yardstick -- they don't jump significantly from month to month -- and as a proxy for home prices. Over time, after all, rents correlated very closely to home prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's important to separate the decision that people make about housing as an investment and housing as a consumption of services,'' said Ted Wieseman, an economist at Morgan Stanley. Especially when you're trying to measure inflation. Consider the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index: it cost three times as much to buy it in 2000 than it did in 1992. But that climb didn't signify rampant inflation in the United States. The Bureau of Labor Statistics is trying to measure consumer price inflation, not asset price inflation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, for the past 22 years, it has measured inflation in the cost of housing in a rather indirect way. As part of its Consumer Expenditure Survey, the bureau collects information from thousands of Americans about how much they pay for rent. But because renters are only a small part of the population, it also tries to measure how much homeowners are essentially paying themselves in rent. To determine the so-called owners' equivalent rent, it asks homeowners how much they would have to pay to rent the house in which they live. That figure constitutes about 23.2 percent of the Consumer Price Index, by far its largest component. Food is 14.3 percent and transportation is 17.4 percent, for example.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are a few problems with using owners' equivalent rent as a measure of inflation for shelter costs. First, rent and home prices have become decoupled over the last several years, as Richard J. Rosen, an economist who is an adviser to the Chicago Federal Reserve, has observed. In the last 12 months, owners' equivalent rent has risen only by 2.3 percent, while housing prices have risen by a much larger amount.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Of course, some of this decoupling has been a response to the low mortgage rates,'' Mr. Rosen said, adding that it was an open question whether it signaled an enduring disconnection between rents and home prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second, years of falling interest rates and the vast expansion of the mortgage industry have changed the historical dynamics between renting and owning. From 1994 to 2004, the percentage of home-owning households rose to 69.2 percent from 64.2 percent, according to the Census Bureau. What's the point of measuring rents if fewer and fewer people are actually renting?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, shifts in Americans' relative desire to own rather than rent can play havoc with inflation measures. Rising home prices -- and rising interest in owning homes -- have helped to keep housing rents in check in recent years. So even though the rampant housing market is forcing home buyers to cough up more of their income for the same amount of shelter, the comparatively soft rental market is holding down inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CONVERSELY, when housing prices fall, a trend that most people would deem anti-inflationary, and renting becomes more attractive than owning, the index might process the information as evidence that inflation is on the rise. ''We got a great deal of criticism that we were overstating inflation in the early 1990's, because housing prices were declining and rents were going up steadily,'' Mr. Jackman said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market today is a polarizing force. On one side are those who are convinced that the market is a bubble about to pop. On the other side are those who believe that we are in the midst of a long-term boom. But at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Mr. Jackman notes, ''We're pretty much conditioned to be in the middle.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, June 23 -- Sales of existing homes slowed in May but were still at the second-highest level on record with home prices reaching an all-time high.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes and condominiums edged down 0.7 percent last month, the National Association of Realtors reported on Thursday. The decline left sales at a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 7.13 million units, down from a 7.18 million sales pace in April.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with the small drop in sales, median home prices nationwide rose to another all-time high of $207,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Lereah, the Realtors' chief economist, said he was concerned about borrowers' reliance on interest-only mortgages and other mortgages with low down payments. Both kinds of loans would leave borrowers vulnerable if home prices slid in areas where they had been sharpest.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other economic news, the Labor Department reported Thursday that the number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits fell by 20,000 last week, to 314,000. The improvement was far better than the drop of 3,000 that analysts expected.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The four-week moving average of jobless claims, which tends to smooth out volatility, eased to 333,000 from 335,500 the previous week.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of new homes rose 0.2 percent in May, the Commerce Department said yesterday, as low mortgage rates and an improved job market kept home builders on pace for their best year since 1978.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders broke ground at an annual rate of 2.009 million housing units last month, the fastest since February, after 2.005 million in April.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two other reports showed that new claims for jobless benefits rose slightly last week, and that manufacturing contracted in the Philadelphia region this month for the first time in two years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in housing starts adds to the evidence of strength in real estate as home sales head for a fifth consecutive record year and prices escalate, prompting Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, to worry about speculative ''froth.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits, a sign of future construction, fell 4.6 percent in May to an annual rate of 2.05 million units. April's rate of 2.148 million was the highest in more than three decades.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family home starts rose 4.7 percent in May, to an annual pace of 1.704 million units, the fourth highest on record. Starts of town houses, apartments and other multifamily dwellings fell 19 percent, to a 305,000 rate.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starts increased in all regions but the South, where they fell 12 percent, to an annual rate of 903,000 units. Starts rose 12 percent in the West, to 540,000. They rose 19 percent in the Midwest, to 381,000, and 5.1 percent in the Northeast, to 185,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential construction grew at an annual rate of 8.8 percent in the first quarter, faster than the 3.5 percent rate for the economy in general.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction has accounted for 141,000 of the 898,000 jobs added in the United States this year, and more hiring is likely. Manpower Inc. said this week that hiring expectations for the third quarter were highest among construction companies, with 43 percent planning to add workers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also yesterday, the Labor Department reported that the number of workers filing initial applications for unemployment benefits rose by 1,000 last week, to 333,000. The level remains consistent with gradual improvement in the job market, economists said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia reported yesterday that its regional factory index for June fell to minus 2.2. It was the first negative reading, signifying contraction, since May 2003. A report this week from the New York Fed showed expansion. The Philadelphia Fed's outlook index for six months from now rose to 30.6, the highest this year, indicating the slowdown may be temporary.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By TERI KARUSH ROGERS  </div><div>1794 words</div><div>12 June 2005</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2005 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AFTER a torrid first quarter that spun the sales prices of Manhattan apartments to breathtaking highs, anecdotal evidence suggests that the headiness has started to dissipate. While the jig is hardly up, brokers are saying that the tempo resembles a more seasonable waltz, and that there are signs of growing price resistance among buyers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices are still rising, but more slowly, and the market is still strong, just not as crazy. ''It's been an overheated market for so long that it is a slowdown, but this slowdown is kind of like what we used to have all the time, which is a normal market,'' said Deanna Kory, a senior vice president at the Corcoran Group, echoing the views of most of the 25 real estate brokers and executives interviewed for this article across a broad range of firms and price points.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spring slowdown -- variously referred to as a correction, softening, pause, seasonal adjustment, breather and normalization -- was typically discussed in tones of relief rather than alarm. ''In a way, it had to happen,'' said Ms. Kory, noting that the market since 2002 ''got a little out of hand -- it got crazy.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't see it as a bad thing,'' she said. ''It's only bad for sellers who expected to get a certain price.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many apartments priced by tacking an extra 10 percent or more onto first-quarter comparables are lingering on the market, prompting 5 to 10 percent reductions during the last few weeks, especially among family-sized dwellings above $1.5 million, and particularly on the Upper East Side, where there is said to be a recent surplus of inventory. Brokers reported that in many cases, open-house attendance has lagged significantly behind the outsized crowds in the early part of the year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are still bidding wars on certain properties -- something that's unique or totally done in a way that's very outstanding in a hot area -- but you're not seeing it on everything,'' said Dottie Herman, president and chief executive of Prudential Douglas Elliman, who, like some others, declined to categorize the shift as a slowdown. ''People do not feel the same feeling, and that has a lot to do with the papers,'' she added, referring to a mounting news media chorus about a possible housing bubble.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For buyers, relief is mixed. Juggernaut competition may be easing, but prices aren't necessarily retreating below first-quarter levels. Jonathan J. Miller, president of Miller Samuel, a Manhattan-based real estate appraiser, noted that while the volume of deals appears flat, ''purchase prices are still pushing the envelope across the board'' among contracts signed as recently as two weeks ago. ''Some of the sizzle might be off the steak, but the steak is still very expensive,'' said Pamela Liebman, chief executive and president of Corcoran, adding, ''What tells you if prices are going up is the price per square foot.'' She said that data from the firm's signed contracts show condo and co-op prices per square foot of $1,003 in March, $1,016 in April and $1,009 in May.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But buyers, perhaps fueled by the bubble press, are mounting more resistance.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Right now, buyers are daring to put offers that are under the asking price -- I just got one for 8 percent under asking,'' said Jacky Teplitzky, an executive vice president at Prudential Douglas Elliman, who held six open houses last weekend for family-sized apartments from $1.2 million to $1.6 million on the Upper East and West Sides, and in Murray Hill. Like her May open houses, attendance trailed by one-half to two-thirds the number typically attracted earlier in the year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Before, we had more volume and more offers coming to the table,'' she said. ''Usually after an open house, we would get two, three or four offers. Now, we get maybe one offer after the first or second open house.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More buyers ''are offering ask or slightly over ask,'' said Veronica Raehse, an executive vice president and sales manager at Bellmarc Realty's West Side office. ''Two months ago, where they were going $100,000 over ask, it's maybe only $25,000 to $30,000 now.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loftiest end of the market is said to be showing the most strain.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I do think we're at the end of one of our cycles,'' said Kirk Henckels, a director and senior vice president of Stribling Private Brokerage, who described interest in the $4 million-and-up market as muted by ''some extraordinary overpricing lately'' and a ''pitifully low'' inventory. ''No one wants to go shopping in a store with nothing in it,'' he said, explaining that while some well-priced properties are still going quickly, he expects price reductions of 1 to 2 percent over the summer. ''This is a very value-oriented market.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miller, whose appraisals include dwellings in the superluxury category, agreed. ''We're not seeing the intensity, the frequency of bidding wars,'' he said. ''There's a little bit longer marketing time for these properties. And that's partially because a significant portion of the inventory coming online over the past couple of years has addressed that segment, so that supply has tempered the frenzy.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, while new condo units under $2 million are selling briskly, properties above that are taking longer, said Andy Gerringer, a managing director and the head of new development projects at Prudential Douglas Elliman.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The picture appears brighter, though not entirely cloudless, at the lower end of the real estate food chain. Brokers report brisk sales of properties costing less than $1 million. ''In our bread and butter, the $350,000-to-$750,000 market, things are O.K.,'' said Neil J. Binder, president of Bellmarc, citing falling mortgage rates as a motivating factor. He said his firm's inventory has jumped by 25 percent recently.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't see the same appreciation as last year,'' Mr. Binder said, ''but I do see a strong market. Last year they opened the door and there's five offers. Today they open the door and they have to do a little song and dance.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Ms. Herman of Prudential Douglas Elliman noted, ''Anything at the low end of the market is always going to sell because there's always more people at that end of the pyramid.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two listings held by Laura Matiz, a senior vice president in Bellmarc's East Side office, illustrate the schism that many see separating the two ends of the market. Both dwellings are in postwar Upper East Side buildings. The pricier one -- a two-bedroom 1,600-square-foot ''condop,'' a hybrid between a co-op and a condominium, on the 40th floor in a full-service building on East 89th Street near Fifth Avenue -- went for its asking price of $2.35 million on April 1, in a two-way bidding war. But both bids fell through later that month, and the apartment has garnered no further offers, despite a price drop to $2.1 million. Rather than carry it vacant, the investor-owner is considering taking it off the market and renting it out for $9,000 a month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contrast this to the fate of a $299,000 studio on East 79th Street near York Avenue. The co-op, on the first floor of a full-service building, was sold in March near its asking price. The board rejected the buyer a few days after Memorial Day, and Ms. Matiz held an impromptu open house that weekend advertised only online. ''I got probably 12 people and three offers; it was a good crowd for a beautiful, hot summer afternoon,'' said Ms. Matiz, who predicted that the apartment will go into contract above asking price.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elaine Clayman, a senior vice president at Brown Harris Stevens with 15 listings in the $475,000-to-$750,000 range, said activity in the sector had quickened just since Memorial Day.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other brokers, reporting a post-Memorial-Day rise in activity, were hopeful that the bubble coverage had worked its way through buyers' psyches. But the experience may have empowered buyers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jerry Minsky, a senior vice president for Corcoran in Brooklyn, said that in a five-day period after Memorial Day, four buyers of properties in the $300,000-to-$700,000 range tried to lower their bids by 25 to 30 percent after signing contracts at asking price.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The buyers all systematically came back for cuts after they negotiated their contract, on the advice of their lawyer or mortgage broker,'' said Mr. Minsky, who advised his sellers to stand firm but said he could not predict whether they would.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is no economic reasoning behind this so-called bubble,'' he said. Mr. Minsky echoed others who noted that the fundamentals supporting New York's real estate market appear solid: low inventory, low mortgage rates and a decent economy. And, like others, he said he believed the spate of media coverage of a frothy housing market stoked anxiety during what is really a natural, seasonal slowing heading into the summer months. In fact, he said: ''I never got four or five bids a week in June. So where's the bubble?''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether one exists may be beside the point. The direction of the market is also a state of mind.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People have to hear it from several people about how things are different now, and then they change their minds,'' said Robert J. Shiller, the author of ''Irrational Exuberance'' (Princeton University Press; second edition, 2005) and a professor of economics at Yale University. Mr. Shiller shared the results of a Lexis-Nexis search he conducted among major newspapers: In May, 77 articles contained the words ''housing bubble,'' nearly double the 40 logged in April.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The market is so inertial that it just keeps going in the same direction, unlike the stock market,'' said Mr. Shiller, noting that real estate values have pushed northward for eight years, ''a huge trend.'' But if a drumbeat of public anxiety over housing values reverses the trend, the downward momentum could prove equally implacable.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think there's a good chance that this is the end of the boom,'' he added, ''because it can't go on forever.''  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Look, up in the air! Is it a bubble? Is it froth? It's Manhattan real estate prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if there is kryptonite out there that could bring the gravity-defying housing market crashing to earth, it has not surfaced yet, as sales prices for apartments hit new highs last month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price for all sales in Manhattan that closed last month was $750,000, which was 23 percent higher than the median price for May 2004, according to a monthly market report prepared by Halstead Property, a real estate brokerage.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average price also reached a new high, at $1,276,202, which was 34 percent higher than the average price the same month a year ago. The report is based on 674 sales of co-ops and condos.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales in May were generally the product of contracts signed two or three months earlier, so the figures most accurately reflect market conditions in the first few months of the year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the report also showed that last month, the extremely tight supply of apartments for sale in some neighborhoods, like the Upper West Side, may have begun to ease.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If we look at the conditions going on in the last couple of months, they were very favorable to price appreciation,'' said Gregory J. Heym, the chief economist at Halstead. He said that large end-of-the-year Wall Street bonuses, low interest rates and the small number of apartments on the market helped fuel high prices in the first half of the year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think we don't expect prices to continue to rise at this pace, however, we don't see a bubble bursting either,'' he said. ''I don't recall a real estate bubble ever bursting that wasn't preceded by bad economic conditions or some dramatic shock, and nobody is predicting any of that right now.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the Upper West Side, according to the report, apartment listings fell 2 percent compared with the listings for May 2004. But that was a significant change from April, when new listings were down 14 percent from the previous year, and in March, when they were 26 percent lower.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New listings for smaller apartments dropped most sharply on the Upper West Side. There were 45 new listings for studios in the neighborhood in May, compared with 57 the year before, a drop of 21 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April, 36 studios became available on the Upper West Side. There were 116 new listings for one-bedroom apartments in the neighborhood in May, compared with 128 new listings in the same month in 2004, a 9 percent decrease.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across town, new listings on the Upper East Side were down 8 percent in May, which was lower than the new listings in May 2004. But that is less extreme than the 16 percent drop in new inventory in April.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As real estate prices continue to reach new heights, concern has risen that there might be a bubble in the market that could pop and lead to a crash in home values. Last month, the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, helped stoke fears by saying that some metropolitan areas were showing signs of ''froth'' in the real estate market, referring to some local markets that have had high increases in prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, many professionals in the New York market predict a more gradual change.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The interesting thing we're seeing is, it's a very stable, brisk market,'' said Steven B. Schnall, the president of the New York Mortgage Company, a mortgage lender. Mr. Schnall pointed to continued low interest rates as the most important factor in the market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't see prices continuing to skyrocket,'' he said. ''They've reached a very high level and this almost appears to be a new normal, and interest rates are helping that.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEDFORD, N.Y. -- Earlier this month, Michael Neeley, a real estate broker in this leafy, upscale suburb, closed on the sale of a contemporary ranch house. A few days later, the sellers of that house bought another, larger ranch house.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, in a chain reaction, the sellers of the larger house closed on a $900,000 four-bedroom new colonial house. Mr. Neeley had a stake in all three deals, as well as the sale of two more homes, both for prices well above $1 million. In less than two weeks, he said he cleared nearly $98,000 in commissions, after splitting with other brokers and his firm.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real estate boom has been good to agents like Mr. Neeley. Last year, he helped sell 48 houses, worth an aggregate of $56.7 million. This sum was nearly seven times the value of what he sold five years ago and more than any other agent in northern Westchester County, according to an analysis of multiple-listing data. He said he earned close to $900,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I always wanted my business to grow,'' said Mr. Neeley, 51, as he pulled away from an open house in his white Bentley Arnage this month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the housing market has fueled the economy over the last five years, top real estate agents have been among the biggest beneficiaries. Until recently, the neighbors who drove the best cars, wore the best clothes and gave the best dinner parties were doctors, lawyers, bankers and stockbrokers. But now, with house prices skyrocketing and homes in the hottest markets selling in a matter of days, some real estate brokers are enjoying incomes and lifestyles that approach those of their wealthiest clients.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their success is inspiring a new generation of prospective sales agents, although the likelihood is high that many of them will not earn a decent living at it. Already, there are too many brokers. But the best and most experienced ones with proven track records are having a run beyond their wildest dreams.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The real estate business used to be primarily housewives supplementing their husband's salaries by showing and selling a couple of houses a year,'' said Dan Ginnel, president of Ginnel Real Estate, which is based in Bedford Hills, where Mr. Neeley works. ''Now some of these agents are selling over 50 houses and making investment banking-type salaries in their hometown in the home industry,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to the Bentley, Mr. Neeley's blossoming wealth has allowed him to buy four Mercedeses, two Jaguars and two Range Rovers. He spends lavishly on theater tickets, Tiffany jewelry, Louis Vuitton belts and shoes, and owns 28 pairs of Alain Mikli eyeglasses, which are color-coordinated with his wardrobe.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although real estate commissions -- typically 5 or 6 percent of the sale price -- have come under pressure as discount brokers have offered stripped-down services for as little as 2 percent, traditional brokers have held back the spread of cheaper online services, in part by restricting access to the property listings that brokers in a region share. Meanwhile, the volume of homes sold, coupled with increased sale prices, has helped lift total commission revenues over the last few years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate agents in the United States collected $61.1 billion in commissions last year, up 43 percent from $42.6 billion in 2000, said Steve Murray, editor of Real Trends, a real estate industry newsletter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the most frenzied markets, some are making sums that recall the bonanzas enjoyed by stockbrokers in the late 1990's. In Manhattan, the best real estate agents cleared over $2 million last year, said Pamela Liebman, the chief executive of the Corcoran Group.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everything is going for the superstars in these markets,'' said Susan M. Wachter, professor of real state at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. ''The market's hot, the prices are high and if they have the Rolodex, they can just keep it going. Until, of course, it all stops, which may happen. This is the kind of industry that is cyclical.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some agents are finding that their social status has risen along with their newfound wealth. ''You see it by the places they dine at, the clothes they wear and what they perceive as their familiarity with clients,'' said Hilah R. Iaulus, a real estate lawyer and an adjunct associate professor at the New York University Real Estate Institute. Clients see their brokers ''much less like a person who is serving them and much more like a comrade or friend.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such camaraderie has not changed the general impression that the public has of real estate agents. While the National Association of Realtors cites a survey it commissioned of public perceptions showing that Realtors rank higher than lawyers, a Harris Poll last year found that real estate brokers ranked the lowest of all professions, below accountants, stockbrokers and journalists, in terms of prestige. Such a poor image likely comes from the fact that agents earn their livings from commissions on closed deals, sometimes creating the perception that they will say or do anything to sell a house.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Neeley said he believed that real estate agents had improved their image. ''Real estate to me is a profession, whereas before it was just sales,'' he said. ''My image and people's perception of me is very important.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he always socialized with clients, but only recently has he earned an income that matched theirs. ''I look at how they spend their money and I'm getting more ideas,'' said Mr. Neeley.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only a small fraction of real estate brokers ever break into the highest income brackets. Mr. Murray of Real Trends said that fewer than a third of all agents make more than the median United States household income of around $43,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, many real estate agents make barely anything at all. In Westchester, for example, there were 9,701 licensed brokers and sales agents in 2004, up 23 percent from 7,864 in 2000. Taking into account the fact that agents like Mr. Neeley sold dozens of the 6,157 single-family homes bought in Westchester last year, many agents in the county likely sold no homes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The oversupply of brokers has not stopped more people from flocking to the industry. ''When you see headlines about median prices continuing to grow, it attracts attention,'' said Richard Haggerty, deputy executive officer of the Westchester County Board of Realtors. ''A lot of people become intrigued by that and go ahead and get their licenses.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alexa McInerney, 24, is one of them. To her, real estate represents an easy way to make quick cash. ''Everyone I see I say, 'You should get your license,''' said Ms. McInerney, who also works in Westchester. ''I tell them, 'What's so wrong with free money?'''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Mr. Neeley, formerly a financial planner, decided in the late 1980's that he wanted to change careers, he chose to go to law school. ''I was attracted to the power and the control,'' he said. ''I thought it would boost my self esteem.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To put himself through law school, Mr. Neeley bought, renovated and sold homes in and around Bedford and nearby Pound Ridge, where he grew up. At the time, he considered real estate to be a part-time job, not a full-time career.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The experience gave him the taste for real estate. By the time he finished law school, he did not want to spend his day at a desk, and decided to try his hand at selling houses. Having grown up in the community, he quickly built a roster of clients.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But by 2001, a drinking problem was undermining his work. Four years ago, he joined a 12-step alcoholic recovery program and stopped drinking.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That coincided with the dramatic run-up in the housing market. ''In the old days, it took six months to sell a listing,'' said Mr. Neeley, who sold just 11 houses in 2000. In the past couple of years, ''after two weeks, if it has not sold, we start to worry whether it is priced right.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He often earns more than one commission from a client because a seller is frequently a buyer, too. One morning earlier this month, Mr. Neeley accompanied Lauren Sugar, whose home is listed with him, to view a house he thought she and her husband might be interested in buying.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After she spent 45 minutes touring the $1.395 million four-bedroom, contemporary-style house, Ms. Sugar said she wanted to bring her husband back the next day.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the drive back to the sales office, she asked Mr. Neeley about his strategy for selling her current house, which has been on the market for $2.9 million since March. Mr. Neeley explained that inventories of high-end properties were climbing, and suggested she let him give a party at the house for other agents.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Neeley is famous for how he woos other brokers. At open houses, he gives out bottles of wine, gift certificates for manicures and car washes, and Mary Kay cosmetics. At some of his choicest properties, he gives evening parties for agents, serving wine or cocktails and food. (He sticks to bottled water.)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a lot of time spent on weekends and evenings,'' said Mr. Neeley. He never stops for lunch and clients who call to leave voice mail messages at 9 p.m. are surprised that he answers the phone. He is about to get busier: he has signed on with a firm in New Canaan so that he can sell homes in Connecticut, while continuing to work as a broker for Ginnel in New York.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, Mr. Neeley said he was so busy selling houses that he did not have time to buy one of his own. He rents half of a house owned by Mr. Ginnel and spends some nights in a rented apartment in Southport, Conn.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have owned a lot of houses in the past and I got too involved with fixing them up,'' he said. ''It took away from being able to sell real estate.''  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GOT a million-dollar home?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ho-hum.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">United States Census Bureau data released on Tuesday shows that Connecticut had the second-highest percentage of homes valued at more than $1 million when the survey was conducted in 2003. An estimated 29,270 homes in Connecticut had seven-figure price tags, compared with 12,926 in 2000. Fully 3.3 percent of Connecticut's homes were valued by their owners at more than $1 million, second only to California, with 4.1 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More recent data also shows that fears of an imminent real estate bust may have been premature.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It hasn't dried up yet,'' said Michael Casey, a Realtor with William Raveis International in Greenwich.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, median prices for existing homes, a category which does not include newly built ones, increased by 15.1 percent in April compared to last year, according to the National Association of Realtors. In Connecticut, prices rose about 7.8 percent in the first quarter of 2005, according to John Clapp, a professor of finance and real estate at the University of Connecticut School of Business. Dr. Clapp adjusts housing data based on variables such as the location and the size of the house to come up with what he considers a more accurate measurement.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Connecticut Association of Realtors has not released data from the first quarter of 2005, but fourth-quarter median prices from last year were 16.2 percent higher than they were at the end of 2003.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In select markets, million-dollar homes are becoming increasingly common. In Stamford, according to Dr. Clapp's first-quarter data, 20 percent of homes were priced for more than $1.3 million and 10 percent at more than $1.8 million. In Greenwich, about 55 percent of homes have sold for between $1 million and $3 million this year, Mr. Casey said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fairfield County's median home prices ranked 17th in the nation for counties with at least 250,000 people, according to the Census survey.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some ways, the continuing price increases seem counterintuitive. At least in Greenwich, more houses are up for sale and houses have been staying on the market longer, but prices continue to go up. Because of interest rates, Mr. Casey said, deals are still good.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest rates have hovered around 6 percent. Bob Fiorito, the president of the Connecticut Association of Realtors, said that is still far from the level that would deter buyers. ''As long as interest rates stay below 8.5 percent, I don't think you'll see an appreciable effect on the market,'' Mr. Fiorito said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, some think growth is slowing down from the consistent double-digit price increases of the past few years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think what we're seeing is more of a leveling off,'' Mr. Casey said. ''Maybe we're going from 100 m.p.h. to 80 m.p.h., but we're still going forward.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Clapp expects some of the higher-priced markets to lose momentum. There may not be a widespread slide in prices, but certain areas that have boomed, such as Stamford, could get hit hard if interest rates rise, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are certain areas where you might have some shakeouts coming up,'' he said.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By DAVID LEONHARDT  </div><div>1280 words</div><div>25 May 2005</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2005 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices rose more quickly over the last year than at any point since 1980, a national group of Realtors reported yesterday, raising new questions about whether some local housing markets may be turning into bubbles destined to burst.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With mortgage rates still low and job growth accelerating, the real estate market is defying yet another round of predictions that it was on the verge of cooling. The number of homes sold also jumped in April, after having been flat for almost a year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, the median price for sales of existing homes, which does not factor in newly built ones, rose to $206,000 last month, up 15.1 percent over the last year and breaking the $200,000 level for the first time, the National Association of Realtors said. Adjusted for inflation, the median price -- the point at which half cost more and half cost less -- has increased more than a third since 2000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've had robust markets before,'' said Maurice J. Veissi, the president of a real estate agency in Miami, who has been a broker for 30 years. ''But this one is so much broader and deeper.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even before this surge, housing prices had risen more steeply over the last 10 years than during any such period since World War II. A growing number of economists worry that real estate is to this decade what technology stocks were to the 1990's, with many people assuming that home values will rise forever.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, home prices have never fallen by a significant amount, and Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said on Friday that a national drop in price remained unlikely. But they have sometimes fallen sharply in certain locations, including New York and Los Angeles, and Mr. Greenspan, in his strongest warning to date, stated that some metropolitan areas were clearly showing signs of ''froth.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having been sanguine about real estate in recent years, Mr. Greenspan began to change his tone in March, when he cited some analysts' concern that the housing market might ''implode.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices continue to rise most rapidly in the places where they are already highest, including Florida, the Boston-Washington corridor and along the West Coast. In the late 1980's, a typical house in San Diego cost about as much as two typical houses in Syracuse, according to the Realtors' association; today, someone could buy six Syracuse houses for the price of one in San Diego.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices have jumped most sharply over the last year in the West -- up 21 percent in April from a year earlier, compared with an increase of 14 percent in the calendar year 2004. Price increases also accelerated in the Midwest, to almost 13 percent, while they remained roughly similar in the Northeast at 16 percent, and the South, where they are up about 8 percent compared with a year earlier.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report, the Census Bureau said Tuesday that the percentage of homes worth at least a million dollars had almost doubled from 2000 to 2003. California had the highest share of million-dollar homes in 2003, with more than 4 percent valued above that amount. It was followed by Connecticut; Washington, D.C.; Massachusetts; and New York, where an estimated 2.1 percent of the homes were valued at more than $1 million. Nationally, 1 percent are worth more than that.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's clearly speculative excess going on,'' said Joshua Shapiro, the chief United States economist at MFR Inc., an economic research group in New York. ''A lot of people view real estate as a can't lose.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until the April surge, the overall housing market had seemed to have reached a plateau. Economists, even some working for real estate lobbying groups, predicted that sales would decline a little in 2005 and prices would rise more modestly.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even as the Fed has steadily lifted its benchmark short-term interest rate, mortgage rates have remained low. The average interest rate for a 30-year fixed loan is now 5.71 percent, down from 6.30 percent a year ago, according to Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored mortgage buyer.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates are closely tied to the market for long-term government bonds, which are benefiting from purchases by foreign governments, particularly in Asia, that continue to buy Treasury bonds, as well as from investors looking for a haven from risky corporate securities.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the economy has gained strength this year, the still low rates and creative financing arrangements appear to have wooed a new group of homebuyers into the market. Some are trading up to larger houses, while others are buying a vacation homes or putting money into real estate simply as an investment.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Mortgage rates are doing this,'' said David A. Lereah, chief economist of the Realtors' association. ''They're near historic lows.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of existing homes that changed hands in April increased 4.5 percent, the biggest monthly gain since early 2004. Sales of condominiums, particularly popular among real estate speculators, rose faster than sales of free-standing homes. Condo prices rose faster, too.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To economists worried about a bubble, the growing gap between house prices and almost everything else -- rents, incomes, population growth -- is the surest sign of trouble. A typical apartment, for example, costs less to rent than it did five years ago, taking inflation into account, according to the National Real Estate Index, which is published by Global Real Analytics, a research company based in San Francisco.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last time that house prices increased more than 15 percent over a 12-month period was in 1980, according to the Realtors' group. But overall inflation was also high at the time, helping to drive home values higher as well. Inflation has been modest in recent years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Shapiro of MFR said that even a moderate rise in mortgage rates now had the potential to cause a price decline in some expensive markets. A rate increase would change the calculation for people buying residential real estate as an investment, he said, and could make other buyers realize that the recent price jumps could not continue.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But other economists predict that powerful demographic forces will keep prices increasing in most of the country. Many baby boomers are buying second homes, and their children -- like many immigrants who have arrived in the last generation -- are destined, in this view, to buy their first, continuing to stoke demand.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction companies have also avoided the kind of overbuilding that plagued some regions during the real estate downturn of the early 1990's. Fewer than 2.5 million homes remained on the market in April, equal to only about four months' worth of home sales, and that is near a record low.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Obviously, there are some local bubbles,'' said Mr. Lereah, of the Realtors' group, who called last month's price increase unsustainable. ''But I tend to think that with most of the bubbles, the air will come out slowly, rather than popping.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AS the passion for investing in real estate has intensified, the Internet has become a crucial tool for investors. It allows them to sit at home in New York or Los Angeles and type in search words that lead them to another world, seemingly infinite in possibilities for house shopping.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To make sure that those shoppers discover him, Steve Barbey, a real estate agent from Boise, Idaho, has spent $100,000 on Web addresses related to Boise and its surrounding area. He has bought 800 domain names,, paying $50,000 for a single address: BoiseRealEstate.com.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Ron Jackson, editor of Domain Name Journal, it is not unusual for a real estate professional to own a dozen or more names. But Saul Klein, a San Diego consultant who helps real estate agents become Internet-savvy, said that only a few seem to have amassed hundreds.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Barbey's strategy seems to be paying off. Last year, he said, he got more than 1,000 solid leads via the Internet, including 80 from investors who were not locals looking for homes. Some investors have bought homes without ever setting foot in Idaho.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four years ago, Mr. Barbey moved with his wife, Laurie, and two young children from Los Angeles to the Boise suburbs. His wife had relatives there and they loved the area. At first he thought he might put his high-technology skills to work devising sales and marketing plans for real estate offices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But one glance at the galloping pace of home sales prompted him to go directly into the market and become a broker. He is now a partner with John Davidson, a native of Boise and a broker specializing in the suburb of Eagle.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, Mr. Barbey has been busy selling houses -- he did $13 million in Idaho residential sales last year -- and rolling out sites for his main dot-com addresses.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Barbey's goal is to channel Web surfers to his sites. For example, anyone who types ''idahorealestate.com'' into a Google search box lands on a page owned by Mr. Barbey that directs visitors to his main site, yourIdahohome.com.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Different search engines -- Google, MSN, Yahoo, etc. -- use different algorithms to determine Web site ranking on the search results pages,'' he said. He wants his Web address to ''show up on the first screen and preferably toward the top,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His Web site,  www.youridahohome.com [http://www.youridahohome.com], caught the attention of Al Lorenzen, a project manager for a credit card company in the San Francisco Bay area. It was ''well laid out and user friendly,'' Mr. Lorenzen said. He reached it surfing Realtor.com and the Multiple Listing Service (run by the local Board of Realtors).  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lorenzen got in touch with Mr. Barbey, who outlined a strategy to zero in on rental property in Mr. Lorenzen's price range. The agent followed up with photos and a DVD narrated by Mr. Davidson, his partner, and suggested a property management company. They traded faxes and FedEx packages. Within a few months, Mr. Lorenzen had paid cash and closed on a $125,000 house in a Boise subdivision.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lorenzen said he had decided to buy real estate as an alternative to stocks and bonds. ''If I was smarter, I would have pulled all of my money out of the stock market four years ago,'' he said. He was inspired to move forward with the Idaho brokers because, he said, they ''can speak in complete sentences'' and ''answered every question I had about the Boise area.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another client, Dr. Robert Eitches of Beverly Hills, Calif., said that he has never even been to Idaho. But Dr. Eitches, an assistant professor of medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine at U.C.L.A., bought three houses in the Boise region through Mr. Barbey. He conducted all business by e-mail, telephone, fax and FedEx.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Barbey ''showed'' Dr. Eitches 12 properties via the Web and helped him make offers on four; three were accepted. The broker then helped to arrange mortgages on the houses, after 25 percent was put down. ''I did it because the stock market is unreliable'' as a ''retirement nest egg,'' Dr. Eitches said. ''In 15 years they'll probably be earning me $1,500 to $2,000 a month each.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before investing in Boise, Mr. Lorenzen and Dr. Eitches investigated other areas closer to home. Mr. Lorenzen was interested in Las Vegas (the fastest growing city in the United States, according to the Census Bureau) but said he could not find a broker there who was as willing or knowledgeable as Mr. Barbey.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, he decided the Boise area, with a population of 338,800, was a better bet for investing. Housing prices in Las Vegas in 2004 spiraled up 50 percent, making it overheated in the eyes of trackers like Richard DeKaser, the chief economist for the National City Corporation in Cleveland, while Boise's real estate is regarded as fairly priced. Boise has been highly ranked recently for its job creation, its affordability and its business climate, according to Shirl Boyce, a vice president of the Boise Valley Economic Partnership.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Yun, senior economist with the National Association of Realtors, said Boise was expected to do better than the nation as a whole in 2005. Characterizing it as a small city with potential, Mr. Yun said that although existing home sales were up by more than 20 percent in 2004, ''there 's still much more room to grow in Idaho compared to West Coast cities from San Diego to Seattle.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Barbey and Mr. Davidson, like others in their region, already use traditional methods to compete for commissions in the Boise-area market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The capital of Idaho, Boise is also the industrial, white-collar and medical hub of a relatively isolated area -- Salt Lake City is about 300 miles away; Portland, Ore., 343. When Mr. Barbey arrived, there was already a spurt in residential building, notably in Meridian and Eagle.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the highest-priced homes are in Eagle, where Mr. Barbey, 32, sits in front of a triple-screen computer monitor and fields e-mail messages from potential buyers, most of them local buyers looking for new homes. The view from his office window of the tree-lined North Fork of the Boise River and surrounding forest is a soothing contrast to the one he had from his office at Blue Falcon Networks in Los Angeles.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It sat in the old, decrepit part of downtown,'' he said. ''Outside there were trash, vagrants, honking horns and the occasional gunshot.'' His daily commute was 90 minutes each way in California; in Eagle, it is 5.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Located directly northwest of Boise proper, Eagle has about 14,000 people, and the average home price last year was $340,000, compared with $193,000 for the Boise region in general, according to Chris Mooney, executive vice president of the Ada County Association of Realtors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor is Eagle's prosperity an accident, according to Mayor Nancy Merrill. About a decade ago, she said, the town asked itself, ''What do we want to be when we grow up?''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 25-year master plan mandated large single-family home lots, plenty of open space and subdivisions with clubhouses, swimming pools, walking paths and extensive landscaping, which have lured executives and their families to its expansive new homes. These people are his target market, Mr. Barbey said, as well as the investors he hopes to lure from the Internet.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They got what for that house? But it's got no yard, the kitchen is a 50's nightmare and the closets are pathetic.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So goes many a wide-eyed conversation these days, whether in city, suburb, exurb or way-beyond-urb.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many regions, homes are the new technology stocks, with frenzied speculators buying and selling real estate as if they were playing a hot new video game.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some calmer heads may be tempted to cash in now but for the inconvenient fact that they would then have no place to lay their suddenly wealthy heads.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why do prices keep defying gravity -- and, possibly, reason? Could it be denial? A recent Experian-Gallup survey showed that 65 percent of Americans had never heard of a possible ''housing bubble,'' and 12 percent had heard ''only a little.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, 70 percent expect prices to keep climbing in the next year, with only 5 percent allowing for the unthinkable possibility of prices actually slipping.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WRAP some dental floss around a 10-ton boulder. Clamp one end in your teeth. Now haul the boulder up a steep hill. Backward.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's what it can be like for middle-income people trying to find a home they can afford on Long Island, where the average single-family house sells for nearly $400,000 while the median annual income for a family of four is about $90,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using the rule of thumb for affordability -- two and one-half years' worth of income -- that median family would safely be able to pay no more than $225,000 for a house, and prices like that have all but disappeared from the Island's real estate market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the boulder-and-dental-floss image can also apply to the efforts by a growing number of housing advocates, politicians and business people across the Island to address the housing-cost problem.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The obstacles range widely, from financial hurdles like high land and building costs, rising interest rates and tight federal and state budgets to essentially political problems like Nimbyism, red tape and partisan bickering. Local residents worry about the impact of subsidized housing on schools, tax rolls, traffic, the environment -- and the value of their own homes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even among those who would directly benefit from housing initiatives, there can be conflicts between the interests of two distinct constituencies: lower-income people who cannot find an affordable rental, and middle-income people who cannot find an affordable house to buy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's enough to make housing advocates throw up their hands in despair -- except, they say, that the situation has grown so dire that inaction would be even worse, with serious consequences for the Island.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have an emergency on our hands,'' said Jay Schneiderman, a Suffolk legislator. He is the chairman of the County Legislature's housing committee and is a member of the county executive's Workforce Housing Commission. ''No one seems to know what to call it -- a crisis, a problem -- but it looks like a real emergency to me.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Concerns over housing costs have become so universal on the Island that nearly every community from North Hempstead to East Hampton now has a municipal housing authority, a private or civic organization and at least one other governmental body whose mission is to find or create more low-cost housing. But the going has been slow.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the town authorities, which focus mainly on public rental housing, were in operation long before the current run-up in housing costs, and their efforts usually have at least as much to do with combating poverty and discrimination as with affordability more generally. The authorities are often hamstrung by tight budgets and cuts in federal and state aid, and many of them have long waiting lists for subsidized apartments that current tenants are ever more reluctant to leave.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newer efforts like the Suffolk task force and a Nassau County housing initiative are concerned more with owner-occupied housing and with encouraging private-sector solutions.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, the Southampton Town Board is trying to overhaul its zoning code to encourage landowners and developers to make more low-price units available. One amendment would make it easier to win approval for new multifamily buildings. Another would allow accessory apartments -- often called mother-in-law apartments -- in new houses.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Opposition from residents has been intense, and the board has held seven contentious hearings on the proposals so far, the most recent last Tuesday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm 100 percent for affordable housing, but not for what this law proposes,'' said Al Algieri, the president of the East Quogue Civic Association. He and others said at a hearing April 26 that they were worried about overcrowded schools, overburdened public services, high property taxes and heavy traffic, problems that new housing could make worse.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later in the hearing, Mr. Algieri expanded the list to include self-preservation for owners who could not afford to buy their houses in today's market and who could lose them to higher taxes. ''We're trying to create affordable housing without destroying the people who don't have affordable housing.'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John White, the town's housing director, said in an interview that Southampton had tried to address residents' concerns by amending its proposals. ''We certainly can't satisfy everyone, but we can try to create the best balance we can,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Nassau, County Executive Thomas R. Suozzi's $10 million plan to help municipalities and private developers create more housing in traditional downtown areas has likewise met with mixed reviews. Some critics say that minority neighborhoods will wind up bearing the brunt of the plan. And Republicans in the legislature have called it a boondoggle.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, there is wide agreement that prices for most single-family homes on Long Island have risen out of reach, not just for the poor but also for middle-income people.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Right now, the middle class is completely priced out of the Long Island market,'' said Lee E. Koppelman, the chairman of the Long Island Regional Planning Board and the director of the Center for Regional Planning Studies at Stony Brook University.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the trend continues, Dr. Koppelman said, economic growth will suffer. Businesses cannot expand without new workers, and cannot attract them if they cannot find a place to live, he said. ''After that, everything else goes downhill rather quickly.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the American Dream suburbs that grew up after World War II, subsidized housing acquired a stigma from its association with poverty programs and from a deep-rooted fear of anything that might lower property values.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For at least the last half century, there has been strong resistance by virtually every community on Long Island whenever the idea of building affordable housing has come up,'' Dr. Koppelman said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the concerns are legitimate ones like school crowding, traffic, taxes and community character, he said, but racism sometimes underlies them. ''If you talk especially about building rental housing, you'll never hear anyone express direct racist attitudes, but 'those people' has become a euphemism for not wanting changes in the ethnicity of a community,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an effort to avoid that stigma, advocates of new initiatives often use terms like ''work-force housing'' or ''next generation housing'' to emphasize how far the need has spread beyond the poor.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's affecting everyone now -- it's my son, your daughter, his elderly mother,'' said Diana Weir, the vice president of the Long Island Housing Partnership, a nonprofit coalition of builders, employers, financial institutions and civic groups that promotes low-cost housing. ''Grumman can't find engineers at $65,000 a year because their employees can't afford a place to live. It used to be just them, those poor people. Now it's all of us. And it's getting ugly.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's common to hear teachers, police officers and nurses cited as the people who need work-force housing, and recent graduates and recent retirees as the people who could remain on the Island if ''next generation housing'' were available.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the work-force banner, the commission set up by Steve Levy, Suffolk's county executive, is pushing forward a plan to build up to 1,000 apartments on county-owned land in Yaphank over the next few years, some of them rental units and some owner-occupied. ''It's a long process, but you have to crawl before you can walk,'' Mr. Levy said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, the biggest obstacle to the Yaphank plan has been community opposition to any increased burden on local schools. Mr. Levy said the county had begun a major educational program to persuade residents that one- and two-bedroom units would bring fewer children into the school district, but would pay more in property taxes, than single-family houses on the same land would.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're starting to see the Nimbyism diminish,'' Mr. Levy said, ''because I think people are realizing this wouldn't bring in people from outside the county but would be for their own grown children who are still living at home.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter Elkowitz, the president of the Long Island Housing Partnership, said that community opposition was just one of a legion of obstacles that could halt a housing project.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three years ago, his group and the Town of Islip completed South Wind Village in Bay Shore, a development of 78 attached homes -- 52 owner-occupied, 16 rented to the elderly and 10 rented to families. It took seven years to complete, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The town had to buy or condemn 30 existing houses, many with tenants who had to be resettled. Seven sources of financing were assembled. The land had to be rezoned to allow greater density -- almost unavoidable if prices are to be held down -- and then cleared and regraded. While all that was going on, construction costs were rising 18 percent a year, Mr. Elkowitz said, so more money had to be found.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prospective buyers and tenants had to be screened; many needed help to clean up their credit and get mortgages. In the end, the project cost $167,000 a unit to build, but the average buyer could afford only $83,000, and rents were capped at 30 percent of income; the shortfalls had to be made up with subsidies.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, South Wind Village made it to completion, and it is now being used as a model for a similar project in the Village of Patchogue. ''What we've learned over the years is that there is no longer one simple solution,'' Mr. Elkowitz said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Suffolk commission is experimenting as well -- for example, by allowing more two-family homes. Mr. Levy noted that the rental income from accessory apartments can help buyers qualify for mortgages. The Town of Southampton has something similar in mind with its zoning proposals.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the median sale price of houses in Southampton hit $516,000 last year, compared with a median household income of $60,219. ''If you don't already own a house and you're looking for one,'' said Mr. White, the town housing director, ''you may be out of luck for the time being.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE median sales price of a single family house in Westchester remained flat in the first three months of 2005, the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service reported last week. After reaching an all-time high of $686,000 in the third quarter of 2004, the median was $615,000 for the quarter that ended in March, the same as it was for the previous quarter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the quarterly median price was up from a year earlier, the rate of increase was smaller than the rises experienced throughout 2004. What that portends for the future is not clear, said P. Gilbert Mercurio, the executive vice president of the Listing Service. It could represent a pause before prices begin to rise again. Or it could indicate that Westchester's seemingly unstoppable housing market has cooled off.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the very least, the housing market ''may be starting to bend from its own weight,'' Mr. Mercurio speculated in the M.L.S.'s first-quarter report. ''Middle-range prices of $615,000 or higher may have begun to outrun the incomes of buyers, even after the deployment of equity in their current residence, and it may be time for prices to pause while incomes catch up.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first-quarter median sale price of a single-family house was up by $45,000, or 8 percent, from the prior year. In 2004, the year-to-year quarterly increases ranged from 13 percent to 16 percent. Home prices tend to follow a statistical pattern throughout the year, Mr. Mercurio said, with prices highest in the second and third quarter reports.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, the deceleration means that sellers can no longer push prices on their homes and expect to sell them quickly, brokers said. ''An 8 percent increase is still healthy, but it's not 15 percent, and sellers can't be as aggressive as before,'' said Ted Holmes, the manager of Prudential Holmes &amp; Kennedy's Armonk office.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales figures compiled each quarter are based on closings; first-quarter closings tend to reflect sales agreements made late in 2004 and in early January of 2005, when the region's economy, as measured by job growth and unemployment rates, was stable and slowly expanding. In November and December, the Federal Reserve Board twice increased its discount rate by a quarter point, but those increases were not reflected in long-term mortgage rates.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, during the first quarter the American economy slowed to its weakest pace in two years, the Commerce Department reported. The nation's gross domestic product, the broadest measure of goods and services produced in the United States, grew 3.1 percent, a somewhat slower pace than had been expected.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slowdown in the Westchester residential real estate market appears to have affected all price categories and did not signal stress in the high-end segment, as some analysts had speculated. ''To the contrary,'' the report said, ''the high-end market maintained its share of sales volume. Properties selling for $1 million or more accounted for 18 percent of first quarter sales in 2005 and 16 percent in 2004; the comparable figures for properties selling in the range of $750,000 to $999,000 were 18 percent and 16 percent respectively as well. The two-percentage-point difference represented ordinary inflationary bracket creep.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices rose more sharply in housing sectors other than single-family homes. The median price of a condominium rose by 13.3 percent in the first quarter of this year to $354,000, from $312,450 a year ago. Co-op prices were up by 16.6 percent, to $158,000 from $135,500. The strongest category of all was multifamily homes -- housing two to five families -- where the median sales price rose 24.1 percent to $540,000 from $435,000 for the first quarter of 2004.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase in multifamily home prices reflected investor interest in such properties in urban areas like White Plains, Yonkers and Mount Vernon, said Chris Meyers, the chief operating officer of Houlihan/Lawrence, which has 29 offices in the county. ''With interest rates so low, investors are still able to maintain a cash flow even if rents are not as high as they once were,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The condo and co-op segments fared well because, in a market of ever-escalating prices, they have provided lower-cost alternatives, said George Kiaffas, an associate broker at Julia B. Fee in Scarsdale. ''They have provided first-time home buyers with an option,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While younger buyers tend to buy less expensive condos and co-ops, empty-nesters shedding a large home are often drawn to luxury units, said Nick Wolff, the owner of Century 21 Wolff, which has four offices in Westchester.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking at the market as a whole, Mr. Meyers at Houlihan/Lawrence suggested that home sellers may not be calling the market tune as much as they had in the recent past. ''It's been such a strong sellers' market for so many years,'' Mr. Meyers said, ''but that was very difficult on buyers, who tended to chase after things. Now they're not jumping anymore.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Advising sellers now to price houses realistically, Mr. Meyers said: ''The idea is to draw multiple bids, and ultimately, that's what will bring the best price. If you price a property ahead of comparable houses, you may end up having to mark it down over time, and property that has markdowns creates a feeling of 'Let's wait and see,' among buyers. Sellers don't want to find themselves in that position.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ellen Grollman of Prudential Holmes &amp; Kennedy cited a colonial in Pleasantville for which she was the listing agent as an example of a property whose owners used an effective strategy. The five-bedroom, three-and-a-half bath house on almost an acre of land went on the market on Feb. 28 for $1.245 million, which was regarded as a not overly aggressive price. The owners received multiple bids and went to contract seven days later for more than the asking price.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all, there were 1,998 closings in Westchester in the first quarter, 1 percent more than for the corresponding period in 2004. Dollar volume for all categories of sales was up 15.6 percent, to $1.173 billion.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory of homes on the market on March 31, 4,765, was 19 percent more than a year earlier and the highest since the end of the first quarter of 1999. But, the M.L.S. report said, the number was low compared with the levels of 8,000 to 10,000 units in the early to mid-1990's and was ''far below the quantities needed to relieve the demand-supply imbalance in our region.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only time will show whether the single-digit increase in the median sales price of a single-family home for the first quarter represented a short-term slowdown or a longer-term market slowing. Mr. Kiaffas at Julia B. Fee believes it is the former. ''We're already seeing things pick up again,'' he said. ''The figures from the Multiple Listing Service reflect just a temporary pause. You'll see that in the next report.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mercurio agreed that the 8 percent first quarter price increase may be just a statistical aberration. But he said, ''no matter how the market develops, it should be recalled that ordinary single-digit percentage price increases were not very long ago considered normal and healthy in this area.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MICHELLE SCHLEIDER has been searching for an apartment to buy on the Upper West Side of Manhattan since January, but she has had no success. Qualifying for a mortgage isn't the problem. It's the down payment.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have a decent salary but I don't have tons of money in the bank,'' said Ms. Schleider, who is 36 and works as a lawyer for American Express. She had been approved for a mortgage that would have allowed her to buy a one-bedroom apartment but because of the high requirements for down payments, typically 20 percent for co-ops and 10 percent for condos, she will have to scale back and look for a studio. Those range in price from $300,000 to $400,000. In other parts of the country, where buyers put down as little as 5 percent, she wouldn't have a problem.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Schleider has no obvious place to turn to come up with the money. ''I don't have parents that I can use as guarantors or for gift money,'' she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York City, the barriers to owning an apartment are high, even for young professionals who earn more than $100,000 a year. The first of these barriers is the down payment. And with high rents it can be challenging even for well paid New Yorkers to save the $50,000 to $150,000 down payment that even modest apartments may require.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But buying with limited savings is not impossible. Throughout Manhattan and Brooklyn there are a smattering of buildings that buck the high down payment rule. Mortgage programs designed to provide buyers in certain neighborhoods with 100 percent financing are available. And by purchasing buildings rather than apartments, buyers can avoid down payment restrictions.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Adrienne Smith began hunting for an apartment last fall, she knew that a co-op with the standard 20 percent down payment was out of the question. As a media consultant, she has a good income, but she lacked significant savings.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's crazy, it really is,'' said Ms. Smith, who is 29. ''I have the salary to sustain the mortgage payments, but it can take 15 years to save the down payment.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ms. Smith beat the odds. While searching online, she found a two-bedroom condo on 106th Street near Columbus Avenue that allowed 95 percent financing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately, there is no comprehensive listing of low down payment buildings. Buyers tend to find them by searching Web sites and hoping for the best. Real estate agents only see such apartments on occasion. And when they do go on the market, they often bring premium prices because they are in such high demand, according to Carlos Saavedra, a broker with the Corcoran Group who brought together Ms. Smith and the apartment's seller.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are other options for people with lower incomes. The New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development helps tenants set up low-income co-ops in buildings that the city has taken possession of in lieu of taxes. These buildings organize their own co-op boards and set their own income guidelines.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of them, like the one at 302 Convent Avenue in Manhattan, allow 100 percent financing, but have income caps; 302 Convent Avenue will only accept a buyer who earns less than $50,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York City also has down payment assistance programs like the HomeFirst Down Payment Assistance program available through the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development. This program provides up to 6 percent of the home's price in a forgivable loan for those who meet a range of criteria, including an income cap of $50,250 for a family of four.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are a number of loans, some through the Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, and others available through commercial banks, that can help first time home buyers purchase a building with no money down.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Barbara Smith, a 32-year-old lawyer, began her house hunt, she did not have a 20 percent down payment sitting neatly in the bank. Far from it. Her real estate broker recommended that she speak with David Adler, a vice president with Greenlight Funding and Mortgage Corporation, who works with multiple lenders. When she heard about his 100 percent financing loans, she was suspicious. ''I wondered, 'what is the catch?''' she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The catch is that this loan requires buyers to purchase a multitenant building within certain low-income neighborhoods below a certain price (Ms. Smith's loan capped her purchase price at $425,000).  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Smith, a corporate lawyer, said that she originally wanted to buy in Harlem but found herself priced out of the neighborhood. She had to expand her search and wound up looking in Brooklyn's Bedford Stuyvesant neighborhood. Ms. Smith put $5,000 down and seven months ago bought a three-story brownstone. She has one tenant on the third floor.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, April 25 -- Sales of existing homes in the United States rose 1 percent in March to the third-highest level on record as an increase in single-family sales offset a drop in sales of condominiums, a trade group said Monday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.89 million units last month, the National Association of Realtors said. That figure includes both single-family homes and condominiums.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of single-family homes increased 1.2 percent in March, to a rate of 6.04 million units, from a rate of 5.97 million in February. Condo sales fell 0.1 percent, to a rate of 845,000 units, from an 846,000 rate in February. Analysts had expected overall sales to climb to a rate of 6.80 million units.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national median home price jumped 11.4 percent, to $195,000, from the same month a year ago, the report showed. That price increase was the biggest since December 1980, when prices rose 11.5 percent, the report said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The market is very strong,'' said David A. Lereah, chief economist for the association group. ''The problem in this country is housing supply. It's still very lean.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, the supply of homes for sale at the current pace was 4 months' worth, down from 4.2 months' worth in February.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We still have this awkward balance between demand and supply,'' Mr. Lereah said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales have been helped by low mortgage rates for more than a year, but some analysts say the housing sector has begun to show signs of easing. Last week, a Commerce Department report showed a 17.6 percent plunge in housing starts for March.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national average long-term fixed mortgage rate was 5.93 percent in March, up from 5.63 percent the month before, according to Freddie Mac.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To the Editor:   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If prices for market-rate apartments are rising, then that means there is a strong demand for housing. If you limit the amount of housing that can be created, you create windfall profits for the developers, who now own a scarce item, and high costs for those who need the housing.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you don't let new buildings rise to meet the demand, you are guaranteeing a housing shortage and thus unaffordable housing to most.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By forcing the developer to price certain units below market, you force the price of the other units higher. Those policies have destroyed the New York housing market in general, and I can't imagine that you would want to see that practice continued.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. In May 2004, I found a condo apartment I really liked. The price was right, and I got a mortgage. When I went before the board, though, I was told that because I had 100 percent financing, I had to come up with two years' worth of common charges -- about $6,000. There is nothing in the condo bylaws about this. Can the condominium board do this without giving some kind of notice? ... Marvin Corp, Howard Beach, Queens.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Allen H. Brill, a Manhattan co-op and condominium lawyer, said that without a provision in the bylaws or the condominium declaration, condominiums in New York generally do not have a right to require board approval for a sale.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''And the condominium board cannot legally condition a sale on the purchaser's agreeing to put up a deposit against future common charges,'' Mr. Brill said, adding that in most cases, the only way a condominium can affect a pending sale is to exercise its right of first refusal and buy the unit in the name of the condominium association.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, he said, exercising the right of first refusal typically requires the approval of at least a majority of the unit owners and, in some cases, even more. Accordingly, Mr. Brill said, unless there is language in the governing documents permitting the board to require a deposit, the letter writer can demand repayment of his $6,000. ''If the board refuses, he can commence a lawsuit in state court to recover the money,'' Mr. Brill said.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By ELSA BRENNER  </div><div>1678 words</div><div>24 April 2005</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2005 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ONCE a commercial hub of Rockland County, the 2.2-square-mile riverfront village of Haverstraw is now a working-class community struggling to emerge from a long slump. But drawn by its unspoiled shoreline along the western bank of the Hudson, housing prices below the median for the area and revitalization efforts in the struggling business district, investors large and small have been placing bets on the long-term attractions of the village 30 miles north of Manhattan.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Martin Ginsburg, one of the largest residential developers in Westchester County, is building the first 134 condominiums in what is to be the 850-unit Harbors at Haverstraw, a project that is to take 10 years to complete. As indicators of what he anticipates as Haverstraw's rosy future, he cites pressure for new housing at work along both sides of the Hudson and the 20-minute commuter ferry service between Haverstraw and the Metro-North Railroad station in Ossining that began in 2000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Jerry Rodriguez, a retired firefighter, has a more limited focus, he and two other investors are also bullish on Haverstraw's future and have invested some of their life savings in the local housing stock. They bought a run-down two-story residential building and plan to convert it to a bed and breakfast inn.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Francis Wassmer, the village's mayor, is orchestrating the renewal of the community's depressed downtown, sprucing up storefronts in an attempt to lure businesses to his once-vibrant hometown.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the three men cite the comebacks of other Hudson River communities like Nyack as reasons for their optimism, not everyone monitoring the real estate scene is so certain that the village is about to undergo a metamorphosis. Those tempering the optimistic predictions cite the village's limited stock of fine old architecture and the plethora of modest single- and multifamily homes that crowd the side streets, as well as the lack of on-street parking.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Haverstraw doesn't have the abundance of grand old houses that some of those other places have,'' said Carmen Di Biase, an agent with Re/Max Cornerstone Realty in nearby Pomona.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot depends on who cuts the diamond in Haverstraw, and how well,'' she said in response to those who refer to the community as a gem in the rough. ''Revitalization takes an expert hand.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days along New Main Street, cultures collide as new entrepreneurs like Francisco Batista take over once-empty storefronts and wish that the residents who live above the stores and in ground-level apartments would be less visible on the sidewalks. ''Sometimes when new people come into the village to check it out, they're afraid to park the car,'' said Mr. Batista, who is a special-education teacher at the local elementary school and is also Haverstraw's deputy mayor. ''A lot of people on the street all day long doesn't help business.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Batista, who moved to Haverstraw 15 years ago from the Dominican Republic, and his wife, Esther, who is from Puerto Rico, recently opened Chadia's Home Furnishings. While he wants to see his business flourish along New Main, he is also worried that gentrification will force out some of his fellow Latinos, especially the poorer ones and some of the newer undocumented immigrants, who may no longer be able to afford to live there.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of Haverstraw's 11,000 residents live below the poverty line. At the Gerald F. Neary Elementary School, which runs through the second grade, administrators reported that 88 percent of the students get federally subsidized lunches. The community has been a haven for several decades for immigrants. It is estimated that the population of the village is 85 percent Latino.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Revitalization,'' Mr. Batista said, ''is a matter of striking a balance.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mayor Wassmer said that $3.7 million in federal funds has been earmarked for renovating building facades in the business district, acquiring property for parking lots, construction of a community center and other improvements. Another $875,000 grant is to pay for new sidewalks and street improvements along Main and New Main Streets.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The effort also involves moving all ground-floor apartments up to the levels above the stores, with some of the upgraded units offered at below-market rents, although that number is yet to be determined. Mr. Wass-mer estimated that about 160 below-market-rate housing units would be built in the village in the coming years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Projects along the waterfront so far have cost about $7 million in local, state and federal funds, the mayor said, and have included a new ferry pier and dock and parking.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The village of Haverstraw is the largest municipality within the 22.7-square-mile Town of Haverstraw, which also includes the village of West Haverstraw, part of the village of Pomona and the hamlets of Thiells and Garnerville.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its early days, from the beginning of the 1800's to the Great Depression in the 1930's, Haverstraw and the area around it was a center for brickmakers, with some 40 brickyards lining the shoreline by the late 1800's. Much of New York City at that time was built from Haverstraw brick.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wassmer, who is known as Bud, is a Republican serving his third four-year term as mayor. He grew up in Haverstraw after World War II, when the village center was the hub of Rockland County. ''There were 100 stores -- candy stores, clothing shops -- and you could walk to everything,'' he recalled. The advent of area malls drew customers away from the bustling downtown, local jobs dried up and ''by the 1990's, we were in a serious tailspin,'' he said. ''It's time to reverse that.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Mr. Ginsburg's condos are rising along the waterfront, with prices for the town houses under construction beginning in the mid-$500,000's and reaching near $1 million for some prime waterfront units.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly betting on the metamorphosis of Haverstraw, Mr. Rodriguez and his partners have spent $550,000 for their pre-Civil War multifamily residence on a side street near the river. They plan to spend about $60,000 to renovate it, completing much of the work themselves. ''We decided to move on this now and not wait to see if the village takes off, because we're afraid that if we waited even a year, we might not find anything for under $700,000,'' Mr. Rodriguez said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Judging by the 19 percent increase in the median sales price for a single-family home in Haverstraw during the past year, Mr. Rodriguez's assessment may be correct. The median was $332,500 for the first quarter of 2005, compared with $279,500 for the period a year ago, according to Nancy Lombardo, a manager for Prudential Rand Realty, which recently opened an office in the village in response to the new development.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The still-low prices in the village in comparison with the rest of Rockland County -- which had a median sales price for single-family houses of $475,000 at the end of the first quarter -- are enticing potential homeowners like Christine Vosler. A single mother of three children, she is living in Morris County in New Jersey but wants to move closer to family in New York. She had hoped to buy a house in Westchester, where she grew up, but said she was priced out of the market in the county, where the latest median sales price of a single-family home was $615,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After ruling out communities east of the Hudson, Ms. Vosler started looking in Nyack, where the median price for a single family home is $431,250. She is now searching for a Victorian-style, four-bedroom home that would cost less in Haverstraw; her ex-husband, George Meireles, who shares custody of the children -- Melissa, 11; Matthew, 9; and Christopher, 4 -- is considering buying a condo at Harbors at Haverstraw.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to the relative affordability of real estate in Haverstraw, Ms. Vosler said she is drawn by the diversity of the student body in the North Rockland Central School District. ''It's a lot more reflective of the real world than many Westchester communities are,'' she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fifty percent of the students in the district, which includes Stony Point, Garnerville, Thiells and West Haverstraw, are white, 35 percent are Latino, 12 percent are African-American, and 3 percent are considered ''other,'' Brian Monahan, deputy superintendent of schools, reported.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At North Rockland High School last year, the average score on the verbal section of the SAT exams was 497; the average for the math section was 504, said Dennis P. Hand, the school's principal. The statewide average last year was 496 for verbal and 510 for math. Mr. Hand reported that of the graduates, 93 percent go on to two- and four-year colleges.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking ahead, some residents express concern about whether the village will lose the diversity that many consider so valuable if Haverstraw evolves into a more upscale community. ''My worry is income gentrification,'' said Ricky Sanchez, a former trustee. ''Revitalization may be good for the village, but unfortunately people will suffer. But maybe that's the price you have to pay.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN the ever-contentious struggle between developers and those who fear a day when Long Island will be completely paved over, score one for the conservationists, at least for the time being.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the rest of the nation enjoyed a housing boom, Long Island -- especially Suffolk County -- suffered a building slump. The number of housing starts dropped by 29 percent from 2000 through 2004, according to building-permit data provided by the Long Island Builders Institute, a trade group for home builders.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of housing starts in Nassau and Suffolk Counties was 6,438 in 2000, dropped 35 percent to 4,182 in 2003 and climbed back up to 4,602 in 2004. Most of the decline came in Suffolk, where most of the Island's undeveloped land remains and where several towns instituted building moratoriums to allow officials time to evaluate land-use policies and consider ways to control development. Many of the moratoriums had been lifted by the end of 2003.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long Island's reduction in new housing occurred while ''home sales and single-family home starts were soaring to all-time highs in the country,'' said Dave Seiders, the chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders in Washington. Total housing starts in the nation grew 24 percent, to 1.95 million in 2004 from 1.57 million in 2000. ''Long Island's moratoriums were fighting the tide,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders and planners say that because Long Island's building slowdown was artificially created and was not caused by a lack of demand, the number of housing starts will most likely bounce back, as the remaining moratoriums run out and as long as interest rates stay low.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But builders and planners say the pace of home building may never reach the high of 2000 or match the rest of the nation again, because local governments have instituted zoning changes and set aside millions in tax dollars to help preserve the Island's remaining open space.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're coming out of the artificial slump,'' said Robert Wieboldt, the executive vice president of the Long Island Builders Institute. ''But the total number has been hurt by the enactments made during the moratoriums.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But conservationists say they fear that the moratoriums did little more than delay development and that government efforts to limit growth will ultimately not be enough.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The moratoria were desperately-needed timeouts so that local government could wrestle the overdevelopment problem under control,'' said Richard Amper, the executive director of the Long Island Pine Barrens Society. ''But developers don't have to worry about going out of business because development is still outpacing preservation, and they've been waiting on the sidelines the whole time, planning their plays when the moratoria run out.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years several municipalities have upzoned, or enlarged the size of a lot for an individual house from a half acre or one acre to two acres or more. As a result, Mr. Wieboldt predicted that housing starts on Long Island would eventually level off at about 5,000 a year. ''Which is just a drop in the bucket,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also said that because ''government with deep pockets'' has been competing to buy land to preserve it as open space, land values in general had gone up, contributing to the seemingly ceaseless run-up in home prices. He singled out the sale of development rights to the Detmer Farm in Setauket, which Suffolk County first sought to buy for $2 million in 2002, ultimately paying $5.8 million for it last year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conservationists counter that developers seeking to build mini-mansions on expansive plots are the ones driving up land prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local officials, meanwhile, say that as many residents have come to view suburban sprawl as an evil to be overcome, government has had to grapple with ways to slow down or rethink development.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Jay LaValle, the supervisor of the Town of Brookhaven, which has had a moratorium on multifamily units since July 2003 and has previously had moratoriums pegged to specific parts of the town, said he was skeptical that home building had slowed in his town.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I would find that very hard to believe because they're building houses like crazy,'' he said. ''But even if it is true, less is not necessarily a bad thing. There needs to be a balance. Residents want to preserve a certain quality of life. That's why they moved here.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is also why the town is developing an entirely new zoning code. ''Our residents have told us that we need to be more prudent as we develop and we need to develop more wisely,'' Mr. LaValle said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Southold, town officials rewrote zoning regulations for new subdivisions after a 30-month moratorium that ended last December. The new rules require developers to preserve open space by clustering homes and to reserve a certain percentage of their new homes as affordable housing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joshua Y. Horton, Southold's supervisor, said that the new zoning code was intended to stop sprawl and to encourage the development of existing hamlets as pedestrian friendly.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We shouldn't be planning in a way that entices developers to pave a community over,'' he said. ''We're here to protect the community and to ensure that proper planning takes place, with the understanding that change and growth will happen.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the entrenched positions of the different interests, one apparent point of agreement is the need for affordable housing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The definition of affordable housing tends to vary from place to place. On the East End, the focus is on houses affordable to local residents, not those intended for second-home buyers. Elsewhere on the Island, affordable housing would be geared toward young workers or retirees who cannot afford and may not want the typical suburban single-family home with large yards.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even as government officials have considered ways to encourage affordable housing, building moratoriums may have unintentionally hindered it. Pearl M. Kamer, the chief economist for the Long Island Association, said land prices had soared while the supply of usable land was temporarily reduced by building moratoriums.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As a result, fewer units are built, and they tend to be luxury units because that's the only thing that makes sense economically for builders,'' she said. ''So then it's not just a simple matter of housing starts declining, but one in which the housing stock we're building no longer meets the changing needs of our population.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business leaders took up the affordable-housing cause in the 1980's as they realized the lack of reasonably priced homes made it difficult to attract workers to Long Island. More recently, builders and conservationists have embraced the cause as well.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I never thought I'd see the day,'' Dr. Kamer said. ''But both sides recognize the need, and I think they're willing to compromise for the common good.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some Long Island homeowners may not yet be ready for the concept, because affordable housing means higher-density housing, like two-family homes, attached town houses, condominiums and rental apartments.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Rental housing is still seen as something that might attract the wrong element, when it would really attract our sons and daughters who can't afford to live here right now,'' Dr. Kamer said. ''We need to do a better job of educating the public that affordable housing doesn't mean that Nassau County will become the sixth borough of New York City and that Suffolk will become the seventh borough.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To that end, officials from Nassau and Suffolk have been trying to encourage builders to put up affordable housing in existing downtowns or on previously developed parcels.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've been emphasizing redevelopment because there is a finite amount of land on Long Island,'' said Jim Morgo, Suffolk County's commissioner of economic development and work-force housing. ''But the development community hasn't gone full bore on redevelopment because it obviously is more expensive.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Rabinovitch, the executive director of the Nature Conservancy's Long Island chapter, said that there was a clear need to change the Island's traditional development formula of pushing east once an area has been built up.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The current formula won't work forever because we're constantly just trying to run from behind to catch up,'' he said. ''And eventually we'd end up in the ocean with no open space left.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If a silver bullet exists for Long Island's housing quandary, he said, it will be to build upward in the Island's downtown areas. In many cases zoning regulations will have to be amended to permit taller buildings.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It will take courage for government officials to stand before their communities and say it's time to have four- or six-story buildings in downtown areas,'' Mr. Rabinovitch said. ''But that will refresh our downtowns and also be the release valve that's needed.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Town of Riverhead did just that last year when the town board approved new zoning that increased height limits on buildings in downtown Riverhead to five stories from three. Philip Cardinale, the town supervisor, said that this change and other new zoning were aimed at encouraging downtown's redevelopment and preserving the town's farmland.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have three-mile stretches of just farm fields on both sides of our main roads, and we want to preserve them,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the town changed its minimum lot size for a single-family home to one or two acres and also created a program for transferring development rights from farmland to other areas of the town.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The pot of gold at the end of the rainbow is the saving of our farm belt while increasing development in our commercial and industrial areas,'' Mr. Cardinale said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steve Levy, Suffolk's county executive, said that the need to build more housing and the desire to preserve open space were not necessarily incompatible.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are of the belief that we can simultaneously seek more construction to meet our housing needs while at the same time preserving our more environmentally sensitive properties,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Lee E. Koppelman, the executive director of the Long Island Regional Planning Board, said that because Long Island is after all an island, ''it's not really accurate to say there's enough room to do everything.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building moratoriums and other government programs to rezone land and preserve open space have slowed growth, but not postponed the inevitable. Builders, conservationists and planners agree that within the next 7 to 10 years, Long Island's land-use future will be sealed and that whatever is destined to be developed or preserved as open space will have been determined.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the end, to the extent that open-space preservation succeeds, it means development does not succeed, and vice versa,'' Dr. Koppelman said. ''And that's just something we have to come to terms with.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average price paid for a Manhattan apartment in the first three months of this year was $1.17 million, up 30 percent from the same period in 2004, and 11 percent higher than in the previous three months, according to a market report prepared by Brown Harris Stevens. The median sales price was $695,000, up 27 percent from the quarter a year earlier. Another study, prepared for Prudential Douglas Elliman by Miller Samuel, reported that while sales were brisk, the low inventory of apartments led to a 6 percent quarterly drop in the number of completed sales, to 2,028 units. The average time it took for an apartment to go to contract was 94 days, two days less than in the previous quarter, and it is the first time that number has remained below 100 days for two consecutive quarters, the report said.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, March 23 -- Sales of existing homes fell 0.4 percent in February, while home prices rose at double-digit rates, a trade association reported Wednesday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes declined to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.79 million units last month, the National Association of Realtors said. That figure includes both single-family homes and condominiums.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family home sales slid 0.3 percent in February, to a 5.94 million unit rate, from a 5.96 million unit pace in January. Condominium sales dropped 1.2 percent, to an 848,000 unit rate, from an 858,000 unit pace in January.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts had expected sales to fall to a 6.7 million unit rate, from 6.82 million units in January.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national median home price jumped 11 percent from February 2004, to $191,000, the report showed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Lereah, the group's chief economist, said the housing market appeared to be in the early stages of settling down. ''Home sales were surging at unprecedented levels for most of last year,'' Mr. Lereah said. ''The cooling we expect in sales this year means we'll be transitioning from a white-hot housing market into a very strong market that still favors home sellers, but should become more balanced as the year progresses.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In February, the supply of homes for sale at the current pace was 4.2 months' worth, up from 3.8 months' worth in January.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The report showed a negligible decline,'' said Susan Stearns, vice president for institutional foreign exchange sales at the Bank of Montreal in New York. Housing ''is holding at a pretty steady level here,'' she added.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales have been bolstered by low mortgage rates. According to Freddie Mac, the national average long-term fixed mortgage rate was 5.63 percent in February, down from 5.71 percent in January.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dateline of a front-page article last Tuesday about growing speculation in residential real estate misstated the name of a Florida city where housing prices are rising. It is Sunny Isles Beach, not Sunny Isles.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SUNNY ISLES, Fla., Feb. 25 -- Within six months last year, Carlos and Betti Lidsky bought and sold two condominiums. Then they bought and sold two houses. They say they will clear a half-million dollars in profit, and none of the homes have even been built.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Mr. Lidsky, a lawyer, and his wife, a charity fund-raiser, have put down a deposit on a fifth property, a $1.3 million condo in a high-rise under construction, and are planning to sell before the deal closes, without even taking out a mortgage.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is much better than the stock market,'' Mr. Lidsky said. ''This is an extraordinary, phenomenally good result.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In several metropolitan areas, from Miami to Riverside, Calif., where the real estate market is white hot, rapidly rising prices are luring a growing number of ordinary people into buying and selling residences they do not intend to occupy, despite warnings from some economists that prices cannot continue to rise as steeply as they have in the last few years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to LoanPerformance Inc., a San Francisco mortgage data firm, about 8.5 percent of mortgages nationwide in the first 11 months of last year were taken out by people who did not plan to live in the houses themselves, up from 5.8 percent in 2000. In some markets, that proportion is much higher: in Phoenix, more than 12 percent of mortgages were taken out by investors; in Miami, the figure is 11 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors, a trade organization that represents real estate brokers, said in a study being released on Tuesday that the percentage of homes bought for investment might be as high as one-quarter of the 7.7 million sold last year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Americans are treating real estate as a viable alternative to stocks and bonds,'' said David Lereah, chief economist at the Realtors association. And some are buying at least two properties at a time.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like the day traders of the 1990's dot-com boom, people are investing in a market that seems to just go up. Promoters use Web sites to attract investors, promising quick profits. One site, getpreconstructionprofits.com, is run by a pair of investors who offer online training for $197. On their home page, they say people can earn over $100,000 in six months investing in unbuilt real estate.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists say the influx of investors into the real estate market could have negative consequences.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Investors are now seemingly buying based on the expectation that house prices are going to grow as rapidly as they have in the recent past, long into the future,'' said Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Economy.com, a private research group. ''How quickly and high fixed mortgage rates rise will determine whether the speculative fever in the market just goes flat or whether it caves.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, low interest rates are helping to fuel the frenzy. Sometimes, homeowners borrow equity from their primary residence to finance down payments. These buyers, some of whom lost money when the stock market crashed five years ago, believe real estate is a safer bet.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rita Lawrence, a construction business owner in Phoenix, has bought three houses in the last two years. Ms. Lawrence and her husband rent out two of them, and they hope to sell the third -- which they are buying for $195,000 -- for $249,000, after a quick renovation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taxes can take a sizable part of the profits in these deals. Investors who sell within a year of purchase face federal short-term capital gains taxes of up to 35 percent, and 15 percent if they wait a year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, investors have been seduced by the steady upward march of house prices over the past few years. Since 2000, the national median price of a house has increased by 33 percent. And in the fourth quarter of last year, out of 129 metropolitan areas covered by the Realtors, 62 markets showed double-digit price rises over the same period a year earlier.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for investment properties has risen in markets with the most spectacular price increases, according to brokers. As buyers were priced out of Los Angeles, they moved into San Bernardino and adjacent Riverside County, where prices rose by 35 percent last year. Nancy Overgaag, a mortgage broker at Financial 2000 in Redlands, Calif., said about one-third of her customers were looking to invest in real estate.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in Manhattan, where average sales prices topped $1 million last year, investors are piling into the market, brokers say.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some investment buyers are willing to rent out their properties at a monthly loss, anticipating future sales price rises. Dru Finley and her husband, Hsiao-Li Pan, who live in Brewster, N.Y., bought a one-bedroom condominium in Battery Park City in Lower Manhattan last summer for $499,000. They rent it out for $2,225 a month, about $1,000 less than their mortgage and maintenance costs. The couple hope to make up the shortfall when they sell the condo in a few years. ''It seems that real estate always goes up,'' in the long term, Ms. Finley said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many homeowners are tapping the paper wealth in their own homes to buy more real estate. Mark Purnell, who manages internal technology for a software company in Southern California, said the four-bedroom house he bought eight years ago in Rancho Santa Margarita, south of Los Angeles, had quadrupled in value to $800,000. Last year he took out a $150,000 home equity loan and, with his brother, bought three houses in Phoenix.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Purnell, 36, who is renting out those houses, said he would buy more in Phoenix but could not find anything. So he is turning his attention to Palm Springs, Calif. His Phoenix real estate agent, Kim Martin of Re/Max Achievers, said that investors had helped deplete inventories of available properties from about 25,000 this time last year to about 8,000 now.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a backlash against speculative investing in some popular markets like Phoenix and Las Vegas, some homebuilders now prohibit renting or selling houses for at least a year after closing. As a result, investors have started to back off in Las Vegas, where the pace of the price rises started to ease towards the end of last year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in Miami, the speculative craze is promoted in part by developers and brokers who help buyers to resell quickly.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers in Miami work overtime to get their clients into V.I.P. sales events before developers start pitching buildings to the public.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Lidskys were heading out of town early last year when they got a call from Michelle L. Judd, a sales associate at Ocean IV, a high-rise being built in Sunny Isles by a consortium led by the Related Group of Florida, the same company that built the condo where they have lived since 2003. Ms. Judd was offering to sell them a second unit, but only if they would put down a deposit that day.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shortly before their flight, Mr. Lidsky drove to the sales office and without viewing any floor plans, ended up writing deposit checks totaling $159,380 for a $479,900 two-bedroom condo, and an adjoining four-bedroom unit for $1,113,900. The money came from a bank line of credit not secured by their current home. Within three months, Ms. Judd called again: she had buyers for the two-bedroom willing to pay $625,000 and $1.425 million for the four-bedroom.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such get-rich-quick stories have increased demand for preconstruction condo units in and around Miami. While many buyers do intend to move in to their homes, as many as half the original buyers of some condos resell them before they are built. Of the 280 units at Ocean IV, Ms. Judd said, nearly 130 had resold.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thomas Daly, a principal investor with the Related Group in 18 condo projects, said the company did not ''encourage investors'' but that once a project was initially sold out, the developer would help buyers resell their properties quickly ''to accommodate our purchasers.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers of some projects do not allow buyers to resell before closing, because they fear this could artificially inflate prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of those projects, Arte City, a 202-unit condo complex being built in Miami Beach, is still attracting investors, although they are those who are willing to wait longer to sell. Jaime Nack, a 29-year-old event producer in Santa Monica, Calif., bought a one-bedroom unit at Arte City for $270,000, financing the down payment with a second mortgage on her one-bedroom condo in Santa Monica.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Nack plans to rent out the unit for a couple of years before selling. Because of its proximity to the beach, ''I think it will be safe even if the market drops a bit,'' she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some real estate watchers in Miami wonder whether that drop will come soon. With more than 60,000 units in some phase of development in the Miami area, ''the supply may be greater than the ultimate demand,'' said Michael Y. Cannon, managing director of Integra Realty Resources-South Florida, a market analyst. A similar situation in 1986 sent the market spiraling, and it took seven years to recover.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, investors like the Lidskys are still buying. They intend to buy at least one more unit -- their sixth in less than a year -- in another condo. But the couple, who acknowledged being ''killed'' in the stock market five years ago, sounded a note of caution.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Maybe we won't lose money, but I just think it is not going to keep up,'' Ms. Lidsky said . ''At some point there are just going to be too many apartments in this area.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Harlem real estate renaissance rolls on -- and the numbers show it.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of condominiums and co-ops above West 116th Street and East 96th Street reached 5.5 percent of all sales in Manhattan last year, according to the Prudential Douglas Elliman Manhattan Market Report, compared with the 3.6 percent share it held in 2003.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By comparison, the downtown loft market was 9.4 percent of all sales in Manhattan, up from 8.1 percent the year before.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They've both gone up,'' said Jonathan Miller, president of the Miller Samuel appraisal company, which prepared the Elliman report, ''but the market that's gotten most of the attention, and was discovered first, was the loft market, which really came into being in the 90's. Now Harlem has become a significant segment that can't be overlooked.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is impossible for Willie Katherine Suggs, president of the Harlem brokerage firm that bears her name, to overlook the change. ''There are blocks in Harlem that bear no resemblance to what they looked like 10 years ago,'' Ms. Suggs said. ''Right outside my door, it was like somebody bombed it out -- vacant lots, vacant buildings. Now there are two nine-story luxury buildings, and they are doing a third one on the north side of 145th Street.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seen over a 10-year period, Harlem's renewal is even more evident. The Elliman report tracked 8,653 co-op and condo sales for all of Manhattan last year, up 77.9 percent from 4,865 sales in 1995, when the real estate market bottomed out after the 1990-91 recession. In Harlem last year, the report said, there were 473 co-op and condo sales, a 164 percent jump from 179 sales in 1995. The report is based on closed transactions for all brokerage firms in Manhattan.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There has been, not surprisingly, a corresponding surge in prices. The average sales price for all of Manhattan in 2004 was $1,004,232, up 18.1 percent from $850,340 in 2003, and up 140.5 percent since 1995, the report said. In Harlem, the average price in 2004 was $358,657, up 36.9 percent from $261,951 in 2003, and up 333.7 percent from $82,693 in 1995.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price in Manhattan last year was $605,859, up 22.4 percent from $495,000 in 2003, and up 192 percent from $207,500 in 1995. In Harlem, the median price in 2004 was $305,490, rising by 32.8 percent over the median of $230,000 in 2003, and bounding up by 350 percent from $68,000 in 1995.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Suggs credits city housing policy for the boom. ''You have city money involved,'' she said. ''If you agreed to keep prices affordable, you got tax breaks and all kinds of incentives. And investors took advantage of them. Where else could you get a two-bedroom apartment for $190,000?''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, most of those subsidized, renovated apartments are gone, ''and nonsubsidized apartments start at $450,000 and go up to over a million,'' Ms. Suggs continued. ''It became the self-fulfilling prophecy.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spurring the demand, of course, is the fact that Manhattan ''has just gotten so expensive,'' said Dr. Chris Mayer, director of the Milstein Center for Real Estate at Columbia University. ''And, certainly, the renaissance in Harlem, in Brooklyn and, frankly, across the bridges and tunnels to New Jersey, shows that close access to Midtown is worth the price.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, at the same time, Harlem's character has changed a lot in just a decade. ''Large chain grocery stores are there; hotels opening up, the Body Shop, Starbucks,'' Dr. Mayer said. ''And it has become harder for people on a limited income to live there.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's always an interesting question whether so-called gentrification is good or bad,'' he added.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AS housing prices keep rising year after year, real estate has become a national obsession -- and a more powerful economic engine. Sales of homes and condominiums totaled an estimated $2.17 trillion in 2004, said Lawrence Yun, senior economist at the National Association of Realtors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The industry couldn't function without the armies of agents who help buyers and sellers reach mutually agreeable terms on those four-bedroom, center-hall colonials, and who generally collect hefty 6 percent commissions for their trouble. But a recent study by two University of Chicago economists suggests that home sellers should regard agents with some caution. The study does not suggest that agents are inherently untrustworthy. Rather, it says, the housing market remains inefficient, and the incentives for agents to maximize profits for their clients aren't powerful enough.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study was instigated by Steven D. Levitt, a self-described ''rogue economist'' who has applied the analytical tools of his trade to everything from sumo wrestlers to drug-dealing gangs; his work is cataloged in the forthcoming book ''Freakonomics,'' written with Stephen J. Dubner.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Professor Levitt had fixed up and sold several houses in Oak Park, Ill., a suburb of Chicago. When working with real estate agents, he said, ''I got the impression they weren't working solely in their clients' best interest.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with a colleague, Chad Syverson, Professor Levitt set out to prove it by comparing data on homes that agents sold on behalf of others with those that they owned and sold for themselves. They analyzed sales from 1992 to 2002 of 98,000 homes in suburban Chicago, of which 3,300 were owned by real estate agents. When the economists constructed an analysis that controlled for amenities, location and the adjectives used to describe the houses, they found that agent-owned homes, on average, stayed on the market 9.5 days longer and commanded median prices that were 3.7 percent higher than comparable homes owned by clients.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, agents may just know how to position homes for sale better than other people do. It's their job, after all. And, being human, they may work harder selling their own homes, the way a dentist may take extra care cleaning her own child's teeth. But these explanations don't square with the data. ''If that were the case, you'd expect the clients' homes to stay on the market longer than the brokers' homes,'' Professor Levitt said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two professors conclude that poorly designed incentives bear some of the blame. ''You have to keep in mind that the agent's incentives don't line up perfectly with your own,'' Professor Syverson said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate agents have a better sense than others of the best price a home can command. But when they work for others, they don't have the financial incentive to pursue it. Most home sales generate a 6 percent commission, split between the brokerage firms representing the buyer and seller. The agent generally receives half of the firm's draw, or 1.5 percent of the sale. So if a home sells for $500,000, the agent personally receives $7,500. Not bad for what may be just a few days of work. If the agent works for an additional week and urges the seller to hold out for $515,000, that's an extra $15,000 for the seller, but only an extra $225 for the agent. Because every additional dollar throws only a penny and a half into the pocket of the agent, the economists reason, the agent may push clients to accept lowball offers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, price is just one factor motivating sellers to accept offers. Many are in a hurry, maybe because they are relocating for new jobs, or want to be in their new city by the time the next school year starts. So they may feel compelled to accept the first offer. Most agents who sell their own homes, by contrast, aren't leaving the area. ''The brokers may be in a situation where they can be more patient,'' said Mr. Yun of the National Association of Realtors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Armed with this knowledge, what should home sellers do? ''You cannot completely trust the advice your broker gives you,'' said Christopher J. Mayer, a professor of real estate at Columbia Business School. ''You have to become more educated as a buyer.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, the economists concluded that sellers, empowered by the Internet, are already eroding agents' advantage. Sites like Realtor.com and domania.com allow anyone to survey the market and check out neighborhood price histories. From 1992 to 1995, in the days before such sites existed, agents' homes commanded prices that were 4.9 percent higher and stayed on the market more than 14 days longer than equivalent other homes. But from 2000 to 2002, a period when such sites came into popular use, the margins shrank to 2.9 percent and 2.5 days.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As consumers become more comfortable with the idea that they can price their own properties, times will get tougher and tougher for real estate agents,'' Professor Levitt said.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of homes and multifamily dwellings unexpectedly rose to a 21-year high in January, led by record construction of single-family homes, the Commerce Department reported yesterday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report showed that industrial production was unchanged as warm weather dampened demand for energy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 4.7 percent rise in construction, to 2.159 million housing units at an annual rate, came after a revised 14 percent surge in December that was higher than first reported, the Commerce Department said. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News had expected a decline, to 1.925 million housing units.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of single-family homes rose 2.7 percent, to 1.76 million, the highest ever, from 1.71 million in December. Construction of townhouses, apartments and other multifamily dwellings rose 14 percent, to 399,000 units at an annual rate.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The combined pace for single-family and multifamily starts was the fastest since 2.26 million in February 1984.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits, an indicator of future construction, also rose last month, advancing 1.7 percent to an annual rate of 2.105 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Production at United States factories, mines and utilities was unchanged last month, held back by a decline in energy demand, the Federal Reserve reported yesterday. Economists had expected a 0.3 percent increase.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The share of industrial capacity in use slipped to 79 percent from 79.1 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Automakers, including Ford Motor and General Motors, have said they are cutting back on production in the first quarter to reduce inventories as sales in January have fallen.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chicago announced plans to install a new security system with 900 miles of fiber optic cable, more than 2,200 surveillance cameras, and biochemical and radiological sensors to help detect terrorist attacks. The system, which will be financed by a $53 million settlement between the city and a cable company, is to be installed over 18 months. The cameras and sensors will be able to detect biological agents like anthrax and activity like a truck parking in a suspicious location, said Ron Huberman of the city's emergency management office.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OFFICIAL statistics released last week confirmed what real estate professionals were maintaining all last year: Westchester's housing market is on a roll and shows no signs of coming down off its five-year high anytime soon.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''How about that!'' said Greg Rand, a managing partner for Prudential Rand Realty, after reading a report released by the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service. ''We're still going strong.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The year 2004 was a record setter for the market in several ways, the listing service noted. The number of home sales reached an all-time high of 10,517 closings, up 2 percent from the previous record set in 1999. Also, the median sale price for a single-family home hit a new high at $645,000, up from $564,000 in 2003. And dollar volume of residential sales soared to $6.376 billion, up 24.3 percent from 2003.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''More and more, families are seeing the residential real estate market as the best and safest place for their money,'' said Mr. Rand, whose company has offices throughout the Hudson Valley. ''There's a massive shift of wealth moving from banking and Wall Street to real estate.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the ongoing problem of a lack of houses for sale in Westchester eased somewhat last year. The supply of housing on the market in 2004 was low by long-term historical standards. But it pulled ahead of 2003's inventory by the second quarter of the year, ''reflecting decisions by prospective sellers to list their properties in what they perceived to be an advantageous market for them,'' according to the report.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Westchester's 2004 year-end inventory for all types of homes -- single-family houses, condominiums, co-ops and multifamily structures -- was up by 15 percent, to 3,953 units in 2004 from 3,436 units in 2003. The rise helped the number of sales, but was not great enough to bring prices down. ''The amount of inventory formation,'' the report explained, ''was enough to support the high sales volume but not enough to ease the upward pressure on prices.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while single-family homes accounted for most sales -- 6,157 in 2004, versus 5,601 the year before -- there was a significant uptick in the number of co-ops that sold. Co-op sales increased by 11.5 percent, to 2,203 in 2004 from 1,975 the preceding year; condo sales were up by 2.4 percent, to 1,438 from 1,404 in 2003.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Together, condos and co-ops represented 35 percent of all residential sales last year, compared with 30 percent in 1999. ''Their combined share of sales has steadily increased over the past decade, reflecting their growing proportion of the region's total housing stock as a result of co-op conversions and new condominium construction,'' the report said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the category of two-to-five-family homes, 719 units sold during 2004, up by 33.4 percent from 2003, when 539 units sold.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sale price of a condo reached $339,450 in 2004, up by $34,450 in 2003. For the same period, the median sale price of a co-op was $149,000, up by $22,750 from 2003. The median for a two-to five-family house was $480,000, up by $54,500.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Favorable mortgage rates contributed to the strong results in 2004, according to the listing service, which noted that rates were as low as 6 percent on 30-year conventional mortgages at the beginning of the year, increased to about 6.5 percent in the spring and then fell back to 6 percent and less. ''Neither the prospect nor actual fact of upward adjustments in the Federal Reserve Bank's discount rate seemed to affect long-term mortgage interest rates,'' it said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another factor sustaining high sales volume was the stability of the region's economy, which apparently encouraged buyers to feel safe about buying property. The unemployment rate for Westchester was about 4 percent; job growth, though slight, was still about 1 percent for the year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another major factor was New York City's robust real estate market, which may have encouraged renters and co-op owners in Manhattan to enter Westchester's high-end single-family house market. ''Compared to prices in Manhattan,'' said David Firnhaber, manager of Houlihan/Lawrence's Chappaqua office, ''Westchester looks like a bargain.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prices being paid for single-family homes at the upper end of the Westchester market are striking. Last year, about 21 percent of all single-family home sales were for $1 million or more. Another 18 percent sold for $750,000 to $1 million. By comparison, the percentages in 1999 were just 6 percent in each category.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of 20 houses recently listed in Chappaqua, almost all are priced $1 million or more, Mr. Firnhaber said, with some close to $2 million. He also noted that demand was already robust in 2005, while in most years buyers do not turn out in force until late in winter or early in the spring.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while that may be good news for many people -- including homeowners in the county who have built up equity in properties -- Mr. Firnhaber observed that it was becoming more difficult for middle-income earners to move to many sections of Westchester. ''My colleagues and I are worried,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking forward, the report anticipates more good times for residential sales. ''The pattern of inventory formation of the past 18 months, if it continues into 2005, seems sufficient to support a high rate of sales,'' the report said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also reported that the economy remained strong and that corporate relocations were likely to bring new jobs and yet more demand for housing to Westchester. Even if mortgage interest rates increase somewhat in 2005 -- analysts are forecasting a series of small increases -- ''there will be only a moderate negative effect on our area's real estate market,'' the report concluded.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One note of caution, according to the report and Mr. Firnhaber at Houlihan/Lawrence, involves the impact of such a vigorous market on ''entry-level buyers who are already struggling to afford even the below-median range of the single-family house market.'' Those buyers will increasingly need to look to condominiums and co-ops to meet their homeownership goals, the report said.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ANGELINA UMANSKY, a 39-year-old spa owner from San Francisco, was visiting a friend in Miami two weeks ago when she heard about a new condo development downtown. Hoping to find a vacation home, but worried that others were interested, too, Ms. Umansky arrived at the sales office at 8 a.m. the day after seeing some model units.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 50 other buyers were already in line. Two hours later, a sales agent summoned her and said she had four minutes to decide which unit to buy. She acted fast, offering $350,000 for a two-bedroom, two-bathroom unit.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Umansky thinks she got a bargain; when she called on behalf of a friend less than eight hours later, she was told the asking price on a unit like hers had climbed to $380,000, a nearly 9 percent price increase.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just when it seemed as if the real estate market couldn't get any barmier, it has. With inventories lagging behind demand and prices for new homes rising seemingly by the hour in destination cities like New York and second-home markets like Miami and Orlando, home buyers are camping out overnight in front of sales offices, pestering brokers and developers and scooping up multiple units in the real estate version of scalping.''This is a perfect storm for a frenzied housing market,'' said Susan Wachter, a professor of real estate at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. ''The economy is strengthening, the restrictions on development are increasing and long-term mortgage rates are still historically low.'' Ms. Wachter added that as interest rates start to creep up, more buyers tend to pile into the market, trying to lock in good rates.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the country, according to the National Association of Home Builders, the number of new condos sold jumped 32 percent to an estimated 115,000 in 2004 compared with a year earlier. And in New York the number of condo sales in the three months through December 2004 increased 8.2 percent over the same period a year earlier, and average condo prices were up 11.1 percent to $1.29 million, according to Miller Samuel, a New York real estate appraiser.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gold rush mentality has some economists concerned. Some buyers of new condos and houses are behaving like day-traders before the dot-com crash, said John Vogel Jr., a real estate professor at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some cases, developers are actually creating the frenzy. In central Florida, Transeastern Homes, which builds subdivisions, asks prospective buyers to put down a refundable deposit of $500 to $5,000 to reserve a time slot to buy a house that has yet to be built, sometimes without knowing more than the general location of the subdivision and a price range.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers review floor plans and maps first at a Web site or in a brochure. When they arrive at the sales ''event,'' typically at a hotel or a convention center, they spend five minutes looking at a map and choosing a home before the next buyer moves to the front of the line. Price increases -- up to 16 a day-- are announced over loudspeakers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People get excited and get caught up in it,'' said Joel Lazar, a Transeastern vice president. ''Even if they weren't planning on buying a home, they convince themselves to buy a home.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last Sunday, Jeanette Gomez, a banquet server at a resort hotel, drove her mother, Maria Gomez, to her 11:12 a.m. appointment at a hotel in west Orlando. Although the senior Ms. Gomez wasn't planning to buy, she ended up making an $18,500 down payment on a two-bedroom town house. ''I pushed her,'' her daughter said. ''I said 'Just do it.' I think it's a good buy because the sales agent told us the price already went up $20,000 since yesterday.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's lost in the giddiness is a sense of history. ''People have a belief that's not true: that you can't lose money in real estate,'' said Joseph Gyourko, a real estate professor at Wharton. ''We know from the late 80's and early 90's that you can.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York, for example, median sales prices -- the exact middle of all sales prices -- peaked at $375,000 in 1987 before plunging 45 percent to a low of $205,000 in 1995. Median prices did not climb back up to their 1980's levels again until 2000, according to Miller Samuel. In the Northeast, the National Association of Realtors said median sales prices fell 11 percent from 1988 to 1989, and did not return to 1988 levels until 2001.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That doesn't stop some buyers from making impulsive down payments on condos that don't yet exist. In October, AnneMarie Alexander, then a broker with Prudential Douglas Elliman, took some brochures and parked her BMW 740 in front of a hole in the ground on 17th Street in Chelsea. She proceeded to sell five luxury condos -- at prices above $1 million each -- from the back seat of her car. ''I showed them the site through a hole in the fence,'' Ms. Alexander said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last summer, arguments erupted when 50 prospective buyers spent the night in front of a 16-unit building in Park Slope, Brooklyn, before an open house. As a result, the Corcoran Group, which marketed the property, now sells new condos only by appointment, said Jay Schippers, head of new development for Corcoran in Brooklyn.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now buyers and their brokers are quarreling over viewing dates. Security guards at 56 Pine Street, a 90-unit condo in Manhattan, called the police to escort two brokers out of a sales office last month. ''They said they were not leaving until they got an appointment,'' said Andy Gerringer, a managing director of Prudential Douglas Elliman, which is helping to sell the condos.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If all else fails, some buyers try bribery. When 3,600 people showed up for a party showcasing a 419-unit condo project in Arlington, Va., last September, the developers booked appointments through the end of January. Afterward, those who had missed out were ''offering us lunch and tickets to baseball games,'' said David Klimas, a broker with McWilliams/Ballard, which was marketing the development. (Mr. Klimas said the buyers' tactics did not work.)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hoping to beat out the crowds vying last fall for apartments in the Toy Factory Lofts, a new condominium in downtown Brooklyn, Jason Lynn showed up at 11 p.m. -- 14 hours before the sales office opened. He was carrying a fold-up chair, his iPod, some tennis balls (for pick-up handball) and a book. Before long there were enough other early birds to start a card game.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lynn says he was happy to stay up all night. He landed a 700-square-foot loft for $314,000 -- 15 percent more than he would have paid at an open house two days earlier.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is always a frenzy at the beginning of a development because the prices are lower,'' said David Behin, an executive vice president at the Developers Group, which handled sales at the Toy Factory.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some excited buyers aim to get a jump on property before it is advertised. Kenneth Horn, president of Alchemy Properties, which is developing a 67-unit condo on 19th Street in Chelsea, said he already has more than 200 individuals and more than 300 brokers on a waiting list for the development, which has yet to receive approval from the attorney general's office, which regulates new real estate.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers field calls from people poised to sign a contract the minute one is available. Some check in three times a day, said Michael Klein, an agent with Liberty Realty in Hoboken, N.J. A couple of times last year, he said, he called clients at 11 p.m. to share floor plans fresh from the printer. The buyers signed deals the same night.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hoping to manage the crush, the developers of Maxwell Place, a luxury condominium project in a renovated coffee plant on the Hoboken waterfront, told interested buyers in November that they would need appointments, available only to 77 people and only by calling an 800 number at exactly 1 p.m. on a Tuesday. Within an hour, all 77 appointments were taken.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Vogel, the real estate professor, said the sales hysteria has troubling parallels. ''We've now moved past the stage of people saying we've got to get in before it's too late,'' said Mr. Vogel. ''Now we're at the speculator stage.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, Harold Gallo, director for marketing of the Related Group, a developer in Miami with a 1,000-unit condo that sold out in 36 hours last spring, said that about 50 percent of the buyers were investors -- in other words, people who will never live in the apartments and often sell them before anyone moves in. Mr. Vogel said that the frantic buying was characteristic of the tech bubble before it collapsed, adding, ''It speeded up.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest threat to the housing boom is a sharp increase in mortgage rates. ''That will quickly knock the wind out of these housing markets and the psychology will reverse as quickly as it appeared,'' said Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Economy.com, a private research group. For now, interest rates are expected to rise modestly throughout the year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of the naysaying bothers Kathleen Gillman, an interior designer, and her son Patrick, a real estate agent, who bought a $200,000 town house in Orlando at a Transeastern sales event last Saturday. Four months ago Mr. Gillman bought another house nearby, his mother said, adding that it is now worth $50,000 more. ''It is interesting how many different viewpoints are out there about whether it's going to level off now, go on for 10 more years or one more year,'' she said. ''Right now we're going to take the viewpoint that it's certainly not over yet.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">COMMON sense suggests that the situation on the home market -- demand far outstripping supply, home values going up, up, up -- cannot go on much longer. Of course, common sense suggested precisely the same thing a year ago, and was entirely wrong.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The 2004 market was very, very strong,'' Jeffrey G. Otteau of the Otteau Appraisal Group said after analyzing year-end statistics on sales contracts from 18 counties around New Jersey. ''And it still has plenty of life in it.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were 14 percent more home sales in 2004 than in 2003, which was itself a record-setting year, he said. Fierce demand on the part of home buyers continued despite rising home prices, a slight rise interest rates and a larger number of homes for sale -- 10 percent more in 2004 than in 2003 -- Mr. Otteau said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His prediction for 2005? More of the same: a rising number of house sales, and another 5 to 10 percent overall increase in the value of homes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers agree with the rosy report and salubrious forecast.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our company had 12 percent more sales last year,'' said Pat Hoferkamp, president of Burgdorff ERA. ''Sales prices were up 10 percent. Every January, it seems, you say to yourself: 'My God! Can we have another record-breaking year?' If the economy continues as it has, and interest rates don't go up too much, I believe it will be.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jacelyn Botti, president of Weichert Realtors, said: ''All the underpinnings that drive the industry are identical to a year ago. Inventory levels in every Multiple Listing Service in every county in the area we cover -- New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Delaware -- are about where they were a year ago, when they were historically low.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Otteau did sound a cautionary note about homes priced at $1 million and above, saying activity in that sector was slowing and prices were starting to stagnate, but Mrs. Botti said she disagreed. In her view, even that market remains robust.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In 2003, we had 1,001 transactions involving homes priced at $1 million and above,'' Mrs. Botti said. ''In 2004, we had 1,637 transactions -- a 64 percent increase.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Of course,'' she continued, ''a $1 million house today is different than a $1 million house a few years ago. It might be a simple Cape or three-bedroom ranch in some communities. Still, the market between $1 million and $2.5 million is very strong. It's only when you get to $5 million plus that I would agree the market is less active.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kathy McCormick, a regional vice president for Coldwell Banker in New Jersey, laughed at the idea that the high-end market is languishing. ''There is a projected 1 million population increase for the region in the next 10 years,'' she said. ''The high rollers have to live somewhere. Manhattan, Westchester, New Jersey -- there aren't any bargains in any of those markets, but New Jersey stacks up very favorably.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. McCormick said that even in places like Short Hills, where the average home price has risen to $1.2 million, multiple bids are common.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Various brokers in the field did agree with Mr. Otteau, whose East Brunswick-based company supplies information to real estate companies, as to what is the hottest sector of the market: homes priced at $400,000 and below.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Homes for the entry-level buyer are selling fastest, and that is where we see the largest price increases,'' Mr. Otteau said. ''The other top-performing sector is age-restricted housing, for those beginning to make a lifestyle change at 55 or older. Active-adult homes are absolutely red hot, and price increases are very rapid.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also pointed to several ''secondary markets'' that have caught fire recently. These are communities adjacent to the most-desired towns where the supply for homes for sale is scant relative to demand. Buyers boxed out of such towns as Short Hills and Montclair are snapping up houses in nearby towns like Maplewood, South Orange and West Orange, Mr. Otteau observed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Some great towns were sort of left behind in the boom of the 90's,'' Mr. Otteau said, ''and have recently been rediscovered because of their abundance of older colonial and Tudor homes of above-average consumption quality, excellent locations and comparatively affordable prices.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, urban markets are increasingly in demand, according to many real estate professionals. In Hoboken and Jersey City, new condo developments are selling out before the ink dries on the plans, Mrs. Botti of Weichert said, adding that this had helped make Hudson County, where those towns are located, ''the hottest county in the state.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Otteau Group's year-end report identified several counties where demand clearly outstripped supply in 2004. These include Cumberland County, where there was a 28 percent increase in the number of homes sold and a 2 percent drop in number of homes on the market last year compared with the year before; Essex County, which had 5 percent more home sales and 9 percent fewer homes listed; Hunterdon, with 14 percent more sales and 5 percent fewer listings; and Somerset County, with sales up by 5 percent and listings down by 8 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, Ocean County, an awakening area, had 67 percent more homes sold than during the corresponding month in 2003. Mr. Otteau saw two reasons for that: home prices are comparatively low, and the 55-and-over market is booming in the shoreline communities.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bergen County, meanwhile, had 4 percent fewer sales this December than last, and looking at all of 2004, sales did not increase compared with 2003. ''Homes are higher priced in Bergen County,'' Mr. Otteau said, ''and that is the explanation.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, though, Mr. Otteau reported a certain balance. Statewide in 2004, the supply of homes for sale grew at nearly the same pace as demand. The number of listed homes was up 8 percent, while the number of sales rose 9 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales activity in 2004 exceeded sales activity in 2003 in every month except July, when interest rates stopped going any lower. ''Because of the end of rate reduction, and because of large price increases up to then, the market took a pause,'' as Mr. Otteau put it.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Sometimes, buyers need a little time to regroup, reassess, get over the sticker shock,'' he said. ''There was a lot of press back then regarding the possibility the market could collapse, reports on how the market in California had turned, and could we be next?''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Well,'' he said, ''we weren't. New Jersey is already very densely populated, with restrictions on further development, making property dear. With a projected high rate of population growth and a continuing increase in the rate of household formation, there is every reason to see the market continue going gangbusters in '05.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WITH growing urgency, civic groups and politicians have been warning that the rise in housing costs on Long Island is a dire problem, that younger workers can't afford to live on the Island and that the resulting ''brain drain'' is casting a shadow on the region's economy. According to a new poll by the Rauch Foundation of Garden City, the warnings are sinking in.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The poll found that 89 percent of Long Island residents were concerned about the issue, with 42 percent describing themselves as extremely concerned. The anxiety crossed all distinctions of race, age, income or education, the poll found, and was more acute than in the other New York City suburbs, which were surveyed for comparison's sake. Only 28 percent of respondents in New Jersey and the northern suburbs described themselves as extremely concerned about the problem.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But though the survey suggests a population united in its diagnosis of Long Island's problems, opinions diverge when it comes to the remedy. And another new study, by the Long Island Regional Planning Board, even questions the existence of a root cause of all the concern: the brain drain.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Census Bureau reported that Long Island experienced a 20 percent decline in its 18-to-34-year-old age group from 1990 to 2000, a drop five times the national average. But the Regional Planning Board study, which was released this month, suggested that the decline was not due to an exodus, but to a dip in the number of births 20 years ago. The study also questioned the logic that housing costs have driven away the young, pointing to a swell in the population of Suffolk County over the past few years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The increase of 20-34-year-olds in Suffolk County of 4,000 between 2000 and 2003 has occurred as median home prices have risen from $201, 470 to $333, 521,'' the study said. ''Why, if home prices were such an important determination of location, would we not see a continuation of decline in this age group?''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the brain drain, whether real or perceived, has apparently struck a chord with Long Island residents, said Nancy Rauch Douzinas, the president of the Rauch Foundation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The brain drain is really a symptom of what is happening,'' she said. ''The brain drain is related to lack of affordable housing, to the kinds of jobs we have here, to the fact that there's no transportation to get to the jobs.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The poll is part of the second annual Long Island Index, a report the Rauch Foundation sponsored in a joint project with academic, civic, business and labor groups. The index, which was formally released on Thursday, draws statistics from the census, economic reports and other data sources, as well as from the poll, which was conducted by the Stony Brook University Center for Survey Research from July 13 to Aug. 21 last year. Results were based on responses from 1,106 adults on Long Island, 302 in New Jersey suburban counties and 305 in the northern suburbs, including Rockland, Orange, Westchester and Fairfield counties. The margin of error was 3.5 percentage points on Long Island and 5.6 percentage points in the other suburban areas.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the Long Island Index covers topics from mass transit ridership to pesticide use, there is a chosen topic each year that receives particular attention. Last March, when members of the report's advisory committee met to discuss possible topics for this year, they noticed that the reaction to the last year's report had especially fixed on the brain drain idea, Ms. Douzinas said. After looking at several other topics, the committee concluded that the brain drain and the other issues were shaped by a more fundamental one: land use.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report says only 67,000 acres of vacant, developable land remain on the Island, a tenth of its total land area or roughly the size of the Town of Islip. The report predicted that in 2050 only 6,000 acres of vacant, developable land would remain.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing is far and away the main acreage eater, accounting for nearly half of Long Island's land. The report showed that from 1980 to 2000, residential development expanded by about 47,000 acres, nearly twice the area of expansion by commercial, industrial and institutional development combined. During those years, the amount of vacant and agricultural land declined by 40 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Accelerating the trend is the fact that Long Island residents, who have been fleeing New York City for more space since World War II, have always craved single-family homes. Eighty-six percent of the poll respondents on the Island said they lived in single-family homes, while the number was just under 70 percent in the other suburban areas.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With millions of dollars in public money being spent to preserve open space from development, and with some municipalities setting higher minimum acreage requirements for new property, the land that is left is being claimed at an ever faster rate. How that affects housing prices is just basic economics.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The land use patterns that in one sense made all that growth possible in the early 50's have now become unsustainable,'' said Carrie Meek Gallagher, the report's director.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though they have long been an issue on Long Island, housing costs seem to have become a more urgent issue after they were coupled with the brain drain idea. In the index released last year, 61 percent of respondents thought the departure of young people because of housing costs was a serious problem. In this year's report, that figure was 89 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The willingness of more and more Long Islanders to understand the importance of the workforce housing issue to both the quality of life on Long Island and the economy on Long Island is very, very helpful and hopeful,'' said Mitchell Pally, vice president for government affairs for the Long Island Association, the largest business association on the Island and a leading campaigner for affordable housing initiatives. ''More and more people are either being affected directly by it or know people who are being affected directly by it.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seven in 10 of those surveyed on the Island were concerned that the high cost of housing would force members of their family to leave their county. In New Jersey, only 64 percent were concerned and in the northern suburbs, 59 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The poll showed that many Long Island residents are open to new housing policies. Building rental apartments in downtown areas, for example, won broad support, as did requiring developers to set aside a portion of new projects for affordable housing. While this may indicate a decline of the Nimby mentality, a closer look at the poll makes this conclusion harder to draw.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one question, respondents were asked whether they would support a proposal to build housing on former industrial, commercial or government sites no longer in use. Around three-fourths supported the idea. But when asked whether they would support a change in zoning laws to allow a limited increase in the number of apartments or town houses in areas zoned for single-family homes, less than half said yes, with only 18 percent describing themselves as strong supporters.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As long as you propose something other than single-family detached in a residential area, you're dead in the water,'' said Lee E. Koppelman, the executive director of the Long Island Regional Planning Board.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A slight majority of Long Islanders supported allowing two-family housing in an area currently reserved for single-family housing within a mile of their homes. But a majority opposed a low-rise apartment building within a mile. Higher buildings were also unpopular. In every category, homeowners were less open to such changes than those who did not own homes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the poll, questions about support for lower-cost housing referred to it as ''affordable middle-class and starter housing.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We did try to make it very clear that we were not trying to get people's opinion about low income or public housing,'' Ms. Gallagher said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the 2004 Rauch Foundation poll, the question was posed more directly. Respondents were asked what they thought about ''having more housing available in your community to those who earn less than $60,000,'' and specifically mentioned ''lower-income families.'' Even so, 65 percent had a favorable reaction, with only 22 percent opposed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ms. Gallagher said it was difficult to truly gauge attitudes when the questions are hypothetical.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's hard to determine until you have an actual development project that's going to happen,'' she said. ''It's hard to get people's real reactions.'' Despite the wording of this year's poll, the negative connotations of affordable housing seemed to be on many minds. A majority agreed that likely consequences of affordable housing could include higher local taxes and increased traffic, but also declining school quality, lower property values and an influx of the ''wrong kind of people.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most pervasive obstacle to supporting affordable housing policies, the report said, was an anticipated decline in school quality. Respondents who linked affordable housing with declining schools were likely to oppose most of the specific policy proposals, which could indicate that some still associate affordable housing with images of urban decay.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Koppelman said that the shortage of moderately priced homes was being widely portrayed as merely a brain drain problem. But the need went much deeper, he said, though into less politically safe territory.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In terms of our need for affordability, let me point out that we need this housing not only for the middle-class worker, we need it for the senior citizens, we need it for the working poor and we need it for the disabled poor,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Future battles may also be seen in the answers to questions about open space. Though a 77 percent majority supported a county policy of purchasing land and preserving it as open space, support dwindled somewhat when more detailed questions were asked.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One does not have to look far to find a possible cause: more than two-thirds of respondents thought that open space purchases would be likely to raise house prices. As a logical consequence, opinions fell along certain lines.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Those in the lowest income bracket,'' the survey reported, ''were less supportive of government purchase of land for preservation purposes, as were younger people.'' Blacks and Hispanics were also less inclined to support the policy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One question asked whether residents would support a $60 property tax increase to support an open space program. People with graduate level degrees supported the idea by 71 percent to 25 percent. Those with no high school opposed the idea by 50 percent to 41 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This tension between widely shared open space ambitions and affordable housing needs could grow as the land squeeze gets tighter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's going to be a war zone,'' Dr. Koppelman said. Any doubt about how resistant Long Island residents are to an influx of more people, he said, should be dispelled by the recent bond referendums. Long Island residents are shown by the report to be paying among the highest taxes in the country, and 93 percent of those polled said that high property taxes were a serious problem. Yet, this past year, they voted for $255 million in new debt to preserve undeveloped land.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You can't get a clearer indication than that we're willing to spend our own money to keep more development away from us,'' he said.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, the Long Island Index found that 18- to 34-year-olds were leaving Nassau and Suffolk counties partly because of high housing costs, noting a 20 percent decrease for that age group between 1990 and 2000. A study released this month by the Long Island Regional Planning Board suggests that the decline among 20- to 34-year-olds was due to a dip in the birth rate 20 years ago.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From central Brooklyn to the South Bronx to the farthest corners of Staten Island, new homes in the city are being built in numbers not seen in a generation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2004, the city approved the construction of 25,208 housing units in New York City, more than in any year since 1972, according to newly released census figures. By comparison, in the last boom year of 1985, reflecting a successful housing program under the Koch administration, about 20,300 units were permitted; in 1994, however, there were 4,010.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This rapid growth, like most economic development trends in New York, stems in part from the policies of city government, but more importantly from the confidence of the private market, which is building and financing homes in neighborhoods best known 10 years ago for their brisk crack trade and overwhelming economic misery.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There has been development activity in places that would have been inconceivable 10 years ago,'' said Carol Abrams, the spokeswoman for the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, which works with developers to rehabilitate and develop housing. ''There has been the absolute transformation of the boroughs,'' Ms. Abrams said. ''New immigrants or longtime residents now want to plunk down their life savings for a place in Mott Haven or East New York.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building spurt reflects a confluence of factors, including the city's rising population -- fueled in large part by immigrants who are willing to take a chance on underdeveloped areas that are no longer riddled with crime -- as well as the city's continual housing shortage and protracted low mortgage rates.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The thing that is amazing is that everyone thinks of the real estate community in New York as Manhattan,'' said Shaun Donovan, the commissioner of the housing preservation department. ''And yet Manhattan is fourth out of the five boroughs in permits.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Driving this trend, Mr. Donovan said, is the tide of new immigrants and middle-class New Yorkers who are making a go in newly safe neighborhoods. ''During the 1990's, New York City added more people than live in entire cities in the United States,'' he said. ''Clearly the really unprecedented boom in immigration is driving a large part of the increase. But also people are staying who once might otherwise have moved out.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to United States Census Bureau statistics released yesterday, Queens County leads the housing boom, with permits issued last year for 6,853 units. Brooklyn was just behind, at 6,825 permits. Even Staten Island, which has been fighting development in many neighborhoods, had 2,051 permits for homes, which will probably be developed over the next few years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2002, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced a $3 billion plan to create tens of thousands of low- and middle-income housing units in New York City over five years, through both the repair and preservation of 38,000 units of existing housing and by building 27,000 new units in all five boroughs. His plan called for a complex financing deal in which the city's Housing Development Corporation would borrow against that agency's mortgage equity.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of this year, 26,000 units have come under development, and his administration is offering a loan program in cooperation with four commercial banks to develop thousands more abandoned or decaying properties in the city.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, developers around the city have found that there is a market for housing in many neighborhoods considered anathema a decade ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There has been a concerted effort on government's part to help finance housing,'' said Jason Bram, a regional economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. ''This is mostly true in poor neighborhoods, where they go in and other developers say, 'Aha, now there is an anchor!' and now the whole neighborhood improves.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps unsurprisingly, Bloomberg administration officials credit the mayor with much of the boom.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This mayor is responsible for the single largest housing boom this city has ever seen,'' said John Crotty, executive vice president of the Housing Development Corporation. ''The market is so hot right now there is no area that is bad for development. Developers have made investments in places where no private money would ever go into.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year the housing agency issued $1.1 billion in bonds to create and preserve new housing, the largest amount since the federal tax reform act of 1986, Mr. Crotty said.  </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Vacant Land on Long Island Is Disappearing, Study Warns  </span>
</div><div class="author">By BRUCE LAMBERT  </div><div>949 words</div><div>27 January 2005</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2005 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new study warns that Long Island is rapidly running out of the essential ingredient that spawned America's first suburbs there after World War II: vacant land.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only a tenth of the island remains to be developed, according to the annual Long Island Index report being issued today. The challenge now, the study said, is rationing the remaining space and redeveloping older properties and communities to address critical problems like high local taxes and the ''clear and present crisis'' in housing that has priced out the elderly, recent graduates and people with modest incomes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Quite simply, we are running out of space,'' the report said. ''The sprawl that has typified Long Island's development cannot be sustained.'' The report added that ''virtually all our region's most serious problems are either caused or aggravated by sprawl.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index, the second annual analysis of issues confronting Long Island, was sponsored by the Rauch Foundation, a nonprofit research and investment organization, in cooperation with government planners, business and labor leaders, educators and other nonprofit groups. The new report focused on land use ''because it's the most powerful factor'' linking other issues, said the foundation's president, Nancy Rauch Douzinas.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If made wisely, the report said, decisions about future land use would alleviate the island's most pressing issues: extraordinarily high property taxes, the scarcity and high cost of housing, congestion, traffic problems and inadequate mass transit, and threats to the environment.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The ultimate irony of our development is that after 50 years of home building, Long Island's residents today face a dire shortage of housing,'' the report said. ''Home prices continue to skyrocket and new homeowners spend over 40 percent of household income on homeownership costs.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median home price on Long Island is $394,000, 4.7 times the median annual household income -- and far above the ratio of 2.5 that housing experts recommend for affordability, the report said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Polling of 805 residents by the foundation revealed deeply conflicted feelings on housing issues.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A strong majority recognized the gravity of the housing shortage, with 74 percent calling it an extremely or very serious problem. Seventy-one percent voiced fears that high housing costs would force family members to leave the island, and 64 percent said they themselves had thought about moving away.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A majority also endorsed solutions that some politicians have long considered taboo, like adding more apartments in older downtown areas near train stations, and requiring developers to make a tenth of any new homes they build moderately priced. A majority also said that they would support the construction of town houses and apartments within a mile of their own homes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet at the same time, a majority also voiced fears that such measures would diminish suburban life by increasing tax burdens and congestion, reducing the quality of schools and even bringing in ''the wrong kind of people.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those concerns are understandable, the study's authors said. But they added that proper planning could reassure the public by addressing the potential pitfalls of more development. For instance, zoning rules to limit local populations so schools are not overburdened with students who cost more to educate than the tax revenues derived from the developments where they live.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The ambivalence makes a lot of sense, because people have a lot invested,'' Dr. Douzinas said. She called the support for solutions ''a hopeful sign that should give political and community leaders the courage to put a vision out there.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report did not recommend any particular solutions, but it did list possibilities like more town houses, government-subsidized housing and legalized apartments in single-family homes, favored by 55 percent of those polled.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long Island, comprising Nassau and Suffolk Counties, is the most developed suburb in the New York metropolitan region, the report said. The supply of open land is dwindling fast, with only 67,000 acres remaining to be developed. That number excludes land committed to open-space uses like parks, golf courses and nature preserves.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From 1980 to 2000, the amount of land devoted to residential use grew to 314,693 acres from 267,238 acres. At the same time, farmland dropped to 35,328 acres from 51,178, and vacant land shrank to 78,270 acres from 138,545, the report said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides the high cost of homes and apartments, residents bear taxes that ''are among the highest in the country,'' the report said. In 2002, the most recent year with comparable figures, Long Islanders paid an average of $2,445 per person in property taxes. That was more than double the national average of $969 and significantly higher than statewide averages of $1,402 in New York, $1,734 in Connecticut and $1,872 in New Jersey. Long Islanders also pay high sales taxes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Better use of the vacant land and redeveloping existing properties, like polluted ''brownfields'' formerly owned by industries, can provide more jobs and generate revenue to ease tax burdens, the report said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its critique of past poor planning, the report said that housing was often not situated near employment centers, and that expressways and the Long Island Rail Road were geared mainly for commuting to New York City rather than to local employers, where most residents actually work.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the third consecutive quarter, the average sales price of an apartment in most of Manhattan breached the $1 million barrier, although it slipped slightly from the previous quarter, according to an appraiser's report scheduled for release today.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average sales price of $1.04 million in the last three months of 2004 was 2.6 percent below the $1.07 million average in the third quarter, but was still 15.3 percent above the quarterly average of $903,259 a year earlier, according to the Prudential Douglas Elliman Manhattan Market Overview, which surveys the real estate market below 96th Street on the East Side and below 116th Street on the West.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And apartments became even scarcer, with the number of available listings falling more than 23 percent from the previous quarter, the report said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan Miller, president of Miller Samuel, the appraisal firm that prepared the Elliman report, said jitters about the presidential election and concerns about increases in interest rates had led some buyers to hold back, which dampened prices in the final quarter. ''Some people were reluctant to pull the trigger during the election, especially in the first month of the quarter, in October,'' Mr. Miller said on Friday. Indeed, according to the report, the number of sales during the quarter dropped 15 percent from the previous quarter, to 1,987 from 2,337.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dottie Herman, chief executive of Prudential Douglas Elliman Real Estate, said sale prices traditionally dip in the last quarter. ''I didn't see any red flags'' for 2005, she said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, according to the Elliman report, the median price -- the exact midpoint -- rose 2.3 percent to $670,000 in the last three months of 2004, a 15.5 percent increase over the last quarter a year ago. But the average sales price of luxury apartments -- defined as those in the top 10 percent of all sales -- fell 10.7 percent, to $3.67 million. Mr. Miller said one reason was that the average square footage of those apartments was down 7.4 percent, to 2,690 square feet. Average prices were still 15 percent above the same period in 2003.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Herman said she expected prices to rise again this year, though perhaps not as significantly as in the past few years. She said demographic trends would continue to drive New York real estate, with empty nesters from the suburbs, families choosing to stay in Manhattan and European investors taking advantage of the strength of the euro all vying for the supply of apartments.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of co-ops and condos available for sale dropped 23.3 percent to 3,922 units in the final quarter of 2004, down from 5,112 units in the third quarter. That was the sharpest quarterly decrease in available listings in four years, Mr. Miller said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slim pickings led some buyers to get creative. A couple represented by Louise Phillips Forbes, a broker with Halstead Property in Manhattan, were looking for a three-bedroom apartment on the Upper West Side, but found little to entice them.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When they realized that their best choices were a $3 million apartment on Riverside Drive that Ms. Forbes said needed a ''complete face-lift,'' or a three-bedroom apartment in what she described as a ''B building'' on 72nd Street, the couple, who already own a one-bedroom apartment, offered $1.45 million last week to the owner of the two-bedroom apartment next to them, which they plan to combine with their apartment. Ms. Forbes said the couple would pay a 30 percent premium over comparable sales prices in the building.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Full-year figures from the Corcoran Group, one of the largest real estate brokers in Manhattan, showed that sales price appreciation was particularly strong downtown, as well as in emerging residential areas like Midtown East and Midtown West, defined as the neighborhoods between 34th and 57th Streets.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pamela Liebman, chief executive of the Corcoran Group, said, ''A lot of buyers were flocking to Midtown East and Midtown West because they are priced out of the traditional Upper West Side or Upper East Side neighborhoods.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average yearly sales prices were up 20 percent in Midtown East, and 21 percent in Midtown West. Downtown prices were driven up by new condo developments offering luxury amenities, attracting buyers who might have previously stayed uptown. According to Corcoran, the average sales price of downtown condos increased 23 percent to $924,000. Average loft prices rose 35 percent to $1.49 million.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reid Price, a broker with Corcoran who sold 28 loft apartments in the Hubert, a new luxury condo development in TriBeCa, said, ''I think that it brought a lot of buyers from uptown as well as people who were empty nesters from Connecticut who were looking for a lifestyle change.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sellers enjoyed price increases in the boroughs outside Manhattan, too. Average sales prices in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, increased 35 percent in this year compared with 2003, according to the Corcoran report.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fort Greene ''has been infiltrated at an unprecedented level'' by buyers and developers from Manhattan, said Jerry Minsky, a Corcoran broker. Mr. Minsky said that in December he helped to sell 18 apartments, including a $1.2 million penthouse, in the GreeneHouse, a luxury condo in Fort Greene. Prices, which started at $600 per square foot, increased to $845 per square foot by the end of the month. Mr. Minsky said he also sold a three-family brownstone town house for $2.15 million in December. He said he believed that this was the first sale of a private residence in Fort Greene for more than $2 million.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, renters are getting hit with higher rents. According to a report from Citi Habitats, a residential real estate brokerage firm, average Manhattan rents increased to $2,397 in 2004, from $2,334 in 2003.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More significantly, said Andrew Heiberger, president of Citi Habitats, landlord concessions like a month's free rent and assistance with broker fees were disappearing. Mr. Heiberger said that of 1,300 buildings tracked by Citi Habitats, 150 now offered such perks, compared with 500 in 2003. Average vacancy rates in those building also dropped, from 3.25 percent at the end of 2003 to 1.55 percent at the end of 2004.   </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes rose 2.7 percent in November, making 2004 the best year ever for housing, the National Association of Realtors said yesterday in Washington.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing homes sold at a 6.94 million annual rate, up from a 6.76 million pace in October. A record 6.14 million existing homes have been sold this year, surpassing the 6.1 million in 2003.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The real estate market just went from red hot to white hot,'' James Gillespie, chief executive of Coldwell Banker Real Estate, which is based in Parsippany, N.J., said in an interview.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The creation of more than two million jobs in the last year, income growth and 30-year mortgage rates below 6 percent have bolstered housing and the economy as homeowners spend more on furnishings and appliances.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median selling price of an existing home was $188,200 last month, up 1.5 percent from $185,400 in October, the statistics showed. The median price is up 10 percent from November 2003, the biggest 12-month jump since July 1987.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales rose in the West, South and Midwest and declined in the Northeast. The inventory of houses for sale held at 4.3 months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists had forecast that previously owned home sales in November would reach a 6.75 million annual rate, the same as the previously reported pace for October.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing homes account for 85 percent of the residential real estate market in the nation. The realtors group expects 6.38 million previously owned homes to be sold in 2005, the second-best on record.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes are based on contract closings and tend to lag statistics based on signings, like new home sales.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 30-year mortgage rates averaged 5.84 percent in 2004, holding near last year's record low of 5.83 percent and helping drive home sales to all-time highs, Freddie Mac said.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By FLOYD NORRIS  </div><div>701 words</div><div>24 December 2004</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2004 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NO boom lasts forever, and in countries like Britain and Australia, the housing market has suddenly turned lower, leading to discussions of how a plunge can be avoided and what will happen if it is not.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The American housing market received a scare yesterday, with a report that the pace of new-home sales slipped in November as the median price of a new home fell to the lowest level in a year. But mortgage applications indicate that a rebound has begun, and in any case, prices of new homes can fail to capture price trends for existing homes in areas without new construction.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A more reliable measure, albeit one that is reported more slowly, is an index that compares prices over time on the same house and is put together by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, which regulates Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Even though the index excludes many higher-priced homes, and thus probably understates house price inflation, it is booming like never before.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through the third quarter, it showed prices up 13 percent over the previous 12 months. The index, which dates to 1980, had never before recorded even a 10 percent annual gain. In the last five years, the index shows a gain of 48.5 percent, while consumer prices for things other than housing have risen 11.8 percent. The absolute gain and the spread over inflation are records. The only time that was even close was the period through 1989, which was followed by a housing bust in 1990 that caused prices to plunge in some areas.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If this is a bubble, its creation can be traced in no small part to the Federal Reserve's efforts to deal with the bursting of the stock market bubble. It cut rates aggressively and the 2001 recession was a mild one. The very low cost of borrowing, coming at a time when alternative investments seemed less desirable, encouraged a big run in home prices, whose growth outstripped both personal income and rental prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are indications that speculation is rising. Patrick Lawler, the chief economist of the agency that compiles the index, reports that the popularity of interest-only and adjustable rate mortgages is rising. That would indicate more and more buyers are straining to qualify for loans -- and would be vulnerable if interest rates rose.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market would not have to collapse to have a negative impact on the economy. Even a lack of appreciation could put a damper on consumer spending by depressing sentiment and the volume of refinancings.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House prices vary significantly by market, of course, and it is reasonable to think that a decline in prices would be most likely in areas that have had the strongest gains. And those areas are concentrated in states that voted Democratic in the last election. Of the 12 states with the fastest-rising home prices in the last four years, only Nevada and Florida voted for President Bush. The 12 states with the smallest gains all backed Mr. Bush.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, states that supported Senator John Kerry averaged a 47 percent rise, while prices in Bush states climbed 24 percent. Rhode Island and California led the list of states, although neither could match the 80 percent rise in the District of Columbia. In California, the median-price home costs $460,000, and the state association of Realtors says only 19 percent of the state's residents earn enough to afford to buy such a home.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the trade deficit hitting records, the American government seems to welcome a weak dollar. But there are surely limits to that. A nightmare for the Fed would be that it finds itself under pressure to raise rates to support the dollar, just at the time that a weakening housing market needs lower rates to avoid big declines. If that were to happen, the Fed might regret having done so much to encourage the boom in home prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Graph shows the difference between the five year gain in home prices and rise in consumer prices for items other than shelter.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, Dec. 16 -- First-time claims for unemployment benefits posted the sharpest drop in three years last week, but starts of new housing plunged in November, the most in nearly 11 years, government economic data showed Thursday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department reported that initial jobless-benefit claims dropped in the week ended Saturday to 317,000, the lowest level since July, Wall Street economists had expected a dip to 340,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patrick Fearon, an economist with A.G. Edwards, said this ''brings the claims number back down to a level that's really very positive.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department reported that housing starts dropped 13.1 percent last month, the steepest fall since a 17 percent drop in January 1994. Housing starts slid to an annual pace of 1.771 million units in November from an upward revised pace of 2.039 million units in October.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE biggest boom ever in the price of America's houses -- four straight years of gains averaging almost 7 percent annually -- is losing steam.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many markets, houses that once would have attracted swarms of buyers and multiple bids are no longer snapped up in a weekend. Fewer sell for more than the original asking price. Some builders are again offering concessions to overcome newly revived price resistance, and more deals are falling through.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've been in a frenzy'' in real estate the last two years, said S. Lawrence Yun, senior economist for the National Association of Realtors. ''In 2005, we're going back to a more healthy balance.'' He forecasts that the pace of price increases will slow to 5.3 percent next year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lowest interest rates in a generation have fueled demand, the main factor causing prices to rise. But most analysts agree that the market will cool off, although some worry that the market has become so severely overvalued that prices could fall in some areas, as they did in California in the 1990's.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason for the cooling could be heavy recent speculative buying, with people acquiring houses in hopes of a quick profit without making improvements to the homes. Such purchases contributed to a 12.97 percent surge in average home prices from the third quarter of 2003 to the third quarter of 2004, the biggest four-quarter increase since 1979, when inflation began to rise at double-digit rates, according to the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight. That was almost five times the gain of other goods and services measured by the Consumer Price Index.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price for existing single-family homes reached $191,000 last June, up from $170,000 in 2003; it settled at $187,000 in October, according to the most recent figures available from the agency. Property held by speculators, now estimated to account for as much as 15 percent of sales, represents hidden inventory that could suddenly be put up for sale should the market sour.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deceleration of prices expected next year -- the rise for 2004 is estimated at 6.9 percent -- reflects an almost certain continuation of increases in interest rates by the Federal Reserve, analysts said. David F. Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders, predicts that rates on conventional 30-year mortgages will average 6.40 percent next year, up from the current 5.75 percent, and will reach 6.75 percent by the end of 2005. He nevertheless projects that 1.87 million new homes will be built next year, only 4 percent fewer than the 1.95 million likely to be built this year. That includes a record 1.6 million single-family homes.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Current prices are at record levels in relation to average incomes, so higher interest rates would almost certainly make purchasing a home harder for prospective buyers. The low rates of recent years have helped buyers afford more expensive houses.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales-damping effect of higher interest rates might, however, be offset by an increase in employment, which could give more people the cash and the confidence to buy homes.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Houses have appreciated 1.5 to 2 percentage points faster than the rise in the Consumer Price Index. With inflation at about 3 percent, the 7 percent advances in house prices in recent years are at least twice the norm.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest median price for a home is $266,400 in the West; $217,900 in the Northeast; $170,400 in the South; and $152,000 in the Midwest. Areas with the biggest increases in the sale prices of houses in the 12 months ended Sept. 30 were Nevada, Hawaii, California and the District of Columbia and Rhode Island.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW Jersey ranked 8th, New York 12th, and Connecticut 13th in growth of house prices. The weakest growth was in Texas followed by Utah, Indiana, Mississippi and Alabama.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many industry analysts said they believed that the new year would bring continued, if more subdued, gains as the nation's homeownership rate approaches a record 70 percent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Although more locations are now at greater risk of a home-price decline than a year or two ago, a sharp correction is unlikely unless the economy unexpectedly contracts,'' the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard reported in its annual appraisal.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Yun, the analyst for the Realtors' association, said in October, ''Homeowners can expect $10,000 equity gain from home-price appreciation in 2005.'' Increases in personal wealth from higher home values have significant effects on the economy at large. Economists have estimated that each dollar increase in real estate assets generates 8 cents of additional spending that year while the same gain from stocks and bonds adds only 2 cents to spending.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The overall economic effect of a rise in home values next year could be muted, however, because fewer people are refinancing their mortgages as interest rates rise. Over the last four years, falling rates have led homeowners to tap the equity in their homes while lowering their monthly payments, freeing up money to spend. But the Mortgage Bankers Association of America predicts the volume of mortgage refinancings will slide almost 43 percent next year, to $680 billion from an estimated $1.19 trillion in 2004.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though more people than ever already own homes, economists say that several factors will work to keep the demand for houses robust. Inventories of available housing are low, for example, because environmental and other constraints limit new supply in some of the hottest markets. And immigration provides a steady source of new buyers, since immigrants rate owning a home as their top priority -- more so than the general population.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That could compensate somewhat for the fact that fewer first-time buyers can afford homes. The housing affordability index for first-time buyers stood at 74.7 for the third quarter of this year, down from an average of 79.7 for 2001 to 2003, according to the office of housing oversight.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That suggests that a family with a median income made less than 75 percent of the money needed to qualify for a mortgage to buy a median-priced starter home, which jumped to $160,200 in the third quarter from $125,600 in 2001. The index for the third quarter shows median income for first-time buyers was $31,225. (By contrast, the index for all buyers remains relatively high -- 132.2 in October. That suggests that a family with a median income had more than enough money to buy a median-price home.)   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're going to see more moderate price appreciation'' next year, said Nicolas Retsinas, director of the Harvard center. ''If you're buying a house now primarily for investment, you're probably going to be disappointed. But if you're buying to live in it, though it's not riskless, in the long run you should be fine.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of an editing error, the National Perspectives column on Nov. 28, about San Francisco neighborhoods where houses are still affordable, misstated a neighborhood name at one point, as did the picture caption. The name is Portola. (Portola Valley is a separate town about 35 miles south of San Francisco.)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FINDING a place to buy in San Francisco is a daunting task for all but the wealthy, as housing prices continue to increase despite a shrinking population and job losses from the bursting of the Internet bubble.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average price of a single-family home in San Francisco has risen around 16.5 percent in the last year, to $952,715 from $817,976 in 2003, according to the San Francisco Association of Realtors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sarah Stangle and her husband, Chris Buck, are both from Connecticut and lived in New York City before moving to San Francisco. Having rented in Manhattan and Brooklyn, they didn't want to move 3,000 miles across the country only to be forced 30 miles outside the city because they couldn't afford to buy anything.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We didn't want another apartment or loft, which is what we were in before,'' said Ms. Stangle, 30, who works in advertising. ''So we focused on neighborhoods in the city where we could afford an outright house.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Affording a single-family house in San Francisco's more established neighborhoods -- like Pacific Heights or Noe Valley -- was out of the question for Ms. Stangle and her husband, who works for a nonprofit environmental organization. And with condominium conversions tightly regulated -- only 200 units are allowed to convert each year -- even if Ms. Stangle and Mr. Buck wanted to go that route, their options would still have been limited and expensive.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To their surprise, single-family homes are available and affordable in San Francisco on the southern side of the city in traditionally working-class neighborhoods where public transportation is less than desirable and the non-Victorian housing stock doesn't make for a ''wish you were here'' postcard. Neighborhoods like Portola, Excelsior and Bay View don't roll off of most agents' tongues, but increasingly, that's where young professional first-time home buyers are ending up. The latter is where Ms. Stangle and Mr. Buck bought their four-bedroom house with a yard and two-car garage for $449,000 in 2002. Though Bay View is only three miles from downtown, it's still considered a peripheral area by most people who didn't grow up there.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If someone wants a house, that's where they have to go,'' said Robin Hubinsky, an agent with Zephyr Real Estate, San Francisco's largest independent real estate agency. ''The housing stock that's out there is 90 percent single-family. If you want a house and you want to pay $600,000 or less, you can't go anywhere else. In some of these 'peripheral areas,' it's great to discover that they're really only peripheral in your mind. In reality, they're safe and stable and community-oriented.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While there is a small but growing influx of young professionals into these neighborhoods, they're still a long way from gentrified, Mr. Buck said. In addition to some environmental issues from a closed Navy base, Bay View has a high crime rate.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the most part, however, the couple feels completely at home. The first weekend they arrived, one neighbor brought over a plateful of food and another neighbor left a bag of apricots on their front porch harvested from her own tree.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having the space of a house was a great help when Ms. Stangle's mother needed to move in with them because of illness. ''We couldn't even have taken her in if we'd purchased a condo in an established neighborhood,'' Ms. Stangle said. ''There just wouldn't have been room.'' But not only did they have the room, within a year a house across the street came up for sale, which her mother bought for $459,000. ''The amazing part about buying both our houses is that we paid asking price. That is unheard of in San Francisco. Houses are routinely priced $100,000 under value to encourage bidding wars, and that is just exhausting.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While houses in these neighborhoods are often sold at asking price, the prices themselves are starting to climb. Single-family homes in District 10, which includes most southern neighborhoods, have increased, on average, by $89,796 in the last year, according to statistics compiled by the San Francisco Association of Realtors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Compared to other parts of the city, you can get more house for your money,'' said Piotr Pawlikowski, another Zephyr real estate agent, who recently sold a house in Excelsior to a single professional woman for $710,000. ''Because of that, there is a generational change happening in areas like the Excelsior. But there's no such thing as a bargain in San Francisco.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stacey Fowler and her husband, Brian Malenfant, both in their early 30's, lived in a one-bedroom rent-controlled apartment for eight years. Then, when Ms. Fowler became pregnant, they knew they had to make a move.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's this whole pocket of neighborhoods, all south, near the freeway and heading toward Candlestick Park,'' Ms. Fowler said. ''They're working-class areas, and the houses were built in the 50's and they just kind of got forgotten about. But once we started looking there, it took us less than a month to find a place.'' They paid $425,000 for a two-bedroom house. Within 18 months, their property, in an area known as the Portola Valley, has appreciated by $100,000, and they're preparing to refinance to take advantage of the increased equity.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're right next to McLaren Park,'' Ms. Fowler said. ''Most people don't even know about this park. It has all these rolling hills and trees. When you say where you live, people think it's not a great place, but it's fine. We wanted a diverse neighborhood, and since we moved in, two more families have moved in with babies. So we're very happy.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For first-time buyers who are not inclined to live in those neighborhoods, the only other entry point into the San Francisco real estate market is through a tenancy in common. Stephan Alm and his wife, Sara, teamed up with Vahram Massehian and his wife, Daliah, to purchase a two-unit building as a tenancy in common. They share a $750,000 mortgage and have spent about $45,000 getting the property up to code as required by the condo conversion regulations. Pooling their resources was the only way they could enter the real estate market in Bernal Heights, an established neighborhood that sits on a hill overlooking the Mission District.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We looked at a few single-family homes in peripheral areas, and it just didn't meet our needs,'' Mr. Alm said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While horror stories of failed tenancy-in-common relationships have pushed some buyers into more affordable neighborhoods where they can purchase a single-family house, the arrangement has worked well for the Massehians and Alms. Both couples are now expecting their first child. ''We're living parallel lives,'' Mr. Massehian said. ''We'll raise the kids together and share that responsibility as well.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, Nov. 23 -- Sales of existing homes edged down 0.1 percent in October, but low mortgage rates continued to contribute toward what might become a record year in home sales, a trade association report showed on Tuesday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.75 million units last month from an upwardly revised pace of 6.76 million units in September, the National Association of Realtors said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have got the best of all worlds,'' the chief economist at the association, David Lereah, said, adding that low interest rates and a spreading economic expansion were powerful forces that could propel sales this year to their best performance ever.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We feel there is some momentum going into 2005, and we are closing 2004 on a strong note,'' Mr. Lereah said. ''This will shatter all records. We are still on track for 6.5 to 6.6 million units'' this year. That would compare with 6.1 million units in 2003, which also set a record.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts had been expecting a drop to a rate of 6.70 million units from the 6.75 million units originally reported.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gary Thayer, chief economist at A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons in St. Louis, said the report showed that the housing market remained solid. ''The decline in mortgage rates we saw this summer continues to support housing activity,'' he said. ''It generally looks like a good report.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national median home price rose to $187,000, up 8.8 percent from a year earlier, the report said.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GOOD gracious, imagine what houses will be selling for 10 years from now!'' exclaimed Jo Falcone, a real estate agent in White Plains, commenting on the record high median sales price for a single-family home in Westchester. ''Every year, we think the bubble is going to break, but it doesn't,'' said Mrs. Falcone, who works for Century 21 Wolff. ''The prices just keep going up and up.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to data from the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service, the median price for a single-family home in Westchester soared to $686,000 in the third quarter, which ended on Sept. 30. That was 16.6 percent higher than the corresponding three months in 2003, when the median price was $588,250.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest figure tops Westchester's previous median price record of $660,000, which was set during the second quarter of this year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Riffling through listing sheets of houses that sold in July through September, Mrs. Falcone plucked one out of the stack and offered it as example of the stunning level of the current market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The listing was a late-1950's split-level with three bedrooms and two and a half bathrooms on slightly more than a quarter acre in White Plains. The house fetched $699,000 in early September.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've been in this business for 20 years, and I never imagined that a split like this would go for so much money,'' she said. ''Here we are, almost at $700,000.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That same split-level home, according to Mrs. Falcone, would have sold for $125,000 to $150,000 in the early 1980's, when she began working as a residential broker in the county. Based on the rate that the overall cost of living has risen in the New York region, a house selling for $150,000 in 1980 would be expected to go for less than $370,000 now.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not only has the median sales price for single-family homes soared, but sharp increases were registered in all categories of homes during the third quarter of 2004. The median price for a condominium reached $349,000, up 15.2 percent from a year earlier. For two- to five-family houses, the median was up 16.6 percent, to $495,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The largest percentage increase, 27.2 percent, occurred in Westchester's co-op sector, where the median climbed by $34,000 from a year ago to a new high of $159,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 25 percent of Westchester's single-family sales were for $1 million or more in the third quarter, up three percentage points from the second quarter of 2004. And 18 percent of the houses sold for $750,000 to $1 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE pace of sales activity -- as measured by the number of closings of properties -- was robust for all types of housing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reaching its highest level in five years, the total number of closings in the third quarter was 3,267, the most for any quarter since the third quarter of 1999, when there were 3,359 closings. Real estate professionals say the third-quarter closings largely reflect marketing and sales activity that took place in the second quarter, April through June. Over all, 2004's third quarter sales volume was 6 percent more than last year's.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Listing Service attributed the robust market to low interest rates for mortgages and favorable job conditions. At the end of October, when the report was issued, Westchester's unemployment rate was below 4 percent, and the interest rate on a 30-year mortgage stood at an average of 5.84 percent for the area.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The late spring and early summer months provided a good environment for pumping up the local real estate market,'' the report said. It also noted that interest rates ''have not yet embarked on the climb that was anticipated to commence nearly a year ago.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greg Rand, managing partner of Prudential Rand Realty, which has offices throughout Westchester, observed that while consumer confidence about the overall economy may be somewhat shaky, confidence in housing as an investment has been strong. He described ''a massive migration of wealth moving from Wall Street and banking investment vehicles'' toward investment in real estate, because of the volatility of stocks and bonds and their relatively low recent returns.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But John Russell, a sales agent at Prudential Holmes &amp; Kennedy's office in Chappaqua, is more restrained. Noting that the recent report reflects offers accepted earlier in the year, he said the market has slowed. ''There are definitely not as many buyers, and the ones there are seem willing to wait until they find the right house at the right price,'' Mr. Russell said. ''Sellers shouldn't expect that their houses are going to keep rising sharply up in value.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the inventory of homes on the market has dropped, as it often does when sales are strong. For all categories of homes, inventory was down to 4,952, from 5,250 at the end of the second quarter. Nevertheless, the latest inventory level was 8.9 percent higher than the level of a year earlier. The listing service attributed the increase to homeowners who had previously hesitated but finally decided to put their homes on the market to take advantage of strong demand and high prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based on the performance of the market so far this year, the listing service predicted that 2004 might challenge 1999 for the highest number of annual sales. At the end of September, 7,723 sales had been posted in Westchester this year, just 142 fewer than the number sold during the equivalent period in 1999.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A developer's proposal to pay into a housing fund rather than to provide below-market price units within a White Plains condominium complex has come under criticism by affordable housing advocates.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ASB Capital Management Inc. of Washington, which is developing a 13-story complex at Church Street and Barker Avenue, has asked to opt out of a city zoning requirement that 6 percent of the units be set aside as affordable housing. The units would be made available to those whose earnings are 80 percent or less than the median income of $74,700 for a family of four in Westchester.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contending that creating affordable housing units would be a financial hardship, ASB Capital Management asked to take advantage of a provision created last summer that would allow it to pay into a fund -- the amount ranges from $30,000 for a studio and one bedroom to $40,000 for three bedrooms -- which would be much less costly.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our objection to that is that it does not create any more affordable housing,'' said Jean Pollak, chairwoman of the White Plains Affordable Housing Committee. The White Plains Common Council has asked the developer to explain why creating the lower priced units would not be feasible, said Thomas Roach, council president. BARBARA WHITAKER  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned houses rose in September to the third-highest pace on record, evidence that low borrowing costs were attracting buyers and helping sustain the economic expansion.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 3.1 percent increase brought sales last month to an annual rate of 6.75 million single-family houses, from 6.55 million in August, the National Association of Realtors said yesterday. The pace in June was a record 6.92 million. The association forecasts that 2004 will be the best year ever for sales.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Real estate has been and will continue to be a pillar of the economy,'' said James R. Gillespie, president and chief executive of Coldwell Banker Real Estate in Parsippany, N. J. ''There are no concerns for me at all as far as the economy and housing.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Declining mortgage rates are driving sales even as rising oil prices and lackluster job growth weigh on the economic expansion. The three hurricanes that pummeled Florida kept sales from rising further, the association said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median forecast called for resales to fall to an annual rate of 6.51 million from a previously reported 6.54 million for August.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The housing market just refuses to falter,'' said Joel L. Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pa. ''With mortgage rates quite low, there is little reason to expect demand to drop suddenly.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Resales account for 85 percent of the residential real estate market in the United States. Sales were a record 6.1 million last year. The association forecast on Oct. 5 that sales this year would climb to an annual rate of 6.49 million before easing back.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a speech yesterday at a conference of mortgage bankers in San Francisco, Franklin Raines, the chief executive of Fannie Mae, warned that housing prices may be rising too fast in some markets.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gains in some areas of the country are being fueled in part by investor demand, Mr. Raines said. Fannie Mae is the biggest provider of mortgage financing in the United States.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've spent a lot of time over the past few years arguing that there is no 'housing bubble,''' Mr. Raines said. ''And nationally, that's still true. But we are seeing investor-driven price increases in certain markets, some within this region. And these markets could soften as investor demand wanes, as it inevitably does.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An index of housing prices is up 9 percent in the second quarter from a year before, the fastest four-quarter increase since 1979, Mr. Raines said. The difference, he said, is that in 1979 the rate of inflation was 11 percent, while today it is 2.4 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The data indicate that this price increase is being fueled in part by a big increase in investor demand over the past three quarters,'' Mr. Raines said.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, Oct. 19 -- Consumer prices picked up momentum in September, with the most difficulty for people paying for medical care, education and gasoline, the Labor Department reported Tuesday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts said that although inflation is not a danger to the economy now, the acceleration justifies an interest rate increase next month by the Federal Reserve. They expect the Fed to lift short-term interest rates for a fourth time this year at its meeting on Nov. 10.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government's most closely watched inflation measure, the Consumer Price Index, increased 0.2 percent in September, up from a 0.1 percent rise in August. Excluding energy and food prices, which can vary widely, so-called core prices rose 0.3 percent. That compared with a 0.1 percent increase in August.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in core retail prices mostly reflected a sharp increase in lodging costs, not a broad acceleration in the prices of many goods and services, economists noted. Given that, the increase in core prices rings no alarm bells, analysts said. The 0.3 percent rise surpassed the 0.2 percent some economists were forecasting. Over all, the 0.2 percent price increase matched expectations.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among areas with notable price increases, medical care rose 0.3 percent last month, education was up 0.6 percent and lodging, 2.9 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent run-up in crude oil prices notwithstanding, energy prices in September dropped 0.4 percent, after a 0.3 percent decline in August. Natural gas also fell, and electricity prices were flat. Economists expect a sizable increase in energy prices when the report for October is released next month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Social Security Administration said Tuesday that recipients of benefits would receive a 2.7 percent cost-of-living increase in their checks starting in January.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department reported that housing construction fell 6 percent in September. Housing permits rose 1.8 percent.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By JULIETTE FAIRLEY  </div><div>737 words</div><div>17 October 2004</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>9</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2004 New York Times Company  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JANICE ALLAMBY, a public-school teacher, was renting an apartment in the Bronx when she began shopping for a co-op. She quickly learned that she could not afford the places she was seeing, but she heard about a city-run lottery for middle-class New Yorkers under the New Housing Opportunities Program, known as New-HOP.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Allamby, 39, got lucky. Her name was selected from among 1,232 applicants for 129 units, and she, her husband and their 12-year-old daughter got a two-bedroom, two-bath co-op at East 118 Street and Madison Avenue last June for $162,000. The couple qualified on their combined income of $80,000, and made a 5 percent down payment of the co-op purchase price. The maintenance and monthly mortgage payment totaled $1,750.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I doubt we would have been able to buy it without the program because it would have cost triple of what we paid for it,'' Ms. Allamby said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As housing prices climb, more middle-class New Yorkers need help buying their first home. Although there are grants and matching programs for people living below the poverty level, similar programs for middle-class home buyers are less well known.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not just the lower classes that need help these days,'' said Sandi Abadinsky Baer, a spokeswoman for the Enterprise Foundation, a nonprofit organization based in Columbia, Md., that helps local communities build and maintain affordable housing. ''It's teachers, firemen and service workers that are struggling.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York, middle class is defined as a family of four living on a combined annual income of $62,800 to $125,600, according to guidelines set by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development. Accordingly, the maximum income to qualify for a New-HOP property is $125,600.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city can hardly keep up with the demand. Through New-HOP, the New York City Housing Development Corporation provides 1 percent mortgage and construction financing to developers of multifamily buildings who agree to sell or rent units at below-market prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2003, 3,000 potential home buyers submitted applications for 124 new co-op and condo units at 1400 Fifth Avenue, at East 116 Street, where a one-bedroom was selling at $158,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are doing the best we can to serve the middle-class population,'' said Tracy Paurowski, a spokeswoman for the Housing Development Corporation. ''By the end of 2004, we expect to close in financing provisions for 400 units, including 111 co-op units under construction at East 119 Street.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's plan is to build or renovate 65,000 units over five years, said Emily A. Youssouf, president of the Housing Development Corporation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike the city's middle-class housing plan, most national grant, or ''gift,'' programs don't use income as a criterion for financial assistance.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Recognizing that saving a lump-sum down payment is the biggest challenge, we gift up to 10 percent of the home,'' said Ann Ashburn, chief executive of AmeriDream, a nonprofit housing assistance organization based in Gaithersburg, Md. ''If they can qualify on a loan through the lender and the only problem is the down payment, that's where we can come in.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anyone can apply for AmeriDream's ''downpayment program,'' regardless of income level, to buy homes valued at up to $333,700.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In gift programs like AmeriDream and others, including the Nehemiah Program, Housing Action Resource Trust and the Home Buyers Assistance Foundation, the seller of the condo or single-family home pays the gift amount plus a $500 processing fee, which can then be deducted as a charitable contribution. It is up to the buyer to find a seller who will agree to participate in one of these programs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rather than face that challenge, and all the paperwork that goes along with it, most middle-class home buyers resort to loan options.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When a buyer comes to us, we have a vast product list of mortgage programs,'' said Steven B. Schnall, president of the New York Mortgage Company in Manhattan. ''We can do 100 percent financing without having to deal with a program like this. For those who want to take advantage of available gift programs, we have specialty lenders who are equipped to handle their needs.''  </p>

</div><div>By Bloomberg News</div>
<div>471 words</div><div>28 September 2004</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>4</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2004 New York Times Company  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes jumped 9.4 percent in August, higher than economists had expected and the biggest gain since the end of 2000, the Commerce Department said yesterday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family home sales increased to a 1.184 million annual pace last month, led by surging sales in the West and South, from a July rate of 1.082 million units, which was slower than first estimated.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists had forecast sales at an annual rate of 1.155 million last month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes increased in three of four regions. They rose 6.1 percent in the Northeast, to 70,000 at an annual rate; 13 percent in the South, to 536,000 at an annual rate; and 20 percent in the West, to 356,000 at an annual rate. Sales fell 8.3 percent in the Midwest, to a 222,000 pace.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median selling price in the United States dropped to $208,900 in August from $214,400 in July, reflecting a greater percentage of homes built for less than $125,000, the Commerce Department said. Prices are 9.7 percent higher than they were in August of last year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory of new homes for sale dropped to a 4.2-month supply in August from 4.4 months, while the number of new homes for sale rose to 404,000, the highest since October 1979.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median number of months that new homes are on the market before being sold rose to 3.8 months from 3.7 months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're starting to see signs that we're close to the top of the housing market,'' said Wesley M. Beal, an economist at the financial research firm IDEAglobal in New York, before the report. ''New-home prices are starting to moderate and it's taking longer to sell them.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales, which account for about 15 percent of the United States housing market, are a leading indicator of demand because they are recorded when a contract is written. Existing-home sales, which account for the rest, are tabulated at the contract closing, often one or two months after the contract is signed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August, home resales fell 2.7 percent, to a 6.54 million pace, the National Association of Realtors said late last week. Applications to buy a home rose 1.6 percent in August from July, the Mortgage Bankers Association said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Borrowing costs fell in August even as the Federal Reserve raised the nation's benchmark lending rate. The average 30-year fixed rate mortgage was 5.87 percent in August, the lowest since March, according to Freddie Mac, a buyer of mortgages. The rate reached a record low of 5.21 percent last year.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By ANTOINETTE MARTIN  </div><div>1112 words</div><div>26 September 2004</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>21</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2004 New York Times Company  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THERE were some seesaw dramatics concerning the pace of house sales during the last two months of summer -- down in July, up again in August -- according to fresh numbers on signed contracts in the state's 18 largest counties.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the demand for housing in the state keeps growing, according to statistics and analysis from the Otteau Appraisal Group, a private company based in East Brunswick, which supplies information to the real estate industry.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand keeps rising, according to Jeffrey G. Otteau, who heads the company, because the state's population keeps growing so fast. Referring to federal census figures and updates, Mr. Otteau noted that in the 1990's, New Jersey's population grew at a rate of 68,000 a year. But from 2000 through 2003 the pace of growth racheted up to about 75,000 new New Jerseyans a year -- a large proportion of them immigrants.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Of the 224,000 more people in the state during those three years,'' Mr. Otteau said, ''191,922 were foreign emigres.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, Mr. Otteau noted, foreign-born residents now account for about 12 percent of the population over age 25. He added that 27 percent of foreign-born residents hold bachelor's degrees, compared with 22 percent of those born in this country. Mr. Otteau said he had not been able to calculate precisely how that played out in New Jersey, but his advice to real estate professionals is, ''We are dealing with an educated population, part of the work force, who are moving into the housing market at a relatively young age.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During July, there was a distinct slowdown around the state in the number of contracts signed, as mortgage interest rates began to inch up and the number of houses put up for sale continued rising. There were 6 percent fewer contracts signed in July 2004 compared with July 2003, while there were 14 percent more homes on the market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in August, while the supply of homes for sale remained 14 percent greater than last year, contract sales were up 10 percent over the previous August.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the year to date, sales contracts are up 8 percent compared with 2003, which was itself a record-setting year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These statistics are based on numbers of signed contracts, rather than the number of sales that have actually closed, which is the data that more widely reported multiple listing service reports employ.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Statistics may shift slightly by the time the listing-service analyses become available, according to knowledgeable real estate brokers, as some deals fall through or are renegotiated. But reports on signed contracts provide early tips to brokers -- and homeowners and homebuyers, for that matter -- who try to stay on top of industry trends.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Otteau Group's July-August report shows that what heated the market back up again in August was very high demand for the lower-priced half of the residential market -- houses priced at roughly $500,000 and below.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''While I was expecting to see a drop in the number of home sales July to August, based on the June to July drop,'' Mr. Otteau said, ''instead, interest rates moderated, and there was a real surge in sales in lower-priced areas.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those counties with the biggest increases in sales activity during August included Camden, Cumberland, Hunterdon, Ocean, Salem, Sussex and Warren.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, places where homes are more expensive, such as Bergen, Essex, Monmouth, Morris, Somerset and Union Counties, had lower increases, or in some cases declines, in the number of home sales.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, the good news about this trend: ''The overall trend of continuing strong demand for homes is pretty clear,'' Mr. Otteau said, ''giving the New Jersey market good underlying dynamics across the state.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''By the same token,'' he quickly added, ''once interest rates begin to rise further, the effect may be disproportionate on those buyers in the market who can afford the least -- and cause a more serious slowdown in sales.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the state's poorest county, Camden, the number of contract sales were down 10 percent in July -- when interest rates had risen slightly -- compared with the previous July. In August, as interest rates dropped ever so slightly in New Jersey, the county registered a 19 percent increase in sales.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the beginning of August, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rate in the state dropped from about 5.75 percent to 5.5 percent, according to Otteau's analysis.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other things affect the picture in Camden County and elsewhere, of course. The inventory of housing for sale in Camden was up 32 percent compared with the previous year -- with strong redevelopment efforts including construction of hundreds of condominiums along the riverfront in the city of Camden, which has been identified as the state's poorest city for more than a decade.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In more affluent Morris County, sales volume was sharply down from the year before -- 21 percent -- in July, and rebounded in August to 7 percent ahead of the previous August.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Bergen County, the number of contracts fell 16 percent from last year in July, and rose 1 percent in August. In Essex County there were declines in the number of contracts signed in both July and August, of 11 and 5 percent, respectively, compared with 2003.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Otteau, who said he tries to keep national trends in mind when analyzing the New Jersey market, said that he sees three main factors driving its success right now -- and that all of them are expected to continue: the high rate of foreign immigration, migration from New York, and baby boomers buying vacation homes, particularly along the Jersey shore.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New York-to-New Jersey movement, which heightened after the Sept. 11 attack three years ago, is the second highest rate of interstate migration in the country -- just behind the rate of New Yorkers moving to Florida, according to updated federal census figures.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Ocean County, the hottest spot for new housing for over-55's, inventory is up 39 percent this year to date.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Otteau report noted that although the general inventory of homes for sale is up 14 percent from a year ago, the inventory last year was ''drastically undersupplied.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand will continue to rise faster than new housing, Mr. Otteau predicted, citing diminishing land for construction, increasing land prices and increased regulation of development.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home construction in the United States unexpectedly increased in August to match the highest level of the year as mortgage rates fell, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. Building permits declined.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts rose 0.6 percent to a 2 million annual rate, after a 1.988 million pace in July, the Commerce Department said. The August total matched March as the highest of the year so far.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction permits, a sign of future activity, dropped 5.5 percent, to a 1.952 million annual pace.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction lags home sales, so it may be several months before the declines in sales in June and July show up in fewer starts. A measure of the inventory of homes for sale increased to the highest since February 2003, according to recent data.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starts of single-family homes rose 0.4 percent in August, to a rate of 1.667 million units, after a 1.66 million pace a month earlier. Starts of multifamily dwellings rose 1.5 percent, to a 333,000 annual rate.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By region, housing starts rose 1 percent in the South, to 907,000 at an annual pace. They rose 4.8 percent in the Midwest, to 370,000. They were up 6.5 percent in the Northeast, to 196,000, the highest since February 1990. But they fell 4.7 percent in the West, to 527,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builder backlogs that are higher than a year ago will underpin housing and help contribute to economic growth, economists said. Moves by the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates since June have yet to lead to higher mortgage rates, which are tied to longer-term Treasury securities.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate has declined about a half percentage point since June 30, when policy makers raised the overnight bank rate for the first time in a year. Yesterday, the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee raised the rate for the third time this year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage fell to 5.75 percent last week, according to Freddie Mac, a purchaser of home loans.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE endless cars and trucks, locally referred to as the ''trade parade,'' that daily clog the two-lane main roads of the North and South Forks in the mornings and late afternoons typically have one thing in common: their drivers cannot afford to live in the communities where they work.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''More than half the people who work on the East End can't afford to live there, and they travel that trade parade to find affordable housing,'' said Jim Morgo, the president of the nonprofit Long Island Housing Partnership in Hauppauge and the director of Suffolk County's new work force housing commission.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The workers commute up to 100 miles round trip daily from the west, where homes in communities like Mastic and Shirley in southeast Brookhaven and even as far away as Islip are more affordable than on the upscale East End, Mr. Morgo said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The traffic has increased to such a point that the East End's two largest towns -- Southold on the North Fork and Southampton on the South -- are establishing programs or agencies to try to create housing that would be affordable for their work forces.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median annual income for the five towns on the East End is $68,864, according to Roy Fedelem, principal planner for the Suffolk County Planning Department. That compares with a median of $85,400 for all of Long Island.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Morgo said that using standard rules of thumb, a typical family earning the median East End income could afford a house selling for no more than $200,000. He added that the median value of homes on the East End is more than double the cost of what the majority of its work force can afford.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the town of Southold, the supervisor, Joshua Y. Horton, said the ability of local workers to afford a home has been steadily decreasing for the past five years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Six years ago, you could still purchase a house in Southold for $150,000, but with skyrocketing real estate values you can't find one for less than $400,000 today,'' he said. ''People have suggested they can produce a home here for $250,000, which may be a steal in today's real estate market, but it's still not affordable in Southold. Here, the median family income is less than $60,000 and lenders generally require you to triple the amount of your annual income to estimate how much you can afford for a house.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, the Southold Town Board unanimously approved legislation that would require developers to build one affordable house for every three market-priced houses in new subdivisions of five homes or more.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These are bold steps, Mr. Horton said, and the town is taking them in part to ensure that the diversity of its population is not reduced. ''If the teachers can't afford to live here and have to come from Mastic and Shirley, my child won't get to see the human side of these people, outside of the classroom,'' said Mr. Horton, who grew up in the town.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He noted that Founders Village, a decades-old market-rate housing development for people 55 and over in Southold, is of a style and density that might work for housing that would be affordable to workers in the town.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the South Fork, the discrepancy between income and housing costs is even greater, said John C. White, Southampton's first director of housing. He heads the town's one-year-old housing department and oversees its new housing authority, which was created several months ago to address the work force housing issue.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Southampton has a resort character with a strong second-home market and a strong work force, which provides services to that market and the local businesses,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Approximately 75 percent of the people working in the town have annual incomes below $70,000, he said. ''Correlate that with the housing costs and you have a problem,'' he added.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median Southampton house is valued at $475,000, according to Mr. White. ''Triple the $70,000 income, and you come up with $210,000,'' he said. But, he noted, virtually nothing exists in the town at that price and there is very little listed in the $300,000 to $400,000 range.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The town is looking comprehensively at the housing needs that are reflected in the marked increase in traffic, Mr. White said. Measures under consideration include clustering homes on smaller lots, incorporating plans that would allow for apartments over stores and allowing accessory apartments that would permit a resident to add an apartment to an existing home.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suffolk County is tackling the issue on a broader level. Earlier this year, it created a 24-member work force housing commission, which includes local officials, environmentalists, builders and business leaders. They are looking at several possible solutions, including some that would identify an inventory of potential sites that could be redeveloped for the housing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A total of more than 250 possible sites have been proposed by the towns of Southold, Southampton, Huntington, Babylon and Brookhaven and the villages of Greenport and Patchogue, among others, said Steve Levy, the county executive.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''By bringing disparate groups together, we will find out right away if the desire and availability is there to do work force housing on a parcel-by-parcel basis,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The county has also passed legislation providing $15 million for the ''purchase of property that has been identified, and we'll flip it back to the builder for like amounts,'' Mr. Levy said. The parcels would come with the stipulation that a certain percentage would be set aside for affordable housing and would be marketed to builders with preapproved town and county permits in place.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Something must be done about the increasing need for affordable housing, Mr. White concluded. ''If the trend continues, it will drive out those workers who sit in the traffic and pay high gasoline and maintenance costs,'' he said. ''They will go somewhere else. Just imagine if every one of these people stopped commuting for a week. Just stopped. What would that mean? We're talking nurses, teachers, supermarket workers, plumbers. . . .''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To the Editor:  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The article, ''Don't Tell Anyone, but There's This Rich Joke Going Around . . . ,'' Sept. 5, about the high cost of living in New Jersey inspires comment. Apparently the median family income in New Jersey is now the highest in the nation at $70,263.00. I'm single, earn more than that, and I still can't afford to buy a home in Hoboken, where I live.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if I could afford a home here, I don't think I could psychologically bear to pay the ridiculously high taxes. Unfortunately, I can afford a home in New Jersey towns or sections of towns where I don't feel safe, or which are remote from the community I've built. I can't be the only person with semi-deep pockets facing this problem. Is there a politician or developer listening? So, while I'm not eager to move out of state, Ohio, with it's median income of $51,522, looks very attractive. There I'll truly be rich, happily relaxing in the shade of my buckeye trees, and content in the knowledge that if global warming continues along its simmering path, I'll be the proud owner of waterfront property just in time for retirement.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By WILLIAM NEUMAN  </div><div>1181 words</div><div>19 September 2004</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>2</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2004 New York Times Company  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN a real estate boom where prices keep on climbing, who sells a luxury apartment on Central Park for less than they paid for it?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tyco International, that's who.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one of the stranger deals of this annus mirabilis of Manhattan real estate, the scandal-plagued company sold the Central Park South apartment of its former chief financial officer, Mark Swartz, for $3 million less than it paid two years ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 4,729-square-foot apartment at 50 Central Park South, above the Ritz-Carlton Hotel, was bought with Tyco funds for $15.274 million in December 2001. The closing, just after Christmas, came less than three weeks after Tyco disclosed that it was under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission for its accounting practices, the first public signs of the unraveling that eventually led to the corporate looting charges against Mr. Swartz and the company's chief executive, L. Dennis Kozlowski.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lengthy and sensational trial for the two men ended in a mistrial last April, and they are expected to go before a jury a second time early next year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company put Mr. Swartz's 33rd-floor apartment on the market early this year, listing it with brokers at Brown Harris Stevens and asking $15.5 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not surprisingly, in the heat of the current market, a bidding war developed for the high-end property. But in this case, the bidding started well below the asking price, and the winner finally emerged in mid-March with a high offer of $12 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The winner turned out to be a Brooklyn-born millionaire, Gerard L. Cafesjian, a former top executive with West Publishing, the legal publisher based in Minnesota.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Waters Jr., a vice president at Mr. Cafesjian's firm, GLC Enterprises, said the relatively low price came about because the transaction was viewed as a kind of distress sale that could not be completed without the approval of a judge. Mr. Swartz, who was listed as the apartment's ''nominal owner,'' also signed off on the sale, which closed in July, said Charles Stillman, his lawyer. Mr. Stillman defended the original apartment purchase as ''a perfectly proper transaction.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, the apartment is back on the market, listed with Brown Harris Stevens at an asking price of $20 million. The apartment is also being offered for sale in conjunction with a duplex (with another owner) immediately above it, creating a fantasy 10,000-square-foot triplex for a Time Warneresque $45.5 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Waters said that the apartment had been ''soft listed'' and that Mr. Cafesjian was not yet sure if he wanted to keep it or sell it. That's because he has also entered into contract to buy two condos in the Time Warner Center. It will take time, he said, to combine those units, and in the meantime, Mr. Cafesjian will use the apartment above the Ritz.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another Tyco deal, an apartment at 590 Fifth Avenue bought for Mr. Kozlowski by the company has also gone into contract. It was on the market for $24.95 million. The apartment originally cost $18 million and Mr. Kozlowski's lavish decoration included the infamous $6,000 shower curtain and $15,000 umbrella stand.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Tyco spokesman, David Polk, said he could not discuss most details of the sales. Regarding the Central Park South condo, he said, ''We did not lose money on that transaction.'' Because of depreciation, he said, the sale was not recorded as a loss on the company's books.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sale of Mr. Swartz's apartment is the first activity in some time at 50 Central Park South. The 35-story building, which once housed the St. Moritz Hotel, was renovated by Millennium Partners and reopened in early 2002, with the Ritz-Carlton as the new hotel operator and the top 11 floors offered as ultraluxury condominiums with access to hotel services.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Millennium created 11 full-floor units on the building's top stories, offering most of them as raw space. The developer found six buyers, who signed contracts before Sept. 11, 2001, paying as much as $23.7 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the rest of the apartments languished without buyers after the terrorist attack. Earlier this year, Millennium split one floor into two separate fully finished apartments, hoping to draw buyers at a somewhat lower price. The new units, on the 24th floor, were originally listed at $17 million and $14 million. Those prices were cut last month to $14 million and $12 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Matthew Hall, Millennium's vice president of sales and marketing for the property, said the firm had also raised the commission paid to a broker who brings in a buyer, to 4 percent from 3 percent of the sale price.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, this summer, after more than two years without a new sale, Millennium found a buyer for the 9,455-square-foot apartment on the 23rd floor. Richard P. McWilliam, president of the Upper Deck Company, paid $20.8 million in early August for the apartment, which had been listed at $28 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More Development In Hudson Square  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The developers of the new condominium building at 505 Greenwich Street have reached an agreement to buy a vacant lot out their back door, where they plan to start work on a look-alike apartment house.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The idea is to build something that is very consistent with the first building in terms of its skin and its interiors but which is innovative and one step more interesting,'' said Richard Mack, a managing partner at Apollo Real Estate Advisors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apollo and its co-developer, Metropolitan Housing Partners, decided to buy the second site after seeing the strong demand for condo units at 505 Greenwich, which will be ready for new owners to move in next month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mack said 100 of the 104 units at 505 Greenwich, in the Hudson Square neighborhood, had been sold. Prices ranged from $495,000 for a one-bedroom to $3.7 million for a penthouse.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new owners include the interior designer Thom Filicia of the television show ''Queer Eye for the Straight Guy.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mack declined to say exactly how much he was paying for the new lot, a 14,995-square-foot parcel, between Hudson and Renwick Streets, north of Canal Street. But he said it would work out to close to double the approximately $120 a buildable square foot the firm paid for the property at 505 Greenwich. ''We've definitely created value in the neighborhood,'' Mr. Mack said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like 505 Greenwich, the new building is being designed by Handel Architects, but it will be smaller, with about 65 one- and two-bedroom units, with prices of $800,000 to $2 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apollo, which was the majority investor in the Time Warner Center, is seeking to expand its New York portfolio. ''We are looking to do close to $1 billion in deals over the next two years,'' Mr. Mack said.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CONSTRUCTION of houses and apartment buildings is running ahead of last year's soaring levels in New York City as a whole, although not in Manhattan or Staten Island, according to newly updated census figures for the first seven months of the year. The largest increases in new permits were in more affluent neighborhoods on the fringes of the Bronx and Queens, where many market-rate two- and three-family developments were under way. Developers attributed some of the increase to housing construction subsidized by city and state programs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction activity has in some areas led to community opposition and efforts by the Bloomberg administration to limit some development.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, the Census Bureau reported, 21,218 permits were issued for the construction of private homes and apartments in New York City, the most since 1973. The new figures show that through July, the number of permits issued rose by 24 percent from the same period a year earlier. If the current rate continues for the rest of the year, permits would increase by 10 percent for the year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through most of the last decade, Manhattan reported more construction than any other borough. But so far this year it ranks fourth, with 2,295 housing units, after Brooklyn, with 3,803 units, Queens with 3,725, and the Bronx with 2,486. Those four boroughs each gave out more permits than any of the surrounding counties in New York and New Jersey. Staten Island, with 1,280 permits, lagged behind the previous year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter Murray, a partner in the Lowen Development Corporation, active outside Manhattan, said that there was a large unmet demand for housing in those boroughs and that he expected the construction boom to continue. In the Bronx, his company just finished putting up three six-unit condominium buildings on Bowne Street on the water in City Island, despite considerable community opposition. He said all of the units sold for from $450,000 to more than $600,000, or $400 to $500 a square foot.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company is now about to start work on a 46-unit subsidized project in the South Bronx on land it bought at a city auction several years ago. Rents will be set below market and renters will be required to have income of no more than about $35,000 for a family of four, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joseph Salvo, director of the Population Division at the Department of City Planning, said the surge reflects the pressure of population growth, particularly in immigrant communities that have been largely missed by recent census estimates. And rising incomes have enabled many families in the boroughs to afford the higher asking prices on real estate outside Manhattan.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But along with the surge in permits come some problems. Many developers have complained about delays in getting certificates of occupancy from the Buildings Department for completed houses and apartments, forcing buyers to wait for weeks or months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials at the Buildings Department acknowledged that there have been some delays, but said they had streamlined the approval process, reducing the number of approval steps to 45 from 88. JOSH BARBANEL  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one of the most sweeping moves by a local Long Island government to provide affordable housing, the Town of Southold will require developers to build one affordable house for every three market-priced houses in new subdivisions.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 25 percent requirement, an example of what is known as inclusionary zoning, applies to subdivisions of five or more houses and appears to be one of the strictest requirements of its kind in the state. The Town Board approved the regulation unanimously on Aug. 26.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The town program provides incentives to developers by granting them higher densities when they comply with the affordable requirement.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joshua Y. Horton, the town supervisor, said the requirement balanced the town's critical need for housing local families could afford with preservation programs for farms and open space that have strong public support. ''We have to recognize the need to keep people in the town that make the town work,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The town estimated houses that were in the low $300,000 range a year ago now sell for more than $400,000, beyond the reach of many residents. The median house price in the second half of 2003 was $435,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Horton said the town hoped to create a supply of houses selling for $200,000 or less. Current Southold residents earning less than 80 percent of the median family income of about $80,000 a year would be given preference. John Rather  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a five-year surge, house prices in Britain fell 0.6 percent in August, Halifax, a leading mortgage lender, said. The decline could mean that five interest rate increases by the Bank of England since November have damped a boom that doubled many house prices. Despite last month's fall, house prices were still an average 21.3 per cent higher than in August 2003, according to the monthly Halifax house price index. Alan Cowell (NYT)  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York City's poverty rate and median income held steady last year, while housing continued to take an ever larger chunk of New Yorkers' paychecks, according to an annual survey released yesterday by the Census Bureau.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data showed that New Jersey had the highest median income in the nation, but that several other states were in close contention; the margin of error for the survey means the ranking could change slightly.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Connecticut, which also has one of the highest median incomes in the nation, incomes remained steady while unemployment increased, as did the percentage of people without health insurance. The state's poverty rate increased slightly, but by a percentage too small to be considered statistically significant.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data was drawn from the American Community Survey, which collects information from 800,000 households each year in 1,200 counties, and from the more detailed Current Population Survey, which surveys 100,000 households.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The percentage of people in the work force in New York City declined by 1.6 percentage points and the number of unemployed people rose by about 50,000, even as the city's unemployment rate declined, an indicator that some people had simply stopped looking for work.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economic survey was not quite as grim as the national census data released yesterday. That data indicated that poverty rose, incomes were flat and the ranks of the uninsured grew.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But included in the findings was evidence that New York's economy did not rebound in 2003, and that the economic squeeze many families face, created by static earnings and rising housing prices, continued to worsen.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The middle-class squeeze is continuing,'' said Andrew A. Beveridge, a sociologist at Queens College. ''More people are out of the labor force. Median income has not increased. Housing prices continue to rise. There is certainly no big rebound found in the economy.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The poverty rate in New York City was unchanged at 19 percent, far above the national rate of 12.5 percent, and median household income in New York stood at $39,937, a statistically insignificant decline from last year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The percentage of New Yorkers spending 35 percent or more of their household income on their mortgages increased six percentage points, to more than 44 percent of survey respondents. The percentage of New Yorkers paying more than 35 percent of their income on rent also rose, to about 42 percent from 38.5 percent.  </p>

</div><div>By Bloomberg News</div>
<div>443 words</div><div>25 August 2004</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>3</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2004 New York Times Company  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes fell 2.9 percent in July from a record in June, the first drop in seven months, a private report showed yesterday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Resales declined to 6.72 million single-family houses at an annual rate, the third highest on record, after a revised 6.92 million in June and 6.81 million in May, the National Association of Realtors said in Washington.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales were forecast to fall to a 6.81 million annual rate in July. Estimates ranged from 6.5 million to 7.1 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sale price was $191,300, up 8.7 percent from July of last year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising mortgage rates in June, when many contracts for July resales were signed, might have deterred some buyers. The record-setting pace of sales growth set in the first half of 2004 could not be sustained, economists said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've been looking for these numbers to fade for several months now, because they've been so incredibly high,'' said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pa. ''There's almost no place to go but down.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thirty-year mortgage rates averaged 6.29 percent in June, up from 6.27 percent in May and 5.91 percent in April.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The most interesting thing about the July numbers is that they reflect closed properties in June, when interest rates were actually rising,'' said James Gillespie, chief executive of Coldwell Banker Real Estate, a unit of the Cendant Corporation, adding that his company's sales in July rose 11 percent. ''That's a good number any time,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home purchases may also have been aided in recent months by concerns among buyers that rates would continue to increase as the Federal Reserve raised borrowing costs to deter inflation, John Ryding, chief United States economist at Bear Stearns, wrote in a note.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed's Open Market Committee raised the target rate for overnight loans between banks to 1.25 percent from near a 46-year low of 1 percent on June 30, and again to 1.5 percent on Aug. 10. The committee meets again Sept. 21.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of rising with the target rate, mortgage rates have declined. Last week, the typical 30-year rate was 5.81 percent, close to the record low annual average of 5.8 percent set in 1965, according to Freddie Mac, the second-biggest buyer of mortgages.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Cendant Corporation, the travel and real estate services company, said it had ended talks with a potential buyer of its mortgage business. Cendant said it would talk with other possible buyers of the unit as well as consider what it called strategic alternatives. Cendant, which is based in New York, did not identify the potential buyer or say what the alternatives were, nor did it say why the talks collapsed. Cendant said last month that it was in talks to sell the unit for as much as $1 billion. Cendant is divesting itself of businesses that are secondary to its main real estate and travel units. Cendant said last month that after a sale, it would continue to participate in the mortgage business through its residential real estate and relocation units.  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CRAIG AND JAMIE DREZEK made unofficial housing history in Derby earlier this year when they bought a year-old Colonial-style house for $450,000, what area real estate experts said was the most expensive single-family house ever sold at the time in the city and, for that matter, some of the other communities in the Lower Naugatuck Valley.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While $450,000 won't buy a lot in Fairfield County, a price that high for a house in the Valley is a bit of an eye-opener. Long economically depressed as its factories closed, most of the area's municipalities had modest homes at reasonable prices. The six Valley communities, Ansonia, Derby, Shelton, Seymour, Oxford and Beacon Falls, were often where young couples went to buy their first homes.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as prices for houses have skyrocketed in surrounding areas, people are buying homes in the Valley, pushing the median single-family house in 2003 to $230,000, up 50 percent since 1997. In 2000, the U.S. Census recorded population of nearly 100,000, growth of about 7 percent from 1990.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While a housing report released this year found that the average commuting time of Valley residents is about 20 minutes, about 5 percent commute 60 minutes or more, almost double the number in 1990. It is no coincidence that the morning backups on the Merritt Parkway and Interstate 95 often begin where they connect with Route 8, the highway that cuts through the heart of the Valley, as residents head for their jobs in Southern Connecticut and New York.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So many new houses and condominiums are being built that citizen's groups have been forming to scrutinize proposals that come before planning and zoning commissions. In Seymour, which has already issued more building permits in 2004 than it did for all of last year, some residents unsuccessfully demanded that the town impose a moratorium on new subdivisions and impose stricter housing development regulations.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In many cases, the Valley is subsidizing the work force of Fairfield County,'' said Richard Knoll, president of TEAM Inc., a coalition of representatives from organizations that offer services to Valley residents. ''Thirty years ago, the majority of people who lived in the Valley worked in the Valley. The brass and rubber industries have left. Today, there's a significant shift in that many work outside the Valley because they can afford the housing here.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This shift is also creating a concern that young people who already live in the Valley will be priced out of the market. The report on the region's housing market released this year, ''Housing the Workforce: An Assessment of Housing in the All-America Valley,'' sponsored by the Lower Naugatuck Valley Regional Housing Coalition, found that the three leading indicators of what it calls ''housing-cost stress,'' -- house prices, rent payments, and the earnings needed to afford either -- are pricing Valley middle- or upper-middle-class households out of the market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Being able to afford housing in the Lower Naugatuck Valley region is quickly becoming a major issue for households with surprisingly high levels of household income,'' the report states, highlighting workers such as police officers, firefighters, teachers and nurses. ''Further, the data show that housing-cost stress in 2003 in the Lower Naugatuck Valley region is occurring at household-income levels,'' about $40,000 to $50,000, that are higher than in the past.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report found that housing prices have grown three times faster than the average household income, making housing virtually unaffordable for some Valley residents. For instance, teachers in the Valley would have to spend about 74 percent of their incomes to buy the average-priced house in Ansonia, which is $153,000, and a police officer would have to spend 83 percent, the report said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The housing market has just exploded in the Valley,'' said Barbara DeGennaro, a Derby lawyer who does real-estate closings. ''I just had a client who bought a house in Shelton six years ago for $300,000 who just sold it for $500,000. On the other hand, some of my client base, which is made up of Valley people, say they can't afford to buy what they want here anymore. Houses in the Valley are way out of their price range.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jaws are dropping at property transactions like the Drezek's nearly half-million-dollar home, said William C. Nimons of Ansonia, senior vice president of Naugatuck Valley Savings and Loan in Naugatuck. Mr. Nimons said he recently was involved in the sale of an Oxford lot on which a new house will be built for about $600,000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If somebody thought they were going to buy a house in the Valley for $200,000, they are going to find out that they are few and far between,'' he said. ''And, at this point, that type of house is probably going to need a lot of upgrades or improvements.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Drezek said that part of the reason he and his wife were able to afford their 4,300-square-foot house is that their previous house, a Colonial they bought for $190,000 in 1996 in Seymour, sold for $357,000 in 2003.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''At that time, I knew, based on what we had sold our house in Seymour for, that things were changing drastically in the Valley,'' said Mr. Drezek, who will begin his first year as principal of Derby High School later this month.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2000 census found that the Valley's population increased 6,700, or about 7 percent, to 99,567 from the 1990 census. The 2000 census also shows that almost 40 percent of the Valley's population is in Shelton, the only Valley town in Fairfield County. The rest are in New Haven County. The Valley housing report said Shelton and Oxford contain the most undeveloped land in the region.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits have also jumped. Just through June, the six Valley communities had issued 52 percent more permits, 224, than for all of last year, when they issued 147. Oxford alone had issued 102 permits through June, up from 64 last year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University in New Jersey and an author of the 2004 study, ''The Beginning of the End of Suburbia?'', said development was slowing in the areas closer to New York, such as Fairfield County, and people are now buying homes in outlying areas, willing to withstand longer commutes.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One result is that development is being channeled back into older development areas, old urban places,'' he said. ''The secondary effect of that is the resulting spillover into the rural areas farther outside of the metropolitan region. The economic glory of these areas is long since passed. These cities will offer developments and housing that is more affordable.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rate of new housing development is of such concern in the Valley that citizen groups are putting pressure on planning and zoning commissions.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nancy Steiner of Shelton is one of the founders of WE R-1, a group of Shelton residents fighting what they call the overdevelopment of housing. Ms. Steiner said the group was trying to change zoning laws to prevent the Planning and Zoning Commission ''from gobbling up our one-house-per-one-acre regulations'' to allow high-density, cluster housing in residential sections.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When I moved here, Shelton was bucolic and the land was gorgeous and precious,'' she said. ''Now developers stand to make much larger profits on less land.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nimons of the Naugatuck Valley Savings and Loan said he was seeing builders, developers, and real-estate companies buying older houses, rehabilitating them and putting them back on the market at prices 30 to 40 percent higher.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They are pushing the first-time homeowner out of the market,'' he said. ''If only one of a couple is working, they are not going to be able to buy a house unless they have a substantial down payment.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some solutions to the housing problem include renovating empty factory, school and historic buildings, updating older houses, improving public transportation, planning subdivisions better and offering incentives for developers, Mr. Knoll of TEAM said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing report suggests developing zoning policies that encourage the construction of affordable housing, such as exemptions for the number of units built on a parcel if 10 percent or more are deemed affordable. Another option is creating homebuyer programs intended to create incentives for people to buy houses either in or near the communities in which they work. Such a program would provide mortgages at below-market rates, down-payment assistance, closing-cost subsidies and mortgage insurance to qualified buyers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Each community is unique and has its own thoughts about smart growth,'' Mr. Knoll said. ''I'm particularly interested in an ordinance in Stamford that requires a developer to build one unit of affordable housing for every 10 units built.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nimons said solutions would be difficult.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've been in the Valley all of my life and I've seen it all,'' Mr. Nimons said. ''I've never seen an environment where prices ratcheted up and didn't come back down. But even if the prices do come down 10 percent in our area, it's still not going to bring back affordable housing to the first-time homeowner.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With condominium prices soaring, Mario Procida, a seasoned developer from the Bronx, decided that the building he was putting up at 53 Boerum Place in the first of a swath of residential buildings going up on the edge of downtown Brooklyn could make it as a condominium, rather than a rental.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So he put in the usual condo upgrades: a 24-hour concierge, a workout room, granite counters and stainless steel appliances. Then, he added one more high-technology feature to lure young Wall Street executives from just across the river. It is an integrated home network, with support for stereo speakers, computer networking, cable and telephone in every room.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These in-the-wall home networks, common in expensive suburban homes and featured in such high-end condominiums as One Central Park, in the Time Warner Center, are becoming a standard for many new condominiums under development.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You would be at a disadvantage today, not doing high-tech wiring in a building,'' said Andrew Gerringer, managing director of the development marketing group at Douglas Elliman.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the new building, to be known as Boulevard East because it faces a wide boulevard leading to the Brooklyn Bridge, there will be two jacks in each room, with combination outlets leading to a central box. The box will include a computer networking router, with switches to easily configure telephones room by room and send cable inputs to specific outlets.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephen Allen, president of Integrated Technology Systems, which installed the hardware, said the system at Boulevard East would be unusually advanced. It will, he said, allow homeowners to easily hook up a network-capable plasma television set and show movies downloaded on their home computers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To add to the tech-friendly atmosphere, there will be a laundry room, and residents will be able to reserve machines from their computers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are several hundred apartments under construction in downtown Brooklyn, and a city master plan for development of the area calls for about 1,000 apartments to be constructed. Most of the development sites are at the edge of long-gentrified neighborhoods like Boerum Hill and Cobble Hill.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boulevard East, one block from the southern edge of downtown Brooklyn, is next to the Brooklyn Criminal Court Building, and across the street from the Brooklyn House of Detention, now closed. The 11-story building will have 99 apartments, including 49 two-bedrooms, 40 one-bedrooms and 10 studios. It was designed by Stephen B. Jacobs and developed by a joint venture known as the SDS/Proceda Venture.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cheryl Nielsen-Saaf, a broker with the Corcoran Group who is marketing the apartments, said prices would range from $250,000 for large studios to $700,000 for the most expensive two-bedroom. It is scheduled to open this fall.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE number of home sales in New Jersey rose 11 percent in the first half of 2004 over the same period last year, according to the latest report from an East Brunswick-based appraisal company that supplies information on trends in home sales.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeffrey Otteau, president of the company, the Otteau Appraisal Group, which publishes its quarterly findings at otteau.com, called the increase in sales strong evidence that the residential real estate market continues to thrive despite rising mortgage rates.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It should be noted, however,'' Mr. Otteau said, ''that the market has lost some ground in the last three months, as year-to-date home sales were running 16 percent ahead of last year through the end of March, but slipped to 11 percent ahead of last year by the end of June.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Otteau said this trend suggests that the combined effects of rising mortgage rates and still-rising home prices mean fewer people can afford to buy homes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Otteau called it noteworthy that the inventory of homes being offered for sale increased 12 percent -- from 25,270 in the first six months of last year to 28,325 this year, or an increase of 3,055 homes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new report's statistics on the number of homes under contract for sale in each of 18 counties across the state that the company includes in its study tends to show a pattern of increased supply in a tug-of-war with rising demand.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Bergen County, for example, where the inventory of homes on the market was up 5 percent, the number of contracts rose only 4 percent. In Hunterdon County, which had 8 percent fewer homes on the market in January through June 2004, the number of contract sales was up 22 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morris County, however, had 9 percent more homes for sale through June of this year compared with last year; the number of sales contracts was up 7 percent. Essex County's numbers were similar: 9 percent more homes for sale, and 9 percent more sales.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Ocean County, which is increasingly popular with empty-nesters, the large number of new active-adult developments for people over age 55 helped produce a 40 percent increase in homes for sale. The number of sales contracts, meanwhile, rose by 25 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only Camden and Gloucester Counties in the southern part of the state showed no increase in number of home sales, although both had increases of 15 percent or more in inventory.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In certain towns, the supply and demand dynamic was very pronounced: In Bloomfield, in Essex County, the Otteau group's numbers showed a steep and steady climb in listings and a sharp 20 percent decline in number of sales during May and June. And in nearby Nutley, the number of listings spiked and the number of sales plummeted.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in neighboring Glen Ridge, both the number of new listings and signed contracts dipped in May and rose in June.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Otteau group works with numbers of signed contracts rather than with completed sales in producing its market research because that provides more timely information, even if it is slightly less reliable, since some contracted sales might fall through.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Otteau and the brokers who pay for his services say the lag time between signed contracts and closings is often too long to provide an accurate picture of what is happening on the market right now.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Otteau report is based on data supplied by various local Boards of Realtors and multiple-listing groups.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hartz to Hold Meetings On Ford Site  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last May, Ford announced that its 56-year-old assembly plant on Route 1 in Edison had been sold and would be razed to make way for a proposed ''lifestyle center'' -- including entertainment, retail, office and residential buildings, to be developed by Hartz Mountain Industries.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hartz, meanwhile, announced that it would be mindful of the huge changes the project would bring to Edison, and pledged no redevelopment work would begin until after the company met with local business owners and residents.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hartz, based in Secaucus, has scheduled the first in what is to be a series of open town-hall-style meetings for Thursday at 7 p.m., at the Edison Clarion Inn.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, the company also started a Web site at hartzedison.com for comments, proposals, questions and suggestions. Hartz's evolving plans for the Ford site will be updated frequently on the site, company officials said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hartz, the operator of five New Jersey malls and the builder of much of the modern Journal Square in Jersey City, is stressing the importance of community input out of a recognition that civic-minded residents have strong feelings about the plant, which operated continuously for more than half a century as a major employer in town, said Hartz's president, Emanuel Stern.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A major, established town like Edison and a site as complex as the Ford property require that we do everything we can to understand the project through the eyes of local residents and community organizations,'' Mr. Stern said. ''We are committed to using an array of communication tools that allow the public to interact with us frequently and in their preferred manner, whether that be in writing, through local leaders, or in person.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ford has only begun the process of demolition at the site. It is also working on environmental cleanup, according to a plan approved by the state's Department of Environmental Protection. The automaker is expected to turn over the Edison site to Hartz by the end of the year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hartz's bid to develop the Meadowlands Continental Arena site into a mixed-use entertainment complex was denied earlier this year -- a decision that Hartz continues to appeal in court.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, on Route 27 in Edison, more big changes are poised to occur: The former world headquarters of Revlon, the cosmetics giant, also awaits redevelopment as a mixed-use project, by NAI Hanson of Hackensack, a large real estate development firm.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">VERNON W. HILL II, the founder and chief executive of <span class="companylink">Commerce Bancorp Inc</span>., credits his ''wow the customer'' philosophy for taking his company from a little-known local institution in southern New Jersey to the fastest-growing retail bank in the nation. By keeping branches open weekends and evenings and by eliminating what he calls the ''annoying fees'' and ''stupid rules'' found at other banks, Mr. Hill has flouted industry convention. And with a stock price that is up 135 percent in the past five years, he has elicited more than a few wows from Wall Street, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, however, Mr. Hill, a former real estate executive and owner of fast-food franchises, can hear a different sort of wow from shareholders -- one of shock. They recently learned that two of the bank's top executives and one of its former directors are embroiled in an influence-peddling scandal in Philadelphia. An indictment announced on June 29 by the United States attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania named 12 individuals in a pay-to-play arrangement involving Corey Kemp, Philadelphia's former treasurer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the indictment, Mr. Kemp handed out the city's money management and bond underwriting business to financial institutions that entertained him with restaurant meals and tickets to sporting events and that gave him sizable loans despite his abysmal credit rating. Among those indicted were Glenn K. Holck, president of Commerce Bank's Pennsylvania unit, and Stephen M. Umbrell, its regional vice president. At the heart of the scheme, the indictment says, was Ronald A. White, a lawyer who sat on a Commerce regional board until last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps ominously for Commerce, the indictment refers to five phone conversations taped by investigators in which Mr. Hill discussed matters relating to Mr. Kemp with the individuals named in the indictment. In an interview on Friday, Mr. Hill declined to describe the nature of the conversations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kemp, Mr. White, Mr. Umbrell and Mr. Holck have all pleaded not guilty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commerce says that the bank and its executives did nothing wrong. While Mr. Holck and Mr. Umbrell have been suspended, the bank is paying their legal expenses. In a July 13 conference call with analysts to discuss second-quarter results, Mr. Hill promised to institute new policies to increase oversight of the bank's dealings with government officials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Bad things happen to good firms, and this Philadelphia incident is a reflection of the climate we're in,'' Mr. Hill said on Friday. ''But it doesn't detract from the customer value we've added in every market.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawyers for Mr. Holck and Mr. Umbrell said that their clients would not be available to comment for this article. They said, however, that both men would vigorously fight the charges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all of Mr. Hill's assurances and bullish reports on Commerce from several Wall Street analysts, the bank's shares have fallen almost 9 percent since the conference call, indicating that investors fear other problems may lurk in Commerce's operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THEIR fears may be justified. Although Michael Critchley, the lawyer who oversaw Commerce's internal investigation into the activities of Mr. Holck and Mr. Umbrell, told analysts that the government had concluded its investigation and that neither the bank nor any of its other officers or employees would be charged with wrongdoing, the United States attorney filed documents in the case in federal court in Philadelphia on July 19 stating that Commerce ''remains a subject of ongoing criminal and civil investigations.'' Mr. Critchley, a lawyer in West Orange, N.J., is a director of Commerce's regional board for northern New Jersey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hill played down the investigation and said that the bank is a subject, not a target. ''Anybody's name who comes up in an investigation is a subject,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Lewis D. Lowenfels, a lawyer at Tolins &amp; Lowenfels in New York, said that does not necessarily provide comfort. ''According to the United States attorney's manual,'' he said, ''a subject of an investigation is a person or entity whose conduct is within the scope of the grand jury's investigation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also weighing on the stock is an informal inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission disclosed by Commerce last fall; neither the commission nor the company has said what that investigation involves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hill has said that Commerce's service-oriented approach represents the future of banking. But to scrutinize the company's financial statements and practices is to be transported back in time to the days before Enron and WorldCom collapsed, leading to a wave of corporate reforms. Indeed, payments that Commerce made to entities controlled by Mr. Hill and his family -- for everything from interior design to real estate consulting -- give the operation the appearance of a piggy bank for insiders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hill defended the bank's practices as appropriate in all cases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Adam Barkstrom, an analyst at <span class="companylink">Legg Mason</span> who has been bearish on Commerce shares for two years, is urging investors to sell the stock in part because of the risk that additional investigations or charges may emerge. ''The ongoing headline risk is a significant issue, and I think the market shares that sentiment,'' he said. ''I think it was a little premature for Commerce on their conference call to try to present the message that there would be no further investigation,'' when the July 19 filing by the United States attorney ''seems to point to the contrary.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Barkstrom, a former federal bank examiner, also finds Commerce to be far less profitable than its competitors. For example, the bank's capital expenditures are stratospheric, he said, and its net income per employee is a very low $25,000; the comparable figure at <span class="companylink">North Fork Bancorp</span>, another fast-growing regional bank in the Northeast, is $135,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Corporate governance issues aside, from our perspective looking at the Commerce model, they do a lot of things that are very compelling,'' Mr. Barkstrom said. ''Their deposit growth has been very strong. But at what cost? The cost is reflected in the performance of the company, and we have never viewed Commerce as a high-performance bank.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the mess in Philadelphia, however, Commerce Bank had been on a tear. Founded in 1973, its deposits have grown by an average of 39 percent a year over the last five years; assets rose 38 percent last year, to $22.7 billion. Revenues jumped 31 percent last year, to $1 billion, and net income increased 34 percent, to almost $200 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hill said that the bank's profitability was excellent, and noted that return on shareholders' equity was up almost 20 percent in the most recent quarter. ''We believe the numbers shareholders care about are return on capital and growth rates,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">America's most convenient bank, as Commerce calls itself, operates almost 300 branches. It is ubiquitous in New Jersey and is on its way to becoming so in metropolitan New York, where it opened 34 branches last year and has plans for 40 more this year. Commerce also intends to crack the Washington market by opening as many as 15 branches there in 2005. Its chain-store concept offers free A.T.M.'s, free checking and branches that are open seven days a week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hill basks in the bank's success. Each year, he presides over the bank's ''Wow!'' awards, dispensing prizes to employees for the best part-time teller and other categories. Last year, Commerce rented out Radio City Music Hall for the awards party, which featured appearances by the Rockettes and the actress Julia Louis-Dreyfus. Mr. Hill is not reluctant to lavish money on himself, either: he recently finished building a home in Moorestown, N.J., that is reportedly 45,000 square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides its retail business, Commerce also serves governments and corporations. In recent years, it has been the largest underwriter of municipal bonds in New Jersey. But last month, as a result of the Philadelphia scandal, Mr. Hill announced that the bank would only underwrite such bonds if they were put up for competitive bid. Municipal deposits account for 17 percent of the company's total deposits, far more than the industry average, and made up almost one-quarter of Commerce's growth in deposits over the last year. In addition, the bank offers insurance brokerage services to corporate and government clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Commerce also does quite a bit of business with its own executives, directors and other insiders. For example, the bank and its subsidiaries had loans out to various executives and directors totaling $145.7 million last year. In 2002, such loans totaled $124.8 million; the year before, they were $70 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commerce said these loans were appropriate because they were made in the ordinary course of business and on substantially the same terms as arm's-length transactions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THEN there are the millions of dollars paid by Commerce to InterArch Inc., an architectural and interior design firm owned by Mr. Hill's wife, Shirley. Last year, InterArch received $6.4 million for design services and $3.8 million for project management on furniture and building purchases made by Commerce. These payments have risen every year recently; since 2000, they have totaled $26.1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company said that the payments are ''substantially equivalent'' to those it would pay to an unaffiliated company, and that the Commerce board believes the arrangement with InterArch has been ''an important factor in the success of the Commerce brand.'' But Mr. Hill said that the project management business previously run by Mrs. Hill was now being run out of Commerce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate partnerships in which Mr. Hill is an investor also receive millions of dollars annually from Commerce in rents -- approximately $2 million last year, or almost 6 percent of the total rent expense charged to the bank under its operating leases in the period. Since 2000, these partnerships have received almost $7 million in rents from Commerce. According to the bank, the rents are supported by independent appraisals and approved by the independent members of its board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2002, to eliminate the appearance of conflict, Mr. Hill agreed not to participate in any future real estate leasing transactions involving Commerce. But the bank's real estate ties to Mr. Hill and his family don't end with its rent payments. His son, Vernon W. Hill III, earns brokerage commissions as an executive at Site Development Inc., a private company that Commerce uses to locate properties for new branches. Site Development was founded by Mr. Hill in 1968, but he said he was no longer involved in its operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, Commerce bank shareholders pay for the company's use of Galloway National Golf Club in Galloway, N.J., owned by Mr. Hill. Last year, these payments totaled $448,000, down slightly from the $451,000 the bank paid the club in 2002.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All this largess comes on top of a handsome pay package for Mr. Hill: last year, he received $3 million in salary and bonus, $205,325 in other compensation and 150,000 stock options.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What does Commerce's board think of all this? The bank's S.E.C. filings note that its board approves all the transactions with affiliated companies. One committee of the board develops proper governance policies; it is headed by Jack R. Bershad, 74, a retired partner at Blank Rome, a Philadelphia law firm. Joseph T. Tarquini Jr., 69, a director of Commerce's New Jersey unit since 1973 and former chairman of an architectural firm, is on the three-member committee and, until the end of last year, so was Frank C. Videon Sr., owner of a funeral home in Broomall, Pa. Mr. Video turned 80 last year and resigned from the board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to its most recent proxy, Commerce's audit committee has a similar makeup. Its chairman is Daniel J. Ragone, 77, a former chairman of a Haddonfield, N.J., accounting firm; he was joined last year on the audit committee by Mr. Tarquini, the architect, and Mr. Videon, the funeral home owner. Mr. Bershad declined to comment, and the other directors did not return phone calls seeking comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hill said he was proud of his directors: ''This is the board that has produced the highest shareholder return in America over the last 10 years.'' Still, he added that the board would probably change to reflect the fact that Commerce is now a major regional bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Insider dealings at Commerce go beyond its transactions with Mr. Hill and his family. The bank also played an intriguing role in the merger of <span class="companylink">U.S. Vision</span>, an eyeglass retailer, with a group of investors that included George E. Norcross III, chief executive of Commerce's Insurance Services subsidiary and a Commerce director; and William A. Schwartz, chief executive of <span class="companylink">U.S. Vision</span>, who also sat on the Commerce board. Mr. Norcross's investor group owned 27 percent of <span class="companylink">U.S. Vision</span> at the time of the merger, and Mr. Schwartz owned 3.6 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buyout occurred in the fall of 2002 and paid shareholders $4.25 a share, a premium of about 25 percent at the time. In urging shareholders to approve the deal, <span class="companylink">U.S. Vision</span>'s board noted that the financial adviser it had hired had concluded that the merger was fair to stockholders. That adviser was none other than <span class="companylink">Commerce Capital Markets Inc</span>. Furthermore, Commerce provided the funding for the acquisition with a $17.5 million line of credit and a new $15 million term loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everything we did was completely appropriate,'' Mr. Hill said. ''Do you think that the major banks in this country do not do banking and investment banking with members of their boards?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Considering the Philadelphia indictment and its charges of government corruption, what's perhaps most notable about Commerce is the number of former politicians who are associated with it. For example, Douglas J. Pauls, the bank's chief financial officer, was chief financial officer for Camden County in New Jersey before he joined Commerce in 1994.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to its annual report, three <span class="companylink">Commerce Bancorp</span> directors are former politicians, including Mr. Norcross, who is former chairman of the Camden County Democratic Committee. Mr. Norcross ranks second on PoliticsNJ.com's list of top 100 insiders who influence politics in New Jersey. Mr. Hill, the bank's founder, is No.41 on the list.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Donald T. DiFrancesco, a Commerce director since 2002, was the acting governor of New Jersey from early 2001 to early 2002 and president of the state's Senate from 1992 to 2001. And Joseph E. Buckelew, a Commerce director since 1996, is a former chairman both of the Republican Party in Ocean County, N.J., and of the New Jersey Highway Authority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The political connections extend to Commerce's regional boards. John A. Lynch, a director of the board for central New Jersey, is a Democratic Party leader and former Senate president who ranks No.4 on the Web site's list. Another director of the central New Jersey board, Dale Florio, is a lobbyist and the chairman of the Republican Party in Somerset County. Mr. Florio, who is no relation to Jim Florio, the former governor, ranks as the 70th most powerful political insider in the state, according to the Web site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Henry Topel, a director on Commerce's regional board in Delaware, is a former state chairman of the Democratic Party, and Charles P. Sexton Jr., a member of Commerce's Pennsylvania regional board, was the Republican Party chairman in Springfield, Pa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Banks all have politically active people on their boards; what is the big deal?'' Mr. Hill said. ''I see Robert Rubin is on the board of <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span>.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given Commerce's interest in attracting deposits from municipalities, it may not be surprising that the bank would try to capitalize on political ties. But just how far the bank goes to gain such deposits is the question. And the indictment out of Philadelphia gives some disturbing answers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kemp, the former city treasurer at the center of the scandal, resigned last November. But back in December 2002, he was interested in buying a home in Birdsboro, Pa., prosecutors said. He had extensive credit problems, however, including $13,000 owed to a bank that had repossessed his 1997 Mitsubishi Montero and another $20,000 in delinquent credit and loan accounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Less than a year earlier, before he became city treasurer, Mr. Kemp had applied for a $2,000 line of credit from Commerce. That application was rejected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in late 2002, the bank gave him loans of $225,489, which financed 100 percent of the new home's purchase price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the loan was made, an officer in Commerce's consumer loan department advised a senior lender that Mr. Kemp's loan was not one he wanted in the bank's portfolio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the indictment, the loan officer described the credit scores for Mr. Kemp and his wife as ''among the lowest scores he had seen in his 40-year banking career.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The employee was overruled by Mr. Umbrell, the indictment said, who told lending officials that they ''needed to make this happen.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN mid-2003, prosecutors said, Commerce also provided a $480,000 construction loan for a church where Mr. Kemp served as a trustee. Bank officials allowed Mr. Kemp and an associate to receive approximately $115,000 in loan proceeds for expenses that church officials said had been paid but that had not been verified by the bank. An employee of Commerce, the indictment said, made this note in the loan file: ''I did what I was told to do.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July 2003, Commerce also made an unsecured loan to Mr. Kemp's brother-in-law, whose loan application at another bank had recently been rejected. Mr. Kemp told Mr. Umbrell that his brother-in-law had ''a little shaky credit,'' according to the indictment. But Mr. Umbrell replied: ''What do you want to go back and promise him? I am trying to make you look good; if you want to tell him $7,500, tell him $7,500.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first, bank officials rejected the loan application. But they were overruled by Mr. Umbrell, prosecutors said. The bank listed the loan as having financed a personal vacation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For his part, Mr. Kemp gave Commerce lead roles in bond underwritings and arranged for Philadelphia to deposit some of its cash at the bank. In 2003, the bank won an assignment to manage part of the city's $500 million in cash; later that year, Commerce received deposits of $52.5 million, the indictment said, including some that were withdrawn from a competitor. In addition, spurning the advice of city lawyers, Mr. Kemp arranged for Commerce to both consult for the treasurer's office and receive contracts from it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On July 1, 2003, according to the indictment, Mr. Kemp told an associate that Commerce had better take care of him, because ''I am hooking them up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ONE year later, Mr. Kemp is no longer Philadelphia's treasurer, and Mr. Umbrell and Mr. Holck have been suspended from Commerce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kevin Marino, Mr. Holck's lawyer, argues that every loan his client made to Mr. Kemp was appropriate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I am confident that when these facts are placed before the jury, they will categorically reject the government's allegation that Glenn Holck engaged in improper acts,'' Mr. Marino said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Mr. Hill told analysts during his second-quarter conference call, Commerce has hired an independent law firm to review the bank's policies. ''Our goal is to have the industry-leading, gold-standard policy on how you deal with government officials,'' Mr. Hill said. ''As we continue to grow this company at a 40 percent rate year after year, I and all of our management team have to be totally committed to world-class risk control. And we pledge that's what we're going to do.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Commerce Bancorp</span> shareholders had better hope he succeeds.</p>
