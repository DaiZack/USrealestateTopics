<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Reports released Wednesday offered a mixed review of the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first report, construction spending fell more than expected in May, a sign the problems facing the nation's builders are far from over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said construction spendingdropped 0.9 percent last month, nearly double the 0.5 percent drop that economists expected. Adding to the signs of weakness, activity in the last two months was revised lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction rose 0.6 percent in April, lower than the 0.8 percent originally reported. A March increase of 0.4 percent was replaced with a decline of the same amount.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For May, the only strength came in nonresidential activity. Residential construction dropped sharply, and spending on federal, state and local projects also declined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential building fell 3.4 percent after a flat reading the month before. Spending on private home building dropped 33.9 percent from a year ago amid the steepest slump in housing in decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonresidential construction rose 0.5 percent with spending on transportation, power projects and manufacturing all growing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total public construction dropped 0.6 percent, the biggest decline since a 1.7 percent fall in January. Spending on federal projects fell 0.3 percent, while spending on state and local projects dropped 0.7 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the housing sector, pending home sales rose in May for a fourth month, spurred by low prices and a first-time homebuyers tax credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said Wednesday that its seasonally adjusted index of pending sales increased by 0.1 percent in May to 90.7. Analysts expected no change, according to Thomson Reuters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the increase was small, it followed a 7.1 percent jump in the index in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The pronounced increase in April and the fact that May sustained this rise does indicate that actual existing home sales are poised to rise in the coming month or two,'' said Joshua Shapiro, chief economist for economic forecasting firm MFR Inc., in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index, which tracks signed contracts to purchase previously occupied homes, is considered a barometer for future home sales. Typically there is a one- to two- month lag between a sales contract and a completed deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index is 6.7 percent higher than in May 2008, when it was 85. The last time it increased for four consecutive months was in October 2004, the Realtor association said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report on manufacturing activity showed that the sector contracted less than expected in June, and at the slowest pace since last August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management, a trade group of purchasing executives, said its manufacturing index read 44.8 in June. That is up from 42.8 in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A reading below 50 indicates contraction. June's reading marks the 17th consecutive month of deterioration in manufacturing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, last month's tally was better than expected as analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected the index to rise to 44.5.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The manufacturing index includes new orders, production, employment, inventories, prices, and export and import orders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A reading below 50 indicates contraction. June's reading marks the 17th straight month of deterioration in manufacturing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, there is an encouraging pattern in recent manufacturing reports. This is the second month that the index has been above 41.2 after seven consecutive declines. The group says a reading above that level is consistent with expansion in the overall economy -- even though the manufacturing sector itself is still shrinking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also on Thursday, the ADP National Employment Report said that private sector employment fell by 473,000 in June. That was less than the 532,000 jobs shed in May.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Sharp Price Drops Found In Manhattan Apartments</span>
</div><div class="author">By JOSH BARBANEL   </div><div>838 words</div><div>2 July 2009</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>16</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan apartment prices fell sharply during the second quarter of 2009, as the limited number of deals struck during the darkest months of the economic downturn began to close, according to a series of market reports released Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of closings fell more than 50 percent, and prices in some categories were reported down as much as 25 percent, compared with the same quarter in 2008. Sale prices were also down from those reported in the first quarter of 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One report, by Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead Property, put the average price of a Manhattan apartment in the second quarter at $1.26 million, a decline of 24 percent from the same period in 2008, and 16 percent below the previous quarter. It put the median sale price at $795,000, 19 percent below the figure in the first quarter of 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another report, by Prudential Douglas Elliman, found that the median sale price on the resale of existing apartments was down by 25.6 percent from a year earlier. The report, prepared by Jonathan J. Miller, president of Miller Samuel Inc., an appraisal firm, said that the number of sales was down 50.3 percent compared with the same period in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new figures on closed sales confirm the downward trajectory in the Manhattan market that brokers have been reporting for many months. But the report was issued at a time when brokers had begun to say that sales activity rebounded sharply in the last six weeks, though at prices well below the peak last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The market took a nose dive and business virtually stopped in September,'' said Dorothy Herman, the president of Prudential Douglas Elliman. ''Now you are seeing people at least spending money again. I am not saying it is a different world; buyers are still looking for value.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reports issued by the major brokerage firms show that the steepest declines in sales and prices occurred in the largest and most expensive apartments, where banks are requiring large down payments from buyers seeking mortgages. Sales were also off sharply in new condominium developments, which have been hit hard in the economic downturn. Mr. Miller put the decline in sales of new condos at 61.7 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strongest activity was reported in smaller, less expensive apartments, often bought by renters buying their first homes. They benefited by low mortgage rates available for loans that conform to federal guidelines, and a federal tax credit available to many first-time home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lag in time between the time a contract is signed and the time a deal closes is unusually long in Manhattan because many sales cannot close until a buyer is approved by a co-op board, or a sale is reviewed by a condominium board. Many of the sales reported in contract in the last few weeks will not close until later in the summer or the fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Brown Harris Stevens report found that sales of trophy apartments had shriveled during the downturn, with sales of co-ops costing more than $10 million off by 82 percent from the same period a year ago. This contributed to a sharp weakening in average prices of all co-ops, off 29 percent to $918,795, the report found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But sales of these larger co-ops have picked up along with the rest of the market. ''As 2009 has progressed we have continued to see a significant increase in activity and sales each month,'' said Hall F. Willkie, president of Brown Harris Stevens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A number of statistics supported this view. The inventory of apartments on the market, and the number of days an apartment lingered on the market before it sold, were up sharply from a year ago, but down a bit from the first quarter as the market strengthened. Streeteasy.com, a real estate Web site, said that 2,477 apartments went into contract during the second quarter, an 82 percent increase from activity in the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, there was very little optimism that sale prices would strengthen significantly from their current level. Pamela Liebman, the chief executive at <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, said she expected prices to stabilize and then perhaps rise ''a couple of points'' a year. Sellers are better off selling now than waiting, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If I were a seller, I would take the risk out of the calculation,'' she said. ''Time does not necessarily equate to money here for the seller.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miller said that at best, the market would move sideways. ''We will probably get a little worse before it is going to get better,'' he said, ''because unemployment is likely to continue to rise after the recession ends this year.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Gregory J. Heym, the chief economist for Halstead and Brown Harris Stevens, said the economic outlook in New York had improved, with unemployment, so far, remaining below the national rate. ''A lot of things are bottoming out,'' he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There have been bad housing markets before, but never in post-World War II history has the market for new homes suffered as badly as it has in this decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That plunge raises questions about whether some homes built during the boom will ever be sold. It could also suggest that home builders have been slow to cut their prices enough to keep up with falling market prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For more than three decades, the sales volume of existing single-family homes and newly built houses tended to rise and fall by about the same percentage, as can be seen in the accompanying charts. To be sure, sales of new homes did tend to do a little worse during recessions, but the difference was small and short-lived.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The top chart shows sales volumes of both types of homes, compared with the sales pace for each in 1976. To avoid monthly gyrations caused by weather or other temporary factors, the figures use three-month moving averages of seasonally adjusted annual rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the peak of the housing boom in 2005, sales of both existing and new homes were running at twice the 1976 rate. This year, the sales rate for existing homes seems to have stabilized at about one-third higher than the 1976 rate. New-home sales also seem to have stabilized, but at about half the 1976 rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second chart reflects the same data, but shows how far sales fell from peak levels during each downturn in the past. The plunge in sales of existing homes is severe but not unprecedented. But new-home sales are now running at only about a quarter of peak levels, a fall far deeper than anything seen since the statistics began being collected in the 1960s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home prices, while they have fallen sharply, do not appear to have declined as far as prices of existing homes. At the worst point this year, the median price of existing homes was off 29 percent from the peak, while the largest drop for new-home prices was 23 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median home price figures need to be used with caution, since there is no way to know how the median home sold in one month compares, in terms of size and location, to the median home sold in a different month. But in past recessions, new-home prices have tended to be weaker than existing-home prices, the opposite of what has happened in this cycle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Foreclosed homes are the supply that has to be worked off,'' said Robert Barbera, the chief economist of ITG, an investment advisory firm. He said the problem had worsened in recent months after the end of the foreclosure moratorium adopted by many lenders while they waited to see what the Obama administration would propose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the 135,000 completed but unsold new homes at the end of May, nearly half had been sitting for a year or more. The median age of such homes was 11.5 months, an unprecedented figure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It may be that builders will have to cut prices even more to sell some houses -- houses that, in retrospect, probably should never have been built at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CHART: In a Bad Housing Market, New-Home Sales Suffer Most: Sales of new and existing homes normally rise and fall by about the same proportion, although new sales lag a little during recessions. But in this recession, new sales have fallen far more than sales of existing homes. One result is that the median age of completed, but unsold, new homes is now approaching one year.(Sources: National Association of Realtors (existing sales) and Census Bureau (new sales), both via Haver Analytics)</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article on June 16 about investors returning to the British commercial property market referred incorrectly to statistics on sales declines compiled by the real estate adviser DTZ. The figures -- which included a 75 percent drop from the market's peak in Britain, 89 percent in the United States and 80 percent in the Asia Pacific region -- referred to the value of all transactions, not to the prices paid.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN her job as a real estate agent at William Pitt <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> in Darien, Conn., Ellen Kelley sees a lot of homes. So many, in fact, that they tend to blur together. But several years ago, she visited one she can't seem to forget. ''I almost expected Donna Reed to come to the door,'' Ms. Kelley said, recalling the colonial-style house. ''It was a classic 1940s. The appliances were still intact, it was meticulously maintained, everything was ... frozen.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, a time capsule -- one of those homes that have gone untouched for decades and give visitors the sensation of being in a decor-warp. In the wake of the last decade's renovation boom, when home equity lines were easy to obtain and house-flipping became almost commonplace, such homes have become increasingly rare. But some homeowners -- despite years of residence and the seemingly ubiquitous influence of home-improvement TV shows -- have managed to resist the urge to replace the yellow Formica counters or even buy a new couch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why a home remains stuck in the past is unclear. In some cases, the owners may have lacked the money or the desire to update; in others, they may have found a style they liked and seen no reason to change. Or a home may have become a memorial -- albeit an unconscious one -- to an earlier period in their lives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Lots of people become frozen to a time in their past,'' said Gail Thoen, a psychologist who has done research on aging. The breakup of a marriage or the death of a spouse are two of the most common reasons people hang on to a particular time, she said, which is sometimes reflected in their environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leon Hoffman, a psychoanalyst in Manhattan, said a house can provide a ''secure base'' -- a bulwark against change. ''Some people are more stuck in their ways,'' Dr. Hoffman explained. ''There's a bit of anxiety about what the new stuff brings.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Identifying exactly when a home became stuck is easier. ''Pink-tile bathrooms, Dishmaster faucets, colors like aquamarine and sunbeam yellow -- all very 1950s,'' said Pam Kueber, who runs retrorenovation.com, a Web site devoted to midcentury design. Shag carpet and avocado appliances indicate the '70s. Lava rock and ultrasuede? As '80s as a Rubik's Cube.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Kueber posts midcentury time capsules on her site, with photos provided by readers, often taken from real estate listings. In many cases, she said, the homes were occupied by elderly couples who were immensely proud of them. ''I think the owners of these homes were tremendously invested in them emotionally, as well as financially,'' she said. ''They came from an era where a house was very hard won.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a rule, she said, the homes were well cared for, and the belief was ''Why change something if it's not worn out?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ray Schuldenfrei, a veteran real estate agent in Los Angeles who used to see preserved midcentury homes so often he became an expert on mosaic tile motifs of the 1950s (cactus was popular), said he thinks ''we're right at the cusp'' of a decor extinction, as the World War II generation leaves many of these older homes, through downsizing or death. ''With rare exceptions, unless the house is a classic, new owners usually gut and change,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least they did until recently. With credit tight and mortgage-strapped Americans bunkering down, there may be a new generation of time capsules in the making, with garage-size family rooms and stainless steel appliances the early 21st-century equivalents of the conversation pit and the avocado refrigerator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, there are still more than a few 20th-century time capsules around. Each of the following homes reflects a particular decade and aesthetic, from the 1950s to the 1980s, some of them once on the cutting edge of design. Why didn't their owners keep up with the trends? The reasons are as varied as the spaces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1950: Dedicated Modernists</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, the floating glass house that Donald E. Olsen, an architect, built in 1954 as his family residence on a sloping lot in Berkeley, Calif., became a city landmark, heralded as a brilliant example of modernism. The designation means Mr. Olsen and his wife, Helen, cannot significantly alter the home without permission -- a directive they will have little trouble following, if their living area is any indication.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The couch is George Nelson, and that was bought in 1955,'' Ms. Olsen said by phone the other day. ''The leather chairs we purchased when we were in Switzerland. That was in 1953.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The midcentury theme continues: a pair of Wassily chairs; two Mies van der Rohe MR chairs; a 20-foot-tall painting by the artist Claire Falkenstein. Each piece reflects the home's modern aesthetic, a style the Olsens have been committed to for most of their lives. (Mr. Olsen, 89, studied under Walter Gropius at Harvard; Ms. Olsen, who is of a similar age, but declined to be more specific, was a graphic designer).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There have been a few changes over the years. The George Nelson couch was recovered in the '60s, and the Formica counters were replaced with marble a few years later. With each passing decade, the panorama of downtown Oakland and the Golden Gate Bridge disappeared behind the thickening redwoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond that, though, the elegant steel-and-glass house looks much as it did when the couple took up residence in the mid-'50s. ''Things don't change -- they get added to,'' Ms. Olsen said, referring to family photos or artwork on the walls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When asked why she never replaced the furniture, she explained, ''I picked it carefully, and love every bit of it. They are works of art.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her husband agreed: ''These pieces are much superior to anything you can find now and, as far as I'm concerned, thoroughly modern.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, the living room does resemble a <span class="companylink">Design Within Reach</span> showroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Did Mr. Olsen ever want to alter his creation as technology and his bank balance improved?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Being an architect, of course all kinds of things come to mind,'' he said. ''But I think as the years go by, this home has become more satisfying than I even first imagined.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1960: Why Alter a Masterpiece?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like much of the furniture in Alice Atkins's home in Livingston, N.J., the two-tiered white living-room coffee table has been there for decades, which might suggest she likes it. In fact, that's not the case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''To be honest, I'm not in love with it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So why didn't she find a replacement over the years?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't know. Why didn't I, Steve?'' Ms. Atkins, 82, asked her husband, S. Stephen Atkins, 84.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was in no mood to refurnish,'' he replied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His tone was playful, but as the two spoke about their ranch-style house, it became clear why little more than the calendars have changed since the '60s. Mr. Atkins, now a semi-retired builder specializing in medical offices, worked with an architect to design the house, creating richly wooded surfaces and built-ins in the manner of Frank Lloyd Wright.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We were told that for this area it was way ahead of its time,'' he said. ''People who saw it thought, 'Oh, my Lord. This is California.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Atkins believes he got it right the first time. ''The things we did, you couldn't do in today's world -- the cost would be astronomical,'' he said, citing the walnut, cherry and ash paneling and the curved wall he had his men build in the entry, laboriously wetting and bending the pieces of wall board into shape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In furnishing the home, Ms. Atkins said she worked with a local decorator who took her to top furniture showrooms in Manhattan. Many elements evoke classic '60s design, like the brass wall hangings in the living room, the white plastic dinette table and the Japanese-themed entry wall. Aside from the coffee table, she said, she is still pleased with the decor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not long ago Mr. Atkins mentioned selling the house. ''My wife won't even consider it,'' he said. ''She doesn't want to live in any other house.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1970: It's Contemporary to Him, Anyway</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Jason Reitzin's home in Encino, Calif., features all the hallmarks of upscale '70s design -- walnut paneling; glass-and-chrome dining table; black lacquer console -- its provenance harks back to the previous decade. ''It was built by Basil Grillo, who was Bing Crosby's manager,'' Mr. Reitzin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its current incarnation dates from 1974, when Mr. Reitzin and his wife, Lillian, bught the home, relocating from Bel-Air. ''We had a good decorator come up, Sally Sirkin,'' he said, referring to the designer Sally Sirkin Lewis. According to Mr. Reitzin, she transformed what had been a ''bland'' interior into something more stylish, introducing elements like an Italian glass table in the living room and suggesting he dye the beige-gold bedroom carpets to match the color scheme in the living areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shown photographs of the home recently, Ms. Sirkin Lewis said she had no memory of the project, but acknowledged that the sofas resemble those of J. Robert Scott, her furniture line, and the animal tusks mounted in Lucite cubes on the coffee table were something she did in those days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Sirkin Lewis's style has since progressed, but Mr. Reitzin said his home still feels ''contemporary'' to him. Retired as an executive for Allway Tools, he said he carefully maintained the house, one reason he thought alterations were unnecessary. (Although now that he and his wife are 79, and she is in poor health, he plans to sell the house in the next few years and downsize.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is an additional motivation for making sure everything looked just as it did when Nixon was in office: Mr. Reitzin rents the house as a period setting for film and TV shoots like ''Charlie's Angels.'' The '70s original, in fact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1980: Cutting Edge, Again</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard and Barbara Rubens own an interior design firm, Messardiere Design Quest, that prides itself on being modern. In the 1970s, as Tomorrow Designs, they popularized the mirror trend, and worked on the interior of the Manhattan disco Regine's. Even today, Ms. Rubens said, ''We love to be right there on the edge of design.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the couple's 3,000-square-foot triplex town house in Riverdale, in the Bronx, is totally cutting edge -- circa 1984.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The kitchen cabinets are all-black polyester lacquer and the countertops are black granite; the toilet is from Kohler's Pillow Talk line, introduced in the 1980s. In the living room, a black leather Thayer Coggin sectional curves around a black coffee table. Upstairs in the master bedroom, a platform bed upholstered in ultrasuede faces a mirrored wall unit. The feeling is bold, stark, masculine and sexy -- like the bachelor pad of a Reagan-era stockbroker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When we did it, it was very up to date,'' Ms. Rubens said. ''Black was very in. Curves were very in.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So how did two forward-thinking designers come to live in a time warp? ''It's a husband-and-wife business, and husband and wife can't agree,'' Ms. Rubens explained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not difficult to see where the battle lines are drawn. Sitting on the couch one evening recently, Mr. Rubens, who sports a 1980s shag hairdo, looked like a man content with his surroundings, although he insisted that he's willing to renovate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He would like to keep it black,'' Ms. Rubens said. ''He feels it's ridiculous to smash out all of that lacquer'' in the kitchen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Updating specific areas would be the practical thing to do, she conceded, but she would prefer a complete overhaul --all in white. ''I am very stubborn,'' she said. ''I want all-white or nothing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As it happens, the couple, who are both in their mid-50s, already have an all-white house in the Hamptons (Casa Blanca, they call it), and the fact that they are often there or traveling has allowed the argument over the Riverdale town house to simmer for years.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- A real estate group, the National Association of Realtors, said on Tuesday that sales of previously occupied homes rose modestly from April to May, the third monthly increase this year, but that signs of any housing recovery were fragile at best.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors said that home sales rose 2.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.77 million last month, from a downwardly revised pace of 4.66 million in April. Prices, meanwhile, were 16.8 percent lower than a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About one out of every three homes sold was a foreclosure or distressed sale. That helped drag down the median price to $173,000 -- 16.8 percent below a year ago. Falling prices coupled with new rules for property appraisers have caused many transactions to fall apart or be delayed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have just been flooded with e-mails, telephone calls on the appraisal problems,'' said Lawrence Yun, the Realtors' chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales results missed economists' expectations, and stock markets headed lower on the news. Home sales had been expected to rise to an annual pace of 4.81 million units, according to Thomson Reuters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One bright spot, however, was that the number of unsold homes on the market at the end of May fell 3.5 percent, to nearly 3.8 million. That is a 9.6-month supply at the current sales pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That drop was ''the best news in the report,'' said Joseph LaVorgna, <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>'s chief economist.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate investment trusts have long been touted as good portfolio diversifiers because they typically don't move in lock step with other financial markets. But REITs have hardly been impervious to the recent debacle on Wall Street. By early March, returns on property-owning REITs had plunged an average of 75 percent from their peak in February 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as the broader stock market has been slowly recovering, so, too, have REIT shares. Many REITs have already made up a chunk of their losses -- from March 6 to May 5 alone, overall returns shot up 55 percent, according to the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts -- and the market may be poised to post some modest gains in the second half of 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trade association's index of equity REITs, which own property and constitute the bulk of the market, was up nearly 27 percent from April 1 through Thursday, though it was off 13.5 percent for the year to date, with some property sectors in positive territory. Among the top categories this year were lodging, up 3 percent; manufactured homes, up 2.5 percent; and free-standing retail stores, up 0.03 percent. (The battered mortgage sector was off 1.5 percent, on average, with home-financing REITs up an average of 0.73 percent.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Does this mean that the worst may be over for the REIT market?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some in the industry seem to think so. ''We believe that we have seen a market bottom and a rebound from that bottom,'' said Brad Case, the association's vice president of research and industry information.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though he sees a bumpy recovery ahead, Mr. Case says that publicly traded REITs are projected to lead the rebound in commercial real estate, in part because they have the ability to raise money by selling securities, an option not available to credit-starved private firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''REITs are likely to use access to the equity markets to pay down debt; then they will be in a position to acquire new assets later on,'' he said. ''Deleveraging is the theme for 2009.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Debt levels for REITs have typically averaged 40 percent of market capitalization, though the figure exceeded 70 percent by the first quarter of this year, according to Mr. Case, a result of the deep drop in share prices and, for a few, the wide availability of cheap debt. Now the goal for some REITs is to lower the average debt load to 25 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To that end, many REITs have taken advantage of improved conditions on Wall Street this year to issue additional shares. Those have included a wide range of companies like the <span class="companylink">Simon Property Group</span> and the <span class="companylink">Kimco Realty Corporation</span>, which own shopping centers, and <span class="companylink">Host Hotels &amp; Resorts</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There have been 52 secondary offerings through mid-June (18 in April alone), according to the REIT association, raising around $16 billion. By contrast, in all of 2008 there were 78 offerings that raised nearly $15 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite concerns that the offerings could dilute the value of current shares, and even hurt REIT share prices in the future, they have largely been well received by investors, who, analysts say, still consider many issues to be trading at bargain prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The investor believes that it will be a better company after the offering than before,'' said Paul Puryear, the director of real estate research at <span class="companylink">Raymond James &amp; Associates</span>, ''and so the feeling is, 'Why don't I participate in this discounted price?' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, Hamid Moghadam, the chairman and chief executive of the <span class="companylink">AMB Property Corporation</span>, said he was ''a little surprised'' by the strong investor demand. In late March, a secondary offering raised $550 million in less than a week. That money is now earmarked to help AMB shore up its balance sheet, repay loans and, Mr. Moghadam said, eventually allow the company to ''go on the offensive instead of the defensive.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industry analysts say it may be some time, however, before most REITs reach that enviable position.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For one thing, the commercial property market has been extraordinarily quiet lately. ''There's no trading right now; there's no property market to speak of,'' said Mr. Puryear, noting, too, that valuing properties remains an arduous task. ''We've been focusing on replacement costs: if you're going to build a new building, what would it cost?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This, of course, will make it hard for those REITs looking to sift through the detritus of available distressed properties -- especially if property market conditions get worse before they get better, as some expect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''REIT stocks have turned a corner,'' said Paul E. Adornato, a senior real estate analyst at BMO Capital Markets. ''But we fully expect fundamentals will worsen for just about all property types, and by that we mean we can expect higher vacancies, lower rents and more difficulties for all real estate players.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At AMB Property, for example, the proportion of space occupied at the warehouses and distribution centers it operates worldwide fell from a near-historic high of 96 percent at the end of the third quarter last year to 92.5 percent at the end of the first quarter of 2009, while rents slipped 3 to 4 percent, according to Mr. Moghadam.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, he remained hopeful that market conditions would begin to stabilize. ''In the last six months, the economy was basically falling off the cliff,'' he said. ''Now, instead of falling off the cliff, it is just rolling down the hill.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, industry analysts believe that some property sectors -- and companies -- are likely to recover sooner than others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Adornato singles out parts of the industrial and office sectors, while other analysts at BMO Capital Markets have a positive outlook on apartments, largely because that sector continues to have access to relatively inexpensive financing from <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, the government-controlled mortgage companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On BMO's preferred list is <span class="companylink">AvalonBay Communities</span>, which operates apartments in markets described as having a ''high barrier to entry,'' meaning that developers may encounter obstacles to construction, like strict zoning limitations or community resistance to new developments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Adornato particularly favors <span class="companylink">Liberty Property Trust</span>, which owns office and industrial space in more than 20 markets in the United States and Britain. ''They did not engage in development for sale to third parties,'' he said. ''Instead, they developed a smaller volume of properties intended for their own portfolio.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he also liked <span class="companylink">First Potomac Realty Trust</span>, which owns and operates office and industrial buildings in the Washington area. The economic stimulus package and new government programs, he said, will benefit that region. ''We expect job growth to return to Washington much earlier than the rest of the country,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Puryear, meanwhile, prefers REITs focused on health care, like Health Care REIT, which makes a range of investments, from housing for the elderly to hospitals and medical office buildings. ''This is a tremendous company with an outstanding track record,'' he said. ''They have a larger development pipeline than they would like to have, but they are leasing their properties very well and are well-financed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our view so far this year has been to play the more defensive sectors.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FEW developments rode the wave of high prices in the Manhattan residential real estate the way the 181 condominium apartments at the Plaza Hotel did, and few have chilled as much in the downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As it happened, the financial panic on Wall Street last September came just as the Plaza, the city's most expensive condominium conversion ever, per square foot, was hit by a wave of bad publicity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were complaints that the finishes and details did not live up to the building's luxurious image. A lawsuit by a Russian billionaire who signed up for a $53.5 million penthouse alleged ''bait and switch'' tactics. The suit and a countersuit by the Plaza were later settled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several buyers closed on apartments, but put them back on the market after barely a walk-through, including a gallery owner who bought five apartments, the Frank Lloyd Wright Suite among them, for $49.2 million, and promptly put them in the recycling bin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, inventory has been growing, and little has been selling. There are now about 30 listings at the Plaza, with a total asking price of more than $250 million. A review of property records as of last week shows that only one resale has closed since September 2008, a sharp reversal of fortune for a building that sometimes had two or three sponsor closings in a single day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May, a seventh-floor apartment sold for $8 million, more than 8 percent below the original $8.74 million price. A sponsor-owned unit also sold in May for $11.8 million. In the last few weeks, after price cuts and the public's reacquaintance with the Oak Room and other long-closed public spaces at the Plaza, activity has picked up, brokers say, and a handful of deals have been done.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carrie Chiang, a broker at <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span> with two apartments in contract at the Plaza, said buyers had begun to realize that despite the building's ''bad press,'' it was ''New York's trophy, a building that nobody can ever build again.'' She said her apartments were selling because they had the ''bargain prices'' in the building. ''If you buy low,'' she said, ''the value can only go higher.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She has just knocked more than $4 million off the price of two apartments on the fourth floor, including a $3 million cut in the asking price for the four-bedroom 4,000-square-foot Frank Lloyd Wright Suite. It is now priced at $18.5 million, down 28 percent from the $25.7 million asking price of last year and 14 percent from the $21.5 million sales price set in a contract signed in March 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Plaza, which is on Central Park South and Fifth Avenue, and 15 Central Park West, a new building a few blocks away at West 62nd Street, were the standout buildings at the height of the real estate boom, status symbols for multimillionaires. In the first quarter of 2008, closings at the two buildings drove the average condominium sale price in Manhattan up by 22 percent, to a record of more than $1.9 million, a level that may not be matched again for decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But since then, their fortunes have diverged. Despite the downturn, eight apartment resales at 15 Central Park West have closed since mid-September 2008, though only one so far in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan Miller, an appraiser and president of Miller Samuel Inc., said that at the peak, sales at the two buildings ''fed off each other,'' driving prices ever higher. He said that sales over the next two years would establish which building will hold its value better. ''The early signs are showing that 15 Central Park West has more interest,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 17th-floor apartment at the Plaza was listed in contract last week. It was owned by Oscar Schafer, a managing partner at O.S.S. Capital Management. Mr. Schafer closed on the three-bedroom apartment for $14.6 million in June 2008, and put it on the market the next month for $18 million. By the time it went into contract, the asking price was $12.5 million. The sale price was not disclosed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Roger Erickson, a broker at <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>, has one of the most expensive listings at the Plaza, the Astor Suite, with an asking price of $38 million, down from $55 million last year. After no buyer interest in the apartment for months, he said, several potential buyers, including one from Russia and one from Brazil, have come through. ''The negative publicity really put a cloud over the building,'' he said. ''We are seeing the sun through the clouds.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newport Beach, Calif. -- Every day, Bill Gross, the world's most successful bond fund manager, withdraws into a conference room at lunchtime with his lieutenants to discuss his firm's investments. The blinds are drawn to keep out the sunshine, and he forbids any fiddling with BlackBerrys or cellphones. He wants everyone disconnected from the outside world and focused on what matters most to him: mining riches for his clients at Pimco, the swiftly growing money management firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gross, 65, has long been celebrated for his eccentricities. He learned some of his lucrative investing strategies by gambling in Las Vegas. Many of his most inspired ideas arrived while he was standing on his head doing yoga. He knows he has to be well dressed for client meetings or television -- but instead of keeping his Hermès ties neatly knotted, he drapes them around his neck like scarves so he can labor with his collar open.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And with the collapse of Wall Street, Mr. Gross has emerged as one of the nation's most influential financiers. His frequent appearances on CNBC draw buzz, as do his wickedly humorous monthly investing columns on the Pimco Web site. Treasury secretaries call him for advice. Warren E. Buffett, the <span class="companylink">Berkshire Hathaway</span> chairman, and Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman, sing his praises.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He's a very individualistic person. He doesn't come at analysis or investment judgment in the words, terminology or ambience that I have been used to over the decades,'' Mr. Greenspan says. ''That may be the secret of his success. There is no doubt there is an extraordinary intellect there.'' Mr. Greenspan, it should be noted, now works for Pimco as a consultant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amid all of this, Mr. Gross and his firm are trying to shape the government's response to the economic crisis. He is one of the most fervent supporters of the Obama administration's plan to enlist private investors to help bail out the nation's ailing banks and try to revive the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That effort, known as the Public-Private Investment Program, or P.P.I.P., has gained little traction so far. But Mr. Gross has energetically defended its architect, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, against critics like the New York University economics professor Nouriel Roubini and the New York Times columnist Paul Krugman -- both of whom argue that the strategy is flawed and that it would be best for the government to temporarily nationalize so-called zombie banks to prevent a repeat of the Great Depression.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such nationalization, Mr. Gross insists, would be an unmitigated disaster. ''There are two grand plans,'' he said this spring at a meeting of his firm's investment committee. ''One is the Krugman-Roubini plan. They think the banks have so much garbage they are beyond hope. The other side is the administration's side. That's the one we're on. If the other side should ever gain credence, then we'll have something to worry about.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gross is hardly a disinterested observer. Pimco, owned by the German insurer Allianz, is jockeying to be picked by Mr. Geithner to relieve the likes of <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>, <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> and other banks of an estimated $1 trillion in soured mortgage debt so they can start lending freely again. Mr. Gross calls the plan a ''win-win-win'' for the banks, taxpayers and Pimco investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government is planning to announce soon which money managers will participate. A spokesman for the Treasury Department would not say whether Pimco would be one of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN many ways, it is perfectly logical for the White House to turn to someone like Mr. Gross at such a time. Few investors understand the mortgage market better. As co-chief investment officer, he personally manages Pimco's flagship, the Total Return fund, which has $158 billion in assets. As of the end of May, he had invested 61 percent of the fund's money in mortgage bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gross has always been partial to mortgage bonds. And why not? He has done fabulously well with them. In an October 2005 letter to investors, he made one of the most prescient calls of the last decade, warning of the looming subprime mortgage crisis. Almost everybody ignored him. Today, they wish they hadn't.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the housing bubble burst and the financial markets fell apart, investors lost billions of dollars. Not Mr. Gross's clients. Class A shares of the Total Return fund, for individual investors, were up 4.3 percent in 2008, or nine percentage points ahead of comparable bond funds, according to Morningstar; this year through Thursday, the shares were up 5.4 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the midst of an economic crisis, those numbers are impressive. So is the longer-term record: In the 10 years through Thursday, the fund had an annualized return of 6.42 percent, beating its benchmark by 0.54 percentage points, according to Morningstar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's one of the reasons the government has courted him closely. Last fall, the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of New York</span>, run at the time by Mr. Geithner, hired Pimco -- along with BlackRock, <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> and <span class="companylink">Wellington Management</span> -- to buy up to $1.25 trillion in mortgage bonds in an effort to keep interest rates from skyrocketing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last December, when it was pressing <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> to complete its ill-fated acquisition of <span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span>, the Federal Reserve also looked to Pimco for advice. According to recently released messages that Fed staff members sent one another that month, Pimco evaluated the two banks and concluded that Merrill wouldn't survive without a capital infusion or additional government aid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, Mr. Gross is eager to buy the same subprime loans he once refused to touch, as part of the Treasury's distressed-asset initiative. After all, the thinking goes, if anybody can figure out how much all this debt is worth, it's Pimco. But Pimco's involvement in so many aspects of the bailout has made many other financiers and analysts uncomfortable. They say its proximity to the Treasury Department and the Fed may allow it to reap billions of easy dollars through federal contracts and preferential investment opportunities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A frequent complaint is this: Why is the Federal Reserve paying Pimco to buy mortgage securities on its behalf, when the firm is already a huge buyer and seller of the same bonds? ''That's the equivalent of a no-bid contract in Iraq,'' fumes Barry Ritholtz, who runs an equity research firm in New York and writes The Big Picture, a popular and well-regarded economics blog. ''It's a license to steal.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one, of course, has actually accused Pimco of theft. But there is a larger question: Whose interests is the firm looking out for in the bailout? Money managers, after all, have a legal obligation -- a fiduciary responsibility -- to put the interest of their investors before anyone else. Even Mr. Gross acknowledges that Pimco's interests won't always be aligned with those of the government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gross points out that he has never even met Mr. Geithner. For its part, the Treasury Department plays down Pimco's influence. ''We speak with a number of market participants and believe seeking out a diversity of perspectives is critical to our efforts,'' says Andrew Williams, a spokesman for the department. He says the Treasury takes conflicts of interests ''very seriously in all cases.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gross is well aware of the criticism that has been directed at Pimco. During an interview at its headquarters in Newport Beach, Calif., sitting at his horseshoe-shaped desk on its 4,200-square-foot trading floor overlooking the Pacific Ocean, he brings up the topic of perceived conflicts of interest himself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He almost never personally buys and sells bonds. Pimco has dozens of traders who do this for him here. ''There's the mortgage desk over there,'' he says, pointing to a group of well-scrubbed young people hunched over computers. ''We've been buying some mortgages this morning. That's our baby, so to speak. That's our bag.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He immediately adds that this mortgage trading operation is completely separate from the one on the floor below, where traders are working on behalf of the Fed. He says he can't even visit that floor himself anymore without a company lawyer at his side. The last time he did was in December, when he wished the traders happy holidays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I said, 'Merry Christmas,' '' Mr. Gross recalls. ''The lawyer said, 'Mr. Gross says Merry Christmas.' Right then and there, I knew that communications were basically severed. That's the way the Fed wants it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He says he assumes that Pimco traders working on behalf of the government don't talk to their peers trading for Pimco's own accounts. Then again, he said he doesn't know for sure what happens after hours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't drink beer with these guys; I have no idea what happens in the privacy of their own homes,'' he says. He says that when he encounters traders working for the Fed outside the office, he doesn't talk to them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I pass some of them on the way to the lunch shop,'' he says. ''I just sort of wave. I don't know what to do.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. GROSS is fond of saying he is the antithesis of a Wall Street ''alpha male.'' He is every bit the Southern Californian, with longish hair and a laid-back attitude. Most Wall Street executives won't talk to a reporter without a public relations person hovering nearby. Even then, they can be disappointingly bland. No one would ever say such a thing about Mr. Gross. He approaches an interview is almost like a therapy session; it is a chance for him to make confessions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'll tell you an interesting story,'' he says at one point. ''I shouldn't, but I will. It's like I'm taking truth serum every time I do this.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tale is about ''a very childish and immature'' e-mail message that he sent Don Phillips, a managing director of Morningstar, the mutual fund research company, when Morningstar didn't select him as its fixed-income fund manager of the year in 2008. It is an intriguing story. But it's nowhere near as interesting as what he has to say about Pimco's role in the bailout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He sounds genuinely pained by the economic collapse. ''There was always a big part of me that thought the Depression was just something from my old American Heritage history books,'' he says. ''I thought: 'This stuff can't happen really. I mean, this is just for the economic philosophers and the paranoid worriers.' Then, in the last 6 to 12 months, you go, 'God, this just might happen!' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the fate of the largest banks still uncertain, a heated debate continues about how to fix the problem. Mr. Geithner wants to enlist money managers like Pimco to buy distressed bank assets with financial backing from the government. That way, his supporters argue, they can offer such generous prices that banks can disgorge the assets without too painful a hit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But proponents of bank nationalization say the Treasury's plan won't work because some banks can't afford to take any losses on asset sales. This camp believes nationalization is the best path because it will let the government clean up banks' balance sheets and restore their health.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gross argues that this would completely destabilize the financial markets. ''If you thought <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> was a mistake, just stand by and see what nationalizing Citi or B.of A. would do,'' he argued in one of his monthly letters to Pimco investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His mood brightens when he talks about how much money Pimco could reap by participating in the Geithner plan. No wonder: the terms are deliciously favorable for participants selected as fund managers. Money managers like Pimco would be expected to raise at least $500 million from their clients. The Treasury would match that with taxpayer dollars. Then Pimco and the Treasury would create a jointly owned fund of at least $1 billion that would buy distressed mortgage bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government largess doesn't stop there. The fund will be eligible for low-interest financing from both the Treasury and the Fed that analysts at Credit Suisse First Boston estimate could be as high as four times the total equity in the fund. So if Pimco ponied up $500 million, the fund that it manages could borrow $4 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pimco would then negotiate with banks to buy their wobbly mortgage-backed securities. Mr. Gross says that some of these securities pay an interest rate as high as 14 percent and that even if default rates were 70 percent, Pimco and the government would still make a 5 percent return after covering their negligible borrowing costs. That means the government-Pimco partnership could make at least $250 million in a year on a $5 billion investment fund. Of that amount, Pimco would get $125 million -- a 25 percent return on its original investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But here's the part that makes Mr. Gross salivate. If things go badly, the government is responsible for repaying all that debt. ''It's just like in blackjack,'' he says. ''That puts the odds in your favor. If you don't bet too much and if you stay at the table long enough, the odds are high that you are going to go home with some extra money in your pocket.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, for all of Mr. Gross's anguished talk about the crisis, there's no escaping the fact that Pimco isn't exactly suffering. In November, the Total Return fund became the world's largest mutual fund with $128.4 billion in assets, according to Morningstar. Since then, its assets under management have climbed to $158 billion. The firm once had trouble luring prospective employees to Newport Beach. Now Pimco is being deluged with résumés.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, some of the most powerful people in the nation call Mr. Gross for advice. ''Paulson will call, Geithner will call, and I'll be like, 'Yabba-dabba' or 'Blah-blah-blah,' '' he says with a measure of self-deprecation -- and an equal dose of pride. ''I turn into a walking, talking idiot.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gross has been through crises before. He nearly died -- and briefly lost part of his scalp -- in 1966 when he crashed his car while making a doughnut run for his fraternity brothers at Duke University. He spent much of his senior year recovering in the hospital. He also became obsessed with blackjack after reading ''Beat the Dealer: A Winning Strategy for the Game of Twenty-One,'' by Edward O. Thorp, an M.I.T. mathematics professor (who is now a very successful hedge fund manager).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After he got his diploma, Mr. Gross hopped a freight train to Las Vegas with $200 sewed into his pant leg. He played blackjack for 16 hours a day. ''After a while it gets pretty boring and pretty stinky,'' he recalls. ''People lose money. They don't win it. You're just watching the dealers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, in four months, he turned $200 into $10,000 and used his winnings to pay for his studies toward an M.B.A. at the University of California, Los Angeles. He thought he could apply the lessons learned at the blackjack table to the stock market. After getting the degree, he called all the big Wall Street brokerage firms. Nobody called him back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FINALLY, his mother showed him a classified ad for a junior credit analyst in the bond department at the <span class="companylink">Pacific Investment Management Company</span>, a subsidiary of Pacific Mutual Life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Mr. Gross had no interest in bonds, he took the job as a steppingstone to stock-picking. Back then, the bond market was a sleepy corner of the financial world. Mr. Gross's job was to make sure that Pimco avoided buying bonds from companies that might go belly-up and burn their creditors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the mid-1970s, the market had become sexier as shrewd investors like Mr. Gross began trading bonds like stocks -- and began earning outsize profits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In short order, Mr. Gross also dived into the first mortgage-backed securities (which carried comfy government guarantees) and began studiously monitoring interest rates so he could place bets on his own macroeconomic predictions. This was highly unusual for a bond fund manager -- and still is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are a lot of big bond shops that frankly don't feel confident doing this,'' says Lawrence Jones, a Morningstar analyst. ''It's not part of their tool kit.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gross played well on television. In 1983, he became a regular on ''Wall Street Week'' on PBS; he loved the attention, and his ubiquity gave Pimco a big boost. Four years later, Pimco rolled out the Total Return fund. Over the next 10 years, its assets soared to $24 billion from $165 million. Much of this was because of shrewd investing. But TV did wonders, too. ''It doesn't do you any good to be good if nobody knows about you,'' Mr. Gross says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1999, he warned in his monthly investment column that the dot-com bubble would soon burst. The next year, it did. Despite the market downdraft, Mr. Gross's fund ended 2000 up 12 percent, and that same year he and his partners sold Pimco to Allianz for $3.3 billion. Mr. Gross received $233 million for his stake, and Allianz also agreed to pay him $40 million in retention bonuses and seems to be giving him free rein.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not that Mr. Gross was going anywhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FREE from distraction in a gym across the street from his offices, Mr. Gross happily rides a stationary bike, followed by a half-hour of yoga. Toward the end of his routine, he stands on his head for a few minutes in a position called the Feathered Peacock. He wobbles so much that you expect him to lose his balance and fall over, but he says some of his best ideas have come to him while he was upside down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of those insights came in 2005, when -- while standing on his head -- he began to worry about the real estate bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He'd watched the prices of homes climb into the stratosphere in Southern California, and he says he felt as if he were witnessing something out of ''Alice in Wonderland.'' Was this happening all around the country?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pimco dispatched 11 mortgage analysts to 20 cities to find out. They posed as prospective homebuyers and drove around with unsuspecting real estate agents and mortgage brokers who told them how easily they could get a home loan. ''It was a little deceptive,'' Mr. Gross says. ''I didn't feel good about that, but I didn't know how else to get the real information.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gross says he thought it was obvious what was driving this madness: subprime mortgages. He was certain that the real estate market would collapse and take the economy down with it, and he made those thoughts known in letters to his investors. Pimco steered clear of risky housing debt, which meant that, for a time, some of his competitors who stockpiled the briefly lucrative products outperformed him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a fiercely competitive man, it was an awkward time. ''Bill takes it hard when the numbers aren't what he thinks they should be,'' his wife, Sue, confided by e-mail. ''In 2006, he recommended a Pimco bond fund to the owner of a local doughnut shop, and when it didn't do well for a while, he could hardly go in the shop for his favorite coconut cake doughnut.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fortunately for Mr. Gross, but not for the economy, this couldn't last forever. The housing bubble finally burst in 2007, and the crisis followed. He was vindicated. Yet this was only part of the reason for his success. He also predicted in one of his monthly columns that the government would have to pump billions of dollars into the economy to avert a total collapse. At the same time, he and his Pimco team came up with an audacious plan: invest in bond sectors that Washington would be forced to support -- like government-backed mortgages guaranteed by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gross whimsically calls this strategy ''shake hands with the government.'' And he used his access to the news media to get the government's attention. In a CNBC interview on Aug. 20, 2008, he argued that Americans were putting ''their money in the mattress'' because the government hadn't rescued imperiled financial institutions like Fannie and Freddie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Sept. 7, Henry M. Paulson Jr., then the Treasury secretary, announced that the government was taking over Fannie and Freddie. The value of the Total Return fund rose by $1.7 billion in a single day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michele Davis, Mr. Paulson's former spokeswoman, says Mr. Gross's TV appearances had nothing to do with the decision: ''There are $5.4 trillion of Fannie and Freddie securities around the world. Investors here and across the globe were worried and voicing the same concerns.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some of Pimco's critics aren't convinced. ''The Treasury Department watches CNBC all day,'' says Steven Eisman, a portfolio manager and banking expert at <span class="companylink">FrontPoint Partners</span>, an investment firm. ''I know that for a fact. He was putting pressure on them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gross says nothing could have been further from his mind. He says he goes on TV with ''a disbelief that people will believe or act on what I say,'' adding that ''people should think independently.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, Pimco tried to influence the direction of the bailout itself. In the spring of 2008, Pimco's chief executive, Mohamed A. el-Erian, a former policy expert at the International Monetary Fund, floated a plan in Washington for a public-private partnership similar to the P.P.I.P. plan that Mr. Geithner later unveiled. It didn't get much traction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But then <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> collapsed on Sept. 15. Mr. Paulson asked Congress to pass the Troubled Asset Relief Plan, better known as TARP, which would enable the government to spend $700 billion to buy mortgage securities from teetering banks. The Treasury turned to Pimco and others for help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When we first asked for the TARP legislation in September, we were looking at purchasing assets,'' says Ms. Davis, the former Treasury spokeswoman. ''We definitely talked to Pimco and a lot of other asset managers. You had to find out how such a program might work and bounce ideas around to see how this thing would work.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the midst of the crisis, in October, Mr. Gross's friend, Mr. Buffett, wrote to Mr. Paulson suggesting a plan similar to the one Mr. Erian had been pushing. However, Mr. Buffett says he came up with his idea independently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I called Bill Gross and Mohamed and said: 'I've got this idea. If it goes forward, I hope you guys would manage it and would do it on a pro bono basis,' '' Mr. Buffett recalled in an interview. ''Within an hour, they said they were on board and they were willing to do whatever was called for.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gross publicly announced that his firm would do the job free. ''I got call after call, e-mail after e-mail saying what Bill offered was right for the country and that he was a great American,'' says a Pimco spokesman, Mark J. Porterfield. At first, it looked as if the Treasury might take Mr. Gross up on the offer. But his hopes were temporarily dashed when the Treasury simply gave TARP funds to the banks instead of purchasing bad assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And at the same time, people began to wonder about Mr. Gross's motives. He made it clear that he was not afraid to put Pimco's interests ahead of the government's in the bailout. As part of its ''shake hands with the government'' strategy, Pimco had bet that the Bush administration would come to the rescue of the nation's banks and other financial institutions. So it bought a variety of those bonds, including those of GMAC, the financial division of General Motors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In November, as the economy continued to weaken, GMAC asked the Fed for permission to become a bank holding company so it could receive TARP financing. The central bank granted GMAC's wish, with one caveat: GMAC had to swap 75 percent of its debt for equity, allowing GMAC to potentially buy back a big chunk of its bonds for just 60 cents on the dollar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gross balked at the arrangement because, as a GMAC bondholder, he would have been forced to take a big financial haircut. ''We said: 'It doesn't look too good to us. We think we'll just hold onto the existing bonds,' '' he remembered. Much to the amazement of many people on Wall Street, the Federal Reserve, which declined to comment, still allowed GMAC to become a bank holding company and the government later guaranteed all of its debt, meaning that Mr. Gross's GMAC bonds would be worth 100 cents on the dollar when they mature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gross is unapologetic about the outcome. ''The government has a vested interest, and it's not necessarily aligned with Pimco's interest,'' he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SIMON JOHNSON, a former chief economist for the International Monetary Fund and now a professor at the Sloan School of Management at M.I.T., says he isn't surprised that Mr. Gross is such a virulent foe of nationalization. As Professor Johnson points out, Pimco is a major bondholder in some of the biggest banks. Nationalization would hurt his portfolio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It would reduce the present value of his holding,'' says Professor Johnson, himself a proponent of nationalization. ''Therefore, he is not going to look good as an investment manager.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What of Mr. Gross's predictions that nationalization would deepen the recession? Professor Johnson acknowledges that there are risks either way, but says he thinks that people should be skeptical when powerful financiers make doomsday predictions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think we pay undue deference to people who are very rich and have been successful in the financial sector in this country,'' he says. ''We think they are the gurus who think they have unique expertise, and if Bill Gross tells us there will be a panic, it must be true. Well, no, I don't believe it. These guys all say this kind of thing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The twist, of course, is that the Obama administration has embraced the same public-private partnership proposal that Pimco has been pushing along and that Mr. Paulson briefly considered last fall. Mr. Gross says that the Geithner plan is better because the government provides such generous debt financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pimco is proud of its partnership with the government. Mr. Erian points out that the firm's executives have been members of the Treasury Department's Borrowing Advisory Committee (along with many other Wall Street executives) for years. Its current representative, the Pimco managing director Paul McCulley, says part of his job is to ingratiate himself with officials at the Treasury and the Federal Reserve so Pimco can better understand impending policy decisions. He boasts that he is on a ''first-name basis'' with both Mr. Geithner and the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have a whole lot bigger profile now than we did years ago, but the fact of the matter is we've been doing the same thing in the last year that we've been doing for the last 10 years,'' Mr. McCulley says. ''I'd like to think we're having some influence in the public policy arena. And I say that first and foremost as a citizen.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Citizen -- but also investor. And some critics of the financial benefits that Pimco might snare if the P.P.I.P. gets rolling are quick to point out what Pimco stands to gain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The critics would argue that all the benefits go to Pimco,'' says Representative Scott Garrett, Republican of New Jersey, who is a member of the House Financial Services Committee and a skeptic of the Geithner plan. ''Well, maybe not all the benefits. But they get the best ones right out the door. And the taxpayers are on the hook.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama administration says it will soon select lead fund managers for P.P.I.P. It's almost certain that Pimco will be among them. ''If you are trying to encourage investment from the private sector, isn't it only logical to involve the most successful asset management organizations in the private sector?'' says Thomas C. Priore, chief of ICP Capital, a boutique fixed-income investment bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And being selected by the government has other benefits, Mr. Priore adds. ''If any endowment or public pension plan representative is looking for an asset management firm, he or she won't get fired for hiring Pimco because, well, the government hired Pimco,'' he says. ''That certainly enhances your franchise value.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">P.P.I.P.'s fate remains uncertain. When the Treasury Department put 19 of the nation's largest banks through a stress test, many passed the exam and their stocks prices rose. They have raised $50 billion in new capital. Now some of them are likely to hold on to their distressed mortgage securities in the hope that the housing market recovers -- rather than face the pain of selling the assets at a loss now (a situation that may get dicey if housing doesn't, in fact, recover).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Treasury now says that Mr. Geithner expects P.P.I.P. to serve as ''backstop'' for banks that find themselves in a pinch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's a darker scenario, possibly. If mortgage default rates do soar, some big banks may fail. Then the administration would have to seriously consider nationalization, which might devastate Mr. Gross's holdings. He is, of course, well of aware of this possibility and says he's watching Mr. Geithner as closely as he watched the blackjack dealers in Las Vegas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We just don't want to flush it all down the drain,'' he says. ''You want to shake hands with the government. But maybe it shouldn't be a super-firm handshake.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AT a lunchtime meeting this past spring at Pimco, executives tell Mr. Gross that they're worried about the fallout the firm will face if it receives a financial windfall as part of P.P.I.P.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The risk is that you have a Congress with a populist bug,'' Mr. McCulley says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dan Ivascyn, another of the firm's managing directors, agrees. ''I think there is a risk that we're going to get criticized,'' he says. ''I think Pimco could get roughed up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think there is a much bigger chance of us getting roughed up personally,'' says Scott Simon, head of Pimco's mortgage-backed securities team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, Mr. Gross weighs in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''So what are you saying?'' he asks. ''If we fail, we'll get the shaft, and if we succeed, we'll get the shaft?''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of new homes leapt back in May after dropping sharply a month earlier, the government reported on Tuesday, signaling that the housing and construction markets might be hitting a bottom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another report, the government said that prices received by producers for finished goods rose a smaller-than-expected 0.2 percent in May, hinting that Wall Street's fears of inflation may be exaggerated. Still, energy prices rose the most since January, with gasoline prices up nearly 14 percent for the month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So-called core producer prices, which exclude food and energy costs, fell 0.1 percent, indicating broad pressure on prices because of lower demand across the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, the government will release its monthly index of consumer prices, which reflects what consumers are paying at cash registers and gasoline pumps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts in the United States rose 17.2 percent from April -- far exceeding economists' expectations -- as construction of single-family homes increased for a third month. Construction of apartment buildings and condominiums rebounded after falling steeply in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits rose 4 percent for the month, but housing completions fell 3.3 percent from April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, housing starts in May increased to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 532,000, an improvement from earlier this year but still down 45.2 percent from the pace of home construction in May a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while these levels of construction could mark a bottom, they are not likely to be the start of a turnaround, some experts said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a real possibility they will just stall at a low level,'' said Kenneth Simonson, chief economist of the Associated General Contractors of America. ''If the recent jump in interest rates is sustained, that could choke off buyer enthusiasm for new homes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rates on a 30-year fixed mortgage have risen to more than 5.5 percent, from record lows of 4.8 percent, since May as yields on government bonds crept up. Some housing experts worry that rising mortgage costs could reduce mortgage refinancing and drive potential buyers out of the housing market. Construction of multifamily units rose 61.7 percent in May to an annual rate of 131,000 units, after a decline of 49.4 percent in April. But economists said the multifamily sector of the housing market would probably stay weak, as evidenced by half-finished apartment towers across the country and the number of condo projects that are renting out units as a way to make money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The folks who would be renting homes are the ones having the hardest time finding or keeping jobs,'' Mr. Simonson said. ''New college graduates are moving back in with Mom and Dad instead of renting their first place.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders are likely to remain wary of breaking ground on new projects, economists said. Credit markets remain tight for construction loans and potential buyers are still worried about losing their jobs or further declines in home values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While that means fewer construction jobs and more pain for contractors, electricians and other workers, many economists say that housing starts need to remain low to rebalance the gap between supply and demand in the housing market. About four million homes are now for sale, with more cheap foreclosures and distressed properties hitting the market every day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The inventory overhang means any recovery in building will be very muted for an extended period,'' Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics, wrote in a note. ''But at least the very worst is over.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a third report, the Federal Reserve reported that industrial production fell more than expected -- 1.1 percent -- in May. Output was also weaker -- down 0.7 percent -- in April than initially reported.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE panic in the Manhattan real estate market of the winter of 2009 lifted in the last few weeks, brokers say, as more and more buyers and sellers have found the courage and the comfort level to sign on the dotted line. A bidding war has even occasionally broken out, though at prices far below those of a year ago, and often considerably below asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When we were in free fall, nobody was willing to pull the trigger,'' said John B. Gomes, a broker at Core Group Marketing. ''Sellers are more realistic and buyers are optimistic, and we have the lowest interest rates in a generation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is considerable room for skepticism, since the number of closed sales filed with the city remains near the lowest level in many years. Prices are still down as much as 30 percent and show no signs of rising, low-ball offers remain common and some of these latest deals may never come to fruition. But brokers say the climate has definitely changed, producing sales at all price points, as some buyers, tired of looking and waiting, are seizing the moment. Suddenly, brokers say, it is exciting to be in real estate again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deals picked up first among studios and one-bedrooms, which benefited from a combination of lower prices, reduced interest rates and incentives for first-time buyers. Then apartments selling under $3 million began to stir. Finally, in the last few weeks, a number of significant deals have been done in the somnolent market for trophy apartments listed above $10 million, brokers say. Sales of many expensive new Manhattan condominiums remain sluggish, however.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Brown Harris Stevens, a real estate brokerage firm, contracts were off 60 percent last fall, after the collapse of <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span>, and a steep plunge in the stock market brought deal making to a near halt. But Hall F. Willkie, the company's president, said that as spring -- the peak selling season in New York -- got under way, contracts picked up sharply. Sales, off 30 percent in April from a year earlier, were off less than 10 percent in May compared with the same month in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are busy, very busy and the tempo is intense, and that is all great,'' Mr. Willkie said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Halstead Property, Diane Ramirez, the company's president, said that contract signings in May had surpassed the number of deals reached the year before. She said many of the sales were to first-timers, and to buyers who had long been priced out of the Manhattan market but were now seeing an opportunity to get in. Some buyers who have lost out on previous deals are showing up at open houses and making offers on the spot, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bill Kowalczuk, a broker with <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, says that what has changed is that buyers are ''willing to step up to the plate'' and when they do, ''sellers are listening.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kowalczuk has been trying for 17 months to sell a four-story town house, in need of considerable work, on West 21st Street in Chelsea near Ninth Avenue. By January he had cut the asking price by more than 25 percent to just under $4.8 million. A few weeks ago, he said, three buyers made serious offers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A deal was almost immediately struck with one couple. But after a bank reneged on a previously approved mortgage, they backed out. Mr. Kowalczuk quickly went to contract with a second buyer, who was planning to finance the purchase by taking out a home equity loan on property in London. The final price was below $4 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in activity does not mean that the local real estate recession is over. Prices remain sharply lower than they were a year ago, by about 30 percent, and are likely to continue to drift downward over many months, or even years, until the local economy, heavily dependent on Wall Street profits, picks up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is also some debate about whether the bump up in activity, which many brokers say has kept them busy showing apartments seven days a week, represents a predictable seasonal uptick, or a shift in market psychology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Actual closings filed with the city's Department of Finance are sparse, but these often lag behind the market, because closings can occur months after a deal is struck, especially when co-op or condominium boards have a right to review contracts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of the end of May, the overall number of apartments closing in the second quarter was off 55 percent from the same period a year earlier, though up slightly from the first quarter. Co-op closings rose significantly from the first quarter, while condo closings fell as the backlog of contracts signed in new buildings many months ago began to shrink.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both average and median apartment prices are off roughly 15 percent so far in the second quarter, compared with same period a year ago, with the median at $812,000, the lowest level in more than two years, according to a tabulation of city property filings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan Miller, an appraiser at Miller Samuel who prepares market reports for Prudential Douglas Elliman, confirmed that inventory levels began to fall this spring as sales picked up. But he questioned how significant the trend would turn out to be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You did see an upturn in activity this time of year,'' he said, but ''it was not a robust spring.'' Mr. Miller said that the spring did not ''undo the damage that occurred last fall'' during the banking crisis, and that prices still appeared to be slipping, though at a slower pace than earlier in the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miller says he is particularly worried about new developments that have not cut prices as much as many individual sellers have. Mortgages can be difficult to come by in these buildings, making it harder for buyers to complete deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kirk Henckels, a Stribling broker who prepares a report on the luxury market, doesn't foresee a rise in prices anytime soon. He said he thought they might fall a bit further; he also feels that prices are in the process of stabilizing amid a burst of deal making.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last July, Mr. Henckels listed an 18-foot-wide town house at 136 East 80th Street near Lexington Avenue for nearly $12 million. By February the price of the town house, owned by Thomas Flexner, a former vice chairman of <span class="companylink">Bear Stearns</span>, had been cut by 25 percent, to $8.95 million. After languishing over a slow winter, it went into contract at the end of May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Henckels said that over the winter, buyers felt they were in a ''deflationary market'' and had no reason to buy, since prices would most likely keep falling. With prices now off 30 percent, buyers feel the damage has been done and are tired of looking, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's rather remarkable,'' he said. ''I did five to six deals in the last two weeks at all price ranges.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Burger, a broker with Brown Harris Stevens who just sold a $12 million apartment at One Beacon Court on 58th Street near Third Avenue, attributes the market uptick to the rebound in the stock market since March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The stock market has always been a barometer for the health of the Manhattan real estate market,'' he said. ''Buyers are encouraged by the rebound on Wall Street. It has given people a sense of security to stop and make deals.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of these trends can be seen in the battle over a one-bedroom apartment on the second floor of the Grand Madison at 225 Fifth Avenue and 27th Street. A former showroom building for the gift industry, it was converted to condominiums a few years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment has 11-foot ceilings, a stylish kitchen and a home office, and at 1,200 square feet, is unusually large for a one-bedroom. But it has limited views, facing the Museum of Sex rather than Madison Square Park. Two years ago, in a rising market, an investor paid $1.35 million for it, $1.2 million of which was borrowed money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the rental market soured, the seller came under pressure to pay the mortgage, and Jaylin Ramer, a broker at Bond New York, listed the unit in March for $1.15 million, 15 percent below the original purchase price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along came Luke Sager, a recent Harvard graduate and co-captain of the college soccer team, looking for his first apartment in New York. Working with Emily Beare of Core Group Marketing, he methodically studied the market, visiting 50 apartments over three months, she said. Love struck when he saw the apartment at the Grand Madison.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ms. Ramer was listing the apartment as a ''short-sale opportunity,'' and other buyers were interested. An offer of $1 million in March was turned down cold, but as time went by the seller decided to be more flexible. Then, during a single week in May, three separate offers came in: one for $825,000; a second, Mr. Sager's, for $850,000, half in cash; and a third for $900,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sager countered with a $925,000 bid, all in cash, and to circumvent any more bargaining, insisted that the contract be signed the same day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so it was, but now Mr. Sager is waiting for the seller to complete his negotiations with the bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Ramer said that she and her colleagues had been involved in three bidding wars in the last week and that their negotiated deals were running ahead of those a year ago. She said she was working with several buyers who had been waiting, sometimes for years, for prices to come down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of people I know couldn't afford to live in Manhattan a year ago, not even close,'' she said. ''The people who were waiting on the sidelines are now out, and they are having great values and they are now buying.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dolly Lenz, a broker at Prudential Douglas Elliman, said she had several first-time apartment buyers about to sign contracts. These buyers had not been priced out -- they currently live in luxury buildings on the Upper East Side, paying rents of around $8,000 a month. But drawn by the prospect of deals, they are willing to spend up to $8 million or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You don't think of these people as first-time buyers, when they have an oceanfront house in Quogue,'' she said. ''But this guy has always rented in New York.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The number of home buyers who agreed to buy a previously occupied home rose the most in nearly eight years in April as the median sales price dropped by about 15 percent, a real estate trade group said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said its seasonally adjusted index of sales contracts signed in April rose 6.7 percent, to 90.3, far exceeding analysts' forecasts. It was the biggest monthly increase since October 2001, when pending sales rose 9.2 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase most likely reflects the impact of a new $8,000 tax credit for first-time home buyers that was included in the economic stimulus bill signed by President Obama in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since buyers need to complete their purchases by Nov. 30 to claim the credit, ''we expect greater activity in the months ahead,'' Lawrence Yun, the chief economist of the National Association of Realtors, said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national median sales price in April fell more than 15 percent from year-ago levels, to $170,200, driven by sales of inexpensive foreclosures and other distressed low-end properties. That was the second-largest yearly price drop on record, according to the association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group's index of pending sales contracts was 3.2 percent above last year's levels and has risen for three consecutive months after hitting a record low in January. A nearly 33 percent sales increase in the Northeast and a 9.8 percent gain in the Midwest led the overall surge. Sales contracts were flat or up slightly in the South and West.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A glut of unsold homes continued to grow last month, fed by a new wave of foreclosures, even though sales of existing homes rose, a national real estate trade association said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors reported that the inventory of unsold houses, townhouses and condominiums rose to 3.97 million in April, the highest level since November. At the current rate of sales, it would take 10.2 months to exhaust those unsold properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've got all this looming inventory out there, and the likelihood that whatever gains we see in sales are going to be pretty anemic,'' said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR. ''If you look at the broad middle of the market, price adjustment has a long way to go because of this whole inventory issue.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing experts said more homes would come on the market as the job market deteriorated, threatening previously secure homeowners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An additional 313,000 homes entered foreclosure in the first two months of 2009, according to First American CoreLogic, a real estate analysis firm. More are expected as one-time delays to foreclosures end, and lenders resume proceedings against delinquent homeowners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although home builders are starting few new projects, the supply of houses is still overwhelming the market. The Realtors' association said inventories grew last month even though sales of previously owned homes picked up as buyers went looking for bargains and lower-priced properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median home price nationwide climbed slightly, to $170,200 in April from $169,900 in March, the group reported. Prices, however, were down from $201,300 in April a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the country, existing home sales rose 2.9 percent in April from a month earlier but were down 3.5 percent from a year ago, the National Association of Realtors reported. Sales rose 11.6 percent in the Northeast and were up modestly in the South and the West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As sales in some markets pick up, home prices are still dragging on the bottom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices of single-family homes fell as fast as ever in March, according to figures released Tuesday by the closely watched <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case-Shiller Home Price Index. Home values in 20 major metropolitan areas fell 18.7 percent from a year earlier, an almost identical drop to that of the previous month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patrick Newport, United States economist at IHS Global Insight, said prices needed to fall even farther to work off excess supplies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That will bring more people into the market who will start buying homes,'' he said. ''Eventually that will get rid of the inventory.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To some degree, the same factors dragging down home prices are the ones that have revived sales in some regions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Activity has picked up in some hard-hit markets where the foreclosure crisis is the most acute and housing prices have fallen the most. In places like Florida, Arizona and parts of Southern California, potential buyers are getting back into the housing market, enticed by low prices and some of the lowest mortgage rates in years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agents' association estimated that about 45 percent of all sales in April were foreclosures, and brokers in distressed markets are bracing for more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Inventory numbers here are getting worse, not better,'' said Mike Morgan, a real-estate agent in Florida who writes about the housing market. ''We have more homes than we have people to live in them.''</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Home Prices Declined Again in March as Banks Sold More Foreclosed Properties</span>
</div><div class="author">By DAVID STREITFELD   </div><div>798 words</div><div>27 May 2009</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales may be up in many parts of the country but prices continue to scrape along the floor, raising fresh doubts about the recovery of a critical sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices in 20 major metropolitan areas dropped by 18.7 percent in March when compared with the same month a year ago, according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case-ShillerHome Price Index that was released Tuesday. That was about the same as February and just shy of January's record plunge of 19 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Foreclosures have picked up, and that seems to be pushing prices down,'' said David M. Blitzer, chairman of S.&amp; P.'s index committee. ''The recession is really biting.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seventeen of the cities tracked by the index declined from February. That was an improvement over the previous month, when prices in all 20 areas fell. Denver and Charlotte, N.C., managed tiny gains, while Dallas was flat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many urban areas, including those tracked by Case-Shiller, the residential real estate market is essentially cleaved in two. The top half of the market is largely stagnant, with owners unwilling to sell and buyers unable to buy. ''Move-up'' families seeking another bedroom or a better kitchen are an endangered species.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The low end, however, is sizzling, as investors armed with cash and first-time buyers equipped with tax breaks compete for foreclosed properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, some argue, the Case-Shiller numbers make the market appear worse than it is. Minneapolis is a case in point. Prices there plunged 6.1 percent from February to March -- the largest single-month drop for a city in the history of the index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The area was not prone to the bubble excesses of California or Florida, but it has its share of foreclosures. Until recently, banks tried to hold on to these houses to get the best price, said Steve Havig, president of the Minneapolis Area Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overwhelmed, the banks are now taking a different approach: dumping the properties to clear their books, making them ''extremely motivated sellers,'' as Mr. Havig calls them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These bargain homes make up nearly half the sales in Minneapolis, and are a big reason the agents' own numbers show a one-year median price decline of 22.9 percent. That closely matches the corresponding Case-Shiller drop of 23.3 percent. But when foreclosures and short sales are stripped out, the decline for so-called traditional homes is much smaller: 2.3 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Clearly, there are two different markets operating here,'' Mr. Havig said. That can lead to frustration among buyers of traditional houses, who expect better deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another national flood of foreclosures, which many are predicting for this summer, would continue to push down the indexes. But even if that does not happen, many analysts predict more pain for homeowners who want to sell or refinance. Buyers who do not get a foreclosure, meanwhile, might feel they can afford to wait.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is highly unlikely that the overall price adjustment seen to date is sufficient to balance supply (which is enormous) with demand,'' Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist for MFR, wrote Tuesday in a note to clients. He estimated the index was only two-thirds of the way to its ultimate bottom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some experts had predicted slightly better March numbers, by which they meant that the relentless rate of decline would noticeably slow. They were disappointed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Were this pace to continue, the loss of housing wealth this year would be roughly equal to the entire G.D.P. of China,'' Ian Shepherdson of High Frequency Economics wrote in a research note. With household wealth evaporating, he added, ''consumption will be very weak for the foreseeable future.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York and Detroit, which both showed large monthly declines in March, show the different legacies of the boom. Prices in New York are still up 73.4 percent from January 2000, while those in Detroit are 29 percent lower. A Detroit house costs about the same today as it did 14 years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Las Vegas joined Phoenix in showing a decline from the area's peak of more than 50 percent. Dallas, which never had much of a housing boom, is the best-performing city in the index, down 11.1 percent from its peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national Case-Shiller index for the first quarter, also released Tuesday, showed a 19.1 percent decline compared with the first quarter of 2008, the biggest drop in the index's 21-year history.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.I was wondering if you could give a general overview of Roth I.R.A.'s. I hear that in a couple of years there might be new laws governing the Roth I.R.A.'s which might make it pretty much the same or worse than that regular I.R.A.'s. How does investing in Roth I.R.A.'s better or worse in the short run, or even in the long run for a student whose come out with lots of loans and is still searching for a job?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marian from N.Y.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. SETHI A Roth I.R.A. is a type of retirement account with significant tax advantages that can make you tons of money over the long term. Once you contribute money to it -- currently up to $5,000 per year -- you can invest in whatever you want: target-date funds (my favorite), stocks, bonds, etc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Roth I.R.A. account is better than just saving cash or a regular (taxable) account: First, it allows you to invest, which will make you significantly more over the long term that simple savings alone. More important, you save hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compare these scenarios for someone who invests $5,000 per year:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After five years, you'll have about $31,000 within a Roth, or just under $30,000 in a taxable account.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after 20 years, you'll have $247,000 in your Roth, or only $194,000 in a taxable account.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And after 30 years, you'll have $611,000 (Roth) versus $419,000 in a taxable account.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taxes eat huge parts of your returns, so most people would be better served to forget about fancy tax-optimization strategies and simply max out their 401(k)'s and Roth I.R.A.'s with target-date funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And don't worry about your money being locked up for 30 years. Many people don't know this, but you can withdraw your principal -- that's the amount you contribute to your Roth I.R.A. -- at any time, penalty-free. If you don't have money for a six-month emergency fund, your Roth can effectively serve as a replacement savings account if you seriously need it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You mentioned being concerned about future laws and rule changes to Roth I.R.A.'s. Don't worry about that now -- while most people spin their wheels and debate minutiae, the most important thing is to get started today. Focus on what you can control, not what's on the news every night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. KOBLINER Don't worry about rumors of what may happen with Roth I.R.A.'s. There are always people out there blogging about how this or that may happen with the tax code, but we don't really know. I like Roth I.R.A.'s more than traditional I.R.A.'s for a lot of reasons. The big one is that you can withdraw the money you put into a Roth I.R.A. for any reason without taxes or penalties. Although you'll ideally keep that money in there until you retire, life can trip people up sometimes and with the Roth it's good to know the money is there -- and you won't get hit with penalties and taxes if you absolutely need it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are situations where a traditional IRA makes more sense. Ask yourself these questions:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Can a traditional I.R.A. get you a tax deduction? You can deduct up to $5,000 a year in contributions to a traditional I.R.A. if you aren't eligible for a 401(k) or if your adjusted gross income is under $55,000 as a single person or $89,000 in a married couple. If you don't qualify for the break, the Roth is your answer. Case closed, you don't have to read anymore. (The cutoff for full Roth contributions is $105,000 for single people or $166,000 for married couples.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Can you contribute the full $5,000 this year? A Roth I.R.A. doesn't provide any upfront tax break, so depositing $5,000 in the account will cost you $5,000. If you can do that comfortably, go with the Roth. Otherwise, someone in the 25 percent tax bracket may still be able to deposit the full $5,000 in a deductible I.R.A., collect a $1,250 tax break and only end up $3,750 out of pocket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Will you be in a higher tax bracket when you retire? No one can answer this. It's one of those eternal personal finance questions, but some people say it can make a difference in your decision. With a traditional I.R.A., you pay tax on the money after you turn 591/2 and start withdrawing it. With a Roth, money is taxed before you contribute, but after that it will grow tax-free forever. I say forget this one and just go with the Roth if you can afford it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.With all the media attention on the down housing market it is hard not to consider the possibility of owning a home. At what percentage of your monthly income would you consider committing to a mortgage payment? How do you factor in insurance, taxes, and the age of the home?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kelly Seiler, San Diego</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. KOBLINER Mortgage interest rates are crazy low, less than 5 percent if you have good credit, and home prices in many areas are down. But I believe it really only makes sense to buy a home if you know you will stay in it for a while. So make sure it's big enough for you now, and in five years or so. I've known so many people who bought tiny places in their late 20s and then suddenly got married and had a kid or two and had to sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's the scoop on the percentage of your monthly income that should go toward paying a mortgage. A few years ago, the housing world went crazy and lenders were handing out mortgages to anyone, regardless of income or down payment. But now, something like the old rules are back in vogue and lenders want to make sure you can actually afford your payments. They're looking for proof that your future monthly housing costs (principal, interest, property taxes and insurance) will be around 28 to 33 percent of your gross monthly income. One tip: Look into Federal Housing Administration mortgages at www.fha.gov[http://www.fha.gov], since they require lower down payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Our son, graduated from college (debt-free, due to parental support) and for the past five years has had low-level jobs in which he was paid ''under the counter.'' For almost two of those years, he lived abroad, part of it employed as a language teacher in foreign countries. To our knowledge, he has never filed a tax return, had health insurance, etc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He's now back in the United States, living in a large city. How can we encourage our son to evaluate his options -- and stay out of trouble with the I.R.S.? They have a long reach. I don't imagine he's alone in this regard. I also don't think he has any idea of what to do to get back on track and avoid prosecution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We are definitely not interested in having him pay back taxes. It would be horrendously complicated and not worth the trouble in our humble opinion. We just want him to be able to ''get back on the merry-go-round'' when he does find a job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among other reasons, we' like to see him start amassing quarters of work so that if he were to become disabled -- some of the jobs have been risky -- he'd be eligible for Social Security disability payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, just to head off any potential insistence that he pay his back taxes: Does that somehow make sense, with an income under $10,000.What are the tax rules on income earned abroad? What triggers the designation as taxable income? Amount earned? Length of time away from the United States?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anonymous</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. KOBLINER Geez. This one is complicated. I should say upfront that I would contact the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (www.aicpa.org[http://www.aicpa.org]) to see if they can steer him to a one-time consultation with a good accountant. You want to make sure to do this correctly, and while I've dated some accountants, I am not one myself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, get the rules for what he should have done when he was living abroad by searching IRS.gov for ''citizens overseas.'' This is what I got from that site: The rules for reporting foreign income got more lenient in the 1990s; last year, for example, he might have been able to exclude up to $87,600 from his taxable income, and he wouldn't have had to file at all if he earned less than $8,950. But if he had to file, I think the I.R.S. still wants to see his returns, no matter how late they are.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.I am 23 and I graduated from college in December. I graduated with about $60,000 in student loans and a job as a research assistant that pays $30,000 per year. My parents offered to let me move in with them and live with them rent-free while I pay off my student loans. This seems to me to be a good deal and I accepted it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I have been putting all of the money I earn from my job toward my student loans in an aggressive attempt to pay them off. Is this the wisest choice? I wonder if I should put some of my money into a retirement or other savings account instead of putting all of it into student loans. My employer offers a 401(k) plan, but is not currently offering any matches because of a budget deficit. Is it worth putting money into a 401(k) anyway? Thanks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Julie Meadows, Boston</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. KOBLINER You've made a smart choice living with your parents. I did that, too, the first year I was out of school, for that same reason: paying off student loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It sounds as if you may have some private student loans, which often carry much higher interest rates (easily 14 or 15 percent) compared with federal student loans. (Stafford loans charge 6.8 percent.) If that's the case, pay off high-rate private loans as fast as you can. Paying off a loan that charges you 14 percent is the equivalent of earning 14 percent on your money guaranteed after taxes. That's a great investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You may want to consider switching to income-based repayment (which calculates your monthly payment by taking a fixed percentage of your salary) or stretching out the term of your Stafford and other federal student loans to 20 or 30 years to free up more cash. I would then split that extra money and use half of it to pay off your high-rate private loans more quickly and put the other half into a Roth I.R.A.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'd skip the 401(k) without a match. The reason: You can withdraw Roth I.R.A. contributions at any time, whether that's for emergencies or even to get a place of your own when the time comes. Good luck. You're definitely on the right track.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.I've got $3,500 in a Target 2050 retirement Roth I.R.A., $3,000 in certificates of deposit that will mature in a year, and $3,000 in a regular savings account. I make about $8,000 a year (parents/financial aid help with rent and major bills) and have no credit card debt or student loans, and I save or invest 25 percent of all my income. I'll be graduating college in a year and am planning on going for a Ph.D. afterward. In my field, doctoral students get a $17,000 to $25,000 stipend (plus tuition and health insurance) annually. So I won't have loans, though I won't have much disposable income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My financial needs for the next couple years include saving for a down payment, paying for part of a (modest) wedding, and potentially getting a car, in addition to continuing to build wealth and save for retirement. I feel like I am in pretty good shape, but I want to know how I can best take advantage of my situation to achieve the goals I mentioned. Also, if I need a car during graduate school, I'm loath to get a car loan. I've heard different opinions: Should I buy a used or cheap car out of pocket, or should I lease?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">M., Philadelphia</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. SETHI This is a great example of one of the most important differences between rich people and non-rich people: Rich people plan for things before they need them, while others are caught treading water when something bad happens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You're doing a great job already. Now, one of the most astonishing things in personal finance is how much the next 10 years of your life will cost you. Looking down the road, you'll have a wedding, kids, a house, a car, vacations, and maybe even some large unexpected expenses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let's take an example of how much a wedding costs. We know the average amount and average ages when people get married. So here's what you ''should'' be saving:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At age 20, you should be saving $333 per month for your wedding -- even if you're not engaged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you start saving at age 25, you should be saving $1,167 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(And remember, we all love to say we'll have a simple wedding. But they always seem to grow more than we expect.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The point is not to freak you out with those numbers, but to encourage you to write down the three to five most important expenses in the next five to 10 years, set up sub-savings account, and begin automatically saving for them. The sooner you save, the less you need to put away each month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In terms of a car, don't ever lease. It's almost always a bad decision. I've written about buying a new car, but in your situation I'd find a reliable used car. Ideally, you can save for it, but if not, a low-interest car loan isn't the worst thing in the world. Just remember to factor in phantom costs like gas, insurance, registration, and maintenance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One last thing: When it comes to saving, most people think it's all about cutting down and saying, ''No, no, no.'' No, I can't buy those lattes. No, I can't afford those jeans. No, forget about vacation. But remember the C.E.O. Model: Cut costs, Earn more, and Optimize your spending. As a Ph.D. student, you'll have a lot of time (and great skills) to try to earn more money. When you do, you'll be able to hit those major goals for the future. And instead of money being about saying ''no,'' it will be about figuring out how to say ''yes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. KOBLINER Wow. You sound like a together guy. First off, definitely get a used car. No question about that. Leasing is for someone who wants to drive a fancy new car to impress others. That's not you. There are a lot of car sites out there, but <span class="companylink">Edmunds.com</span> is one of the best places to start.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My advice is to keep filling the Roth I.R.A. with up to $5,000 a year in earned income if you can do it. (The stipend will probably count as earned income. Help from your parents probably won't.) You'll be able to tap this money for any of your near-term goals, and if you don't use it, it'll keep building up tax-free for your retirement. I'm not a huge fan of the target funds because I'd prefer you put half your money in the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index fund and divide the rest between a money fund and the Vanguard Total Bond Market Index fund -- simply because the expenses are lower. But there are worse things you could be buying. If you're getting a full ride, it sounds as if the school isn't going to expect you to contribute much of your short-term savings to graduate school costs. So that's good. If that's true, go ahead and keep saving any extra money beyond that $5,000 a year in the bank. (Monitor bankrate.com for the best rates out there.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.My husband is graduating this June and he is finishing his medical training (fellowship).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We are planning on putting away $16,500 pretax through his salary (I already put away money through my salary) beginning this summer, when he starts his new job. I've briefly read about post-tax Roth I.R.A.'s but am not sure how much we can put away post tax. So, how much can he put away for retirement post tax? Is it a percentage of his salary? If he puts away the maximum pretax, does this limit how much he puts away post-tax in an I.R.A.?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You also caution on purchasing a house. We are planning to purchase a condo next year. Most recommendations I hear and read are that your mortgage should not be more than 38 percent of your gross income. We want to purchase a condo that would cost 25 to 30 percent of his net income. Is this a sound plan? Or does this put us in a higher tax bracket? We don't want to be house poor and we don't need/want a large place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Claudia, Boston</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. KOBLINER It's great to hear that you plan to max out your 401(k) contributions this year. Beyond that, you can each contribute up to $5,000 (in post-tax money) a year into a Roth I.R.A. as long as your combined married adjusted gross income is under $166,000. (Contributing to a 401(k) may affect your eligibility to contribute to a deductible I.R.A., but for a Roth, it's just about how much you make.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders look at your gross income because it's easier for them to verify. At the moment, they want to see your total monthly housing costs (mortgage plus property tax and insurance) come in at around 28 to 33 percent of your monthly gross income. I checked with my favorite mortgage source, Keith Gumbinger at HSH.com, and if payments on the condo would be 25 to 30 percent of just your husband's net income (which will be lower than gross, and isn't even factoring in yours), you should be comfortably within that threshold, with room to spare. But there's no real reason why you should bite off any more of a home than you need or want.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Why should I invest in mutual funds and stocks, when you either have to be high up in the corporate structure, run a mutual fund or work at it 8 hours a day as a trader to make it work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most people get taken to the cleaners. People are stupid!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The game is rigged, yet most people are dumb as door nails.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thanks,</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark in Canada</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. NIPP A passively managed fund is cheaper and mostly follows an index. An actively managed fund has people who research the investments for you. There are many advantages to investing in stocks and mutual funds. The first is the rate of return. There are few other investments that receive better returns. Some safer, easier to understand investments barely keep up with inflation. The nice thing about mutual funds is that they have managers. You can choose between funds with passive or active managers. Then, you don't have to be a day trader or investment wizard to keep up with what is going on. They do all the work for you. Individual stocks are a little different. They do not have managers so if you decide to invest in individual stocks it would take more financial knowledge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. KOBLINER Hey Mark, you hit on something most people are too squeamish to address. There's no question that it's hard for the ''little guy'' to beat the market. Some argue that it's impossible. Just check out Burton Malkiel's excellent book, ''A Random Walk Down Wall Street'' for a lucid explanation of why you're right about playing the market. But if you're talking about investing over a long period of time, it's still the best guess of many experts that stocks, and especially stock mutual funds with low expenses and high diversification, are the way to go for at least some of your money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you look back over the last eight decades, stocks have substantially outperformed bonds and savings accounts. Even considering last year's terrible performance, large-cap stocks delivered an average annual return of 9.8 percent since 1926; long-term government bonds returned only 5.6 percent and ''cash'' or Treasury bills returned 3.7 percent. That's barely above the long-term average inflation rate of 3 percent. If you'd kept all your money in bank savings accounts, inflation would have weakened its buying power. (In effect, you would have made only 0.7 percent or so on your money.) True, there have been long periods (like the last 10 years) when stocks have not done well. But most experts feel that over long periods of time, you want some of your money in stocks. Of course, there are no guarantees. The only thing you can do, if you're willing to take some risk for the potential of higher gains, is to minimize the expenses of investing (don't trade a lot; don't pay commissions; go with low-cost index funds) and maximize any tax-favored plans (401(k)s, I.R.A.s, 529s).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. SETHI You're right that most people make catastrophic (and stupid) mistakes with their investments. And today, I would like to take the opportunity to mock them all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But before I do, let me emphasize that simple low-cost investing works. The quiet, boring people who read John Bogle, the founder of the Vanguard Group, and my book get better returns than portfolio managers on Wall Street. Yet it's sexier to invest in hedge funds and alternative assets than slow, long-term investing, isn't it? The game isn't rigged. As individual investors, we just pick the wrong arena to play in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So if that's true, why are we all in such poor financial shape?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sure, we can blame Wall Street, which uses sophisticated tricks like survivorship bias and incubator funds to hide the real performance of their (mostly terrible) funds. And yes, I hate every media article called ''The Best Stocks for 2009.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We can blame our education system, our government, and even our parents for not teaching us this -- and I love to blame everybody -- but there's one group of people who are primarily responsible for our financial problems: ourselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all the people who complain about macroeconomic policy and President Obama and Wall Street, have you ever picked up one good personal finance book? Have you ever rebalanced your investments, or learned what diversification really means? We love to complain, but knowing that our No. 1 worry throughout life will be money, how much time do we spend watching ''The Hills'' versus learning about money?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's what you need to know in 47 words: I call it the Hierarchy of Investing. Max out your 401(k) to the employer match. Then pay off debt. Then max out your Roth I.R.A.. Then go back to your 401(k) and continue maxing it out. Still have money left over? Open a taxable account. In all cases, invest in low-cost target-date funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In short, open the right accounts. Pick a simple, low-cost investment. Funnel as much money as possible into it. Automate your money. And get on with your life -- rich isn't just about money, but about living a rich life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.I am a recent college graduate of the class of 2008. Although I am compensated well for my position, my company does not offer a 401(k). I graduated with over $20,000 of student loans with interest rates ranging from 4.2 percent variable to 6.8 percent fixed. My strategy has been to save a buffer amount (approximately $8,000) in an online savings account making 1.55 percent interest, and then pour the rest of what I can save (which averages around $1,000 per month) into paying off the student loans, starting with the ones at higher interest rates. I am now down to a little over $8,000 in student loans. Should I continue this strategy? If so, what do I do once I've paid it all off, and if not, what should I be doing instead, keeping in mind that I may end up applying to graduate programs for Fall 2010? I've heard of a Roth I.R.A., but that's about as far as my knowledge goes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anonymous</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. NIPP Your current strategy sounds very well thought out. It is close to what I would have recommended. It is important to start off with an emergency fund in case of large unexpected expenses. Especially when you are trying to pay down debt, an emergency could put you back in the hole just as bad as or worse than where you started.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After you get your loans paid off, you may want to start putting your money into a Roth I.R.A. Most of the time, when you make a withdrawal from an I.R.A. before you are 591/2, you are charged a 10 percent penalty tax, but in some cases that penalty is waived as may be the case for a higher education expense. If you put money into a Roth I.R.A. you could save for both retirement and/or your education. If you decided to take out loans for your education, the money would be saved toward retirement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. KOBLINER You already uttered the magic words: Roth I.R.A.s. These make sense for all kinds of reasons. First, if you invest $1,000 a year for the next 10 years in a Roth and stop, that money can easily grow into almost $200,000 by the time you retire. (I'm guessing you're around 22.) Due to the advantages of tax-free compounding, starting young offers a huge payback. (In fact, if you wait and start at age 32 and then saved for 30 years, you'd actually end up with only $154,000.) Plus, the money's easy to get to if you need it before you retire; you can withdraw every dollar you contribute at any time, for any reason, without penalty or taxes. (The interest is off limits until retirement, unless you're willing to pay a penalty and taxes.) Finally, putting money in an I.R.A. may shield it from the financial aid process if you're going to graduate school. Some schools don't factor in retirement savings when they assess your ability to cover tuition and fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The interest on your student loans is probably tax deductible. So if your combined interest rate is about 5 percent, after the tax break that comes to about 3.5 percent. You have to ask yourself: Can you get better than 3.5 percent guaranteed after tax by investing in an I.R.A.? Although Roth I.R.A.s don't guarantee that, the tax advantages are so impressive that it's worth the gamble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. SETHI In a single sentence: It's working for you, so keep it up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You're actually a great example of the 85 Percent Solution: Getting 85 percent of the way is good enough, and then you can get on with your life. Too many of us think we have to get everything right before we get started: ''I need to get all my accounts together and the logins/passwords and figure out my investing goals and tweak my asset allocation and. ...'' Of course, the result is usually the same: We do nothing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Getting 85 percent of the way there is better than doing nothing at all. You're doing it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You've paid off $12,000 in loans and you'll pay off the rest in about eight months. That's excellent. I'd stay on track and start planning for what you'll do with that extra $1,000 once the debt is paid off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since your work doesn't offer a 401(k), max out your Roth I.R.A. up to $5,000 -- assuming you're under the income limit -- and then open up a regular taxable investment account. You can do this at Vanguard, <span class="companylink">T. Rowe Price</span>, <span class="companylink">TIAA-CREF</span>, etc. In both accounts, you'll be able to invest in anything you want. I'd encourage you to look at my earlier recommendation for lifecycle funds (also known as target-date funds). The only difference is this: a taxable account won't have the same tax advantages as a Roth I.R.A. or 401(k).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's O.K. As I mentioned with the 85percent Solution, it's better to open a taxable account and continue investing than to get overwhelmed by choices and do nothing at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.I graduated law school last June and was one of those unfortunate individuals who was ''laid off'' before I even started working. I fortunately found a job at a rising firm in Long Island, but currently is so new I had to ask for health insurance. Since it is so small. they do not offer retirement saving plans or any other perks that my friends are getting at larger firms/companies. I would like to start saving but I also have $150,000 law school debt, which I am paying off plus more per month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Should I start saving money for retirement. If so, where should I put my money to reap the best benefits? Or should I just take all of the extra money I have left at the end of the month and put it into paying off my student loans faster?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anonymous, Long Island</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. NIPP If I were you, my first goal would be to create an emergency fund. It is important to have some money saved in case of large unexpected expenses. After creating an emergency fund, I would start to pay down your student loans, beginning with the ones with the highest interest rates first. After you have paid down your loans and have some left over money each month, you can start to save for retirement. Because you are young and your employer does not offer any retirement accounts, I would suggest investing in a Roth I.R.A.. You will deposit after-tax money in this account, but all your distributions will be tax-free. Right now, you are probably in a fairly low tax bracket and can take advantage of this type of account. After you start making more money, you may be over the income limit to invest in a Roth I.R.A.. In 2009, for single taxpayers the amount you can contribute starts to decrease when you make $105,000 and you can no longer contribute if you make over $120,000. At this point you can start a traditional I.R.A. and/or start contributing to your employer's (hopefully) retirement accounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. KOBLINER If it helps, know that you're not alone. In the last couple of months, I've met dozens of new graduates who've had job offers rescinded or postponed. It's good news that you found something.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My answer to your question depends on the interest rates on your law school loans. Because of your huge volume of debt, I assume you have some private student loans in the mix. While federal loans like Staffords charge a somewhat attractive 6.8 percent, your private loans could easily be 14 or 15 percent. If you have rates in this range and you're wondering whether to save for retirement or dedicate the money to paying your debt, you need to ask yourself: Can saving earn me more that 14 or 15 percent guaranteed after taxes? The answer is no. I.R.A.s are a nice savings option for you thanks to the tax advantages, but if you have high-rate private loans, you have to deal with those as fast as you can.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One idea: Split the difference. Dedicate half your spare money to paying off high-rate loans and put the rest into a Roth I.R.A.. For low-rate federal student loans, it may make sense to extend the term of the loans. This will reduce the monthly payments and free up more cash to pay off the high-rate private loans. Depending on how much you're making, switching to income-based repayment may make sense for your federal loans. Check out http://www.finaid.org/calculators/ibr.phtml[http://www.finaid.org/calculators/ibr.phtml] to see if it makes sense for you.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. SETHI The technical answer: If you are an emotional robot (as I am), assuming your student loan is lower than 8 percent, you can simply go with the math and pay the minimum off and invest the rest. For example, if your student loan is 5 percent and we know you can make roughly 8 percent in the market over the long term, then it makes sense to pay the minimum on your student loan and invest the rest in low-cost funds (ideally target-date funds). If it's 7.5 or 8 percent, then it's a wash and we move on to the next choice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The emotional answer: Some people absolutely hate debt. So in this case, you'd pay off your debt first, then move on to investing. I had a friend in a similar situation who wanted to get rid of debt as fast as possible -- and no arguments about investing for the long term would work with him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But emotions matter. If you feel uncomfortable having your law school debt and want to get rid of it as quickly as possible, then trust your gut and pay it off. The minute your personal finance system becomes oppressive is the minute you stop using it. Just realize that paying off low-interest debt may cost you in future investment earnings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hybrid answer: In this situation, you take part of your money and pay off your student loans (always paying at least the minimum), and use the rest for investments. By investing early, you can get the benefits of compound interest. Most people will simply choose a 50/50 split to keep things simple, but if you're more aggressive, you can invest more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In terms of investing, open a Roth I.R.A. at a company like Vanguard, <span class="companylink">T. Rowe Price</span>, or <span class="companylink">TIAA-CREF</span>. A simple target-date fund is easy to choose. And remember, you can always withdraw the amount that you contribute to your Roth I.R.A., penalty-free, in case you need the cash. Over the next few years, you'll want to build up an emergency fund, set up a Conscious Spending Plan and automate your money. But for now, you're doing exactly the right things.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.I've been reading about this credit card bill that was passed, and there does not seem to be anyone answering this question. I'm a sixteen year old currently in the foster system. When I turn eighteen, I will age out of the foster system. Will I be able to get a credit card without a parent on the account? As I have no parents in the legal sense, what am I and others in my situation supposed to do?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Samantha</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. KOBLINER You'll be able to get a card as long as you can either prove to the card companies that you have the ''independent means to make the payments'' -- which means a job with an income that meets the card company's standards -- or can find someone 21 or older who's willing to be liable for your debt. If you want more details, please send me a message on my site (bethkobliner.com) and I'll look into it further for you. Once you get a credit card, be sure you use it for convenience only. Pay it off in full each month. And the only way to do that is to not buy items you can't afford. This will help you establish good credit and start your adult financial life on the right foot. This is really important.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Hello. At 22, I wish I'd known that good salaries, degrees, and job titles don't secure you financially. Steady jobs with benefits are rare and short lived (given business downsizing, mergers, and bubbles). I try to live within my means and work hard, but gaps in employment wipe out my savings. Financial advice seems stuck in the 1950s, assuming everybody has a steady job with benefits. Is financial planning really possible in our increasingly turbulent employment environment?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike Robinson</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. NIPP I think now is a time that financial planning is needed more than any other time in recent history. It is easy to plan for yourself when everything is going exactly as it should. Financial planners can be there to help you think of ideas that you haven't thought of and lead you through the rough patches. If nothing ever went, wrong then there would be less of a need for planners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. KOBLINER This may sound corny, but the turbulent employment environment means financial planning is no longer an option. It's a requirement. Though it's tempting in tight times to just give up on saving, having some money tucked away is critical in case of job loss. Where do you get the money to save? Cut expenses. Sometimes that's the only way. And then, really know the hierarchy of savings options, so you make the most of every penny.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's how: If you're lucky enough to be in a job with benefits, your first cash priority is to take full advantage of the matching plan offered by your company's 401(k). That's free money, and it's the best possible investment/savings plan out there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If a 401(k) with matching is not available to you, use any spare cash you can regularly pull together to chip away at high-rate credit card debt. That's not saving, you say? It is. If you have a credit card with an interest rate of 14 percent, paying off that debt is equivalent to earning 14 percent on your money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No credit card debt? Funnel a small amount each month directly into a Roth IRA (available to you if you earn less than six figures). If you should find yourself in a situation where you need this cash for living expenses, you can get it, penalty free. And if you don't end up needing it, it will grow tax free till you access it for retirement. (More details at www.bethkobliner.com[http://www.bethkobliner.com].) To start an IRA by automatically setting aside $50 a month, go to <span class="companylink">T. Rowe Price</span> (www.trowe.com[http://www.trowe.com]). By the end of 2010, you'll have enough to switch to Vanguard's STAR fund (www.vanguard.com[http://www.vanguard.com]), where the fees are lower but the account minimum is $1,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.My 24-year-old daughter is attending graduate school to get an M.F.A. in theater. She has never had a credit card. She does get a stipend from her school, and student loans are in her name. What is the best way for her to develop a decent credit rating?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sherry Kirschenbaum</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">West Orange, N.J.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. NIPP Sherry, there are many ways to develop credit other than credit cards and you have mentioned a few. Any time a financial commitment is in your name, it affects your credit rating. This includes bills, loans, etc. It is important to make sure that you are responsible about these commitments. You can look on the Internet at the different variables that make up a credit rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. KOBLINER The only way to get a good credit rating is to borrow money and pay it back on time, over and over. If your daughter has started paying back her undergraduate loans, she's beginning to establish her credit score. If those loans are deferred while she's in graduate school, it makes sense for her to get a credit card in her own name. It's your job as a parent to put the Fear of FICO in her. Hammer it into her head in any way you can that she should use the card reasonably and pay off the balance each month. She should think of her credit card as a tool for establishing a great credit score, rather than one for buying things she can't afford. If she doesn't get it, hit her with this example: If she charges $1,000 on her credit card but only makes the minimum monthly payment, it would take her 12 years and more than $1,800 in total payments to kill that $1,000 debt. But if she pays off her balance each month, she'll never pay a penny in interest and will build excellent credit in the process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. SETHI The simplest way to build credit is to pay her loans on time, and to get a credit card and use it responsibly. Many people feel guilty about their $3 coffee or $5 cab rides, but neglect to focus on good credit, which saves tens of thousands of dollars over the long term. For example, when I bought my first car, my credit was excellent, but I didn't have enough sources of credit, so the higher interest rate ended up costing me over $2,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While bad credit will hurt your finances, so will having no credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's how your credit score is calculated (from myfico.com):</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">35 percent: Payment history. How reliable you are. Late payments hurt you.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">30 percent: Amount owed. How much you owe and how much of your credit you've used.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">15 percent: Length of history, or how long you've had credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">10 percent: New credit. Older accounts are better because they show you're reliable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">10 percent: Types of credit (for example, credit cards, student loans).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why is credit important? Let's say your daughter will someday buy a house that costs $300,000. If she has excellent credit, she'll save more than $10,000 per year on her mortgage compared with someone with poor credit. While her friends are wringing their hands over the $2.50 Cokes they order when eating out, your daughter will be focusing on building her credit, which is of the biggest wins she can target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Note: If your daughter can't get a credit card because she doesn't have enough credit, ask for a ''secured credit card,'' which will help her get started.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although we love to point to credit cards as convenient villains (and they are -- nobody hates credit card companies more than I do), they are simply the most convenient way to build your credit score.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. I'm a university student with one year of study left. A few years ago, I got a student credit card for emergencies and to build up credit history, on the advice of a family member. I always paid off the minimum balance, paid off the full balance within the grace period and used my credit card responsibly. In mid-2006 I left the country for a brief vacation (I'm an international student in Canada), which turned into 22 months for unavoidable reasons. Unfortunately, when I left, there was a balance on my credit card. And although I tried to pay off as much as I could, I wasn't able to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now I'm back in Canada and I'd like to pay off my balance, get a new card (too late to renew the old account) and continue with life. However, it appears that my credit history is now ruined. I hadn't realized how pervasive the issue of ''credit history'' in North America is. Can I get this cleared from my credit file?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jina</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. KOBLINER Jina, I'm sorry to hear this happened to you, and I'm afraid there's no way to clear your credit report overnight. You can fix things, but it takes time. The first thing to keep in mind is that you should ignore companies that claim to repair your credit for you. They're costly and useless.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Your first task is to begin paying off that old credit card. Whether it takes months, years or decades to complete the payments, it's the only way to rectify your situation. After about a year of on-time payments, you should see significant improvement in your credit score; it could jump by as much as 75 points. Check next year at this time by getting your credit score at www.equifax.ca[http://www.equifax.ca] and www.transunion.ca[http://www.transunion.ca] (for readers in the United States, go to www.myfico.com[http://www.myfico.com]). It costs about $23 to $24 in Canadian dollars for each score ($16 in the United States).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for your current financial life, don't apply for any credit cards right now. Stick with cash. A recent M.I.T. study found that people spend half as much when they stick with cash as they do using cards. So it's just a smart habit. Set yourself up to stay on top of bills by signing up for automatic payment. And if money is tight and you're tempted to make only the minimum payment each month on that big credit card bill, force yourself to pay a little more. Why? If you owe $5,000 and make only the minimum payment, it will take you 29 years and $6,555 in interest to eliminate that debt. Pay just $10 more per month and that debt will be gone in five years and you will have paid $2,166 in interest, which means $4,000 more for you.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Your column on financial planning for college students prompted me to pose a question that I have had difficulty answering, even though I am a college professor, not a student:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How can I tell what is the appropriate percentage of my income to ideally spend on various, particularly unfixed, costs?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, I think of myself as a thrifty grocery shopper. But that is a relative value, and I can't really determine that for sure until I know what the average percentage of income a middle-class couple, no children, spends per week or month on food (exclusive or inclusive of restaurants).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, for even more discretionary leeway -- what percentage of income should I be spending annually on my clothes? Sometimes, when I want to buy something, I can't tell if it is a reasonable expenditure, because I don't spend much on clothes, or is extravagant, because it seems more expensive than I usually pay for such an item. It would help to know what other people, such as middle-age professional women, feel is an appropriate percentage of income to spend on clothes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I know a lot of these depend on individual values, income level, savings amount and rates of savings (20 percent of our modest incomes), debts (none except mortgage), etc. but nevertheless, having a ballpark percentage of how other people in similar circumstances distribute their income would ease my apprehensions of either being ''pathologically frugal'' (per husband) or excessively self-indulgent (he doesn't know how much I spent on that sweater).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is there a guide somewhere to this?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thank you,</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suzaan Boettger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jackson Heights, N.Y.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. NIPP Suzaan, everyone has a different opinion of what are appropriate spending habits. There is not one answer for everyone. The first step in figuring out a budget is to determine your after-tax take-home pay. Once you know that, you can subtract all your fixed expenses and find out how much money you have left. You will use this money to invest/save and spend on your variable expenses. It is recommended that you save around 15 percent of your salary. You can use the leftover money for other expenses. This should give you a good idea of how much you can spend on variable expenses. Another factor to a budget is determining what is important to you. If you really enjoy buying nice clothes, then you may decide that you would rather eat at home instead of a restaurant and save the money for a nice outfit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. KOBLINER Leave it to a woman from Queens to ask such a great question (I grew up in Bayside). According to the Census Bureau, the typical American household spends 27 percent of its after-tax income on housing, 10 percent on food, and 3 percent on clothes; Census figures on just professionals reveal spending of 3 percent on clothing and 8 percent on food. (You can convert your own expenses into income percentages on my site, www.bethkobliner.com[http://www.bethkobliner.com].)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're saving 20 percent of your income, which is great, make sure at least half of that is in retirement accounts. The next priority is to keep nine months of living expenses in an easy-access location like a bank account or money fund. Once you have all this in order, give yourself permission to buy any sweater you want, in your two favorite colors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. SETHI Good news. There are two ways to do this:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, you can use Mint.com to see what other people in similar situations are spending. (Here's an example: Compare auto spending for people who live in San Francisco.) Mint is one of my favorite online personal finance applications, and it allows you to manage your accounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next, here's a very rough idea of how much 20-somethings should be spending. This is from chapter 4 of my book, ''I Will Teach You To Be Rich.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">50 to 60 percent of take-home pay: Fixed costs (rent, utilities, debt, etc)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">10 percent: Investments like a 401(k) or Roth IRA</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">5 to 10 percent: Savings (vacations, gifts, house down payment, unexpected expenses)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">20 to 35 percent: Guilt-free spending (eating out, going out, clothes, etc.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These numbers are just a rough guide, but I am serious about spending extravagantly on the things you love, and cutting costs mercilessly on the things you don't. For example, if you've hit your savings and investing goals and you want to buy $250 jeans, great. Go for it. On the other hand, if I catch a father of three at the club spending 35 percent of his take-home pay going out, I might have to beat him with an onion (that way, it's unclear why he's crying).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And remember, if you're not hitting your savings or investing goals, you can use the C.E.O. model -- Cut costs, Earn more and Optimize your spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. My recently graduated-from-college daughter is taking a year off from school, living in Washington, D.C., with girlfriends while working at a low-paying job, with plans to attend graduate school in a year for a career in occupational therapy. While this is a growing field, and many employers offer tuition reimbursements as recruitment tools, my daughter will most likely accumulate student loan debt. What suggestions do you have for her in getting loans for graduate school and repaying those loans, and what is the state of graduate school loans in this economy?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Susan from Dallas, Tex.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. KOBLINER So glad you asked this one! Occupational therapy is a great field and you're right; she may be able to get help from her employer when she graduates. In the meantime, it's important that your daughter borrows in the smartest way that she can.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, some back story on this. For the last decade or so banks have not only been doling out crummy subprime mortgages but they've also been shoving equally crummy private education loans down the knowledge-thirsting throats of undergraduates and graduates students alike.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These private loans are very, very expensive, often charging 13 or 14%. That's about the same as many credit cards. But starting in 2006, graduate students were allowed to pay for all of their graduate school with federal student loans. Your daughter needs to fill out the FAFSA form and then take out all the Stafford loans that she can. Once she's maxed out of Staffords, she can get the new Grad Plus loan for the rest of the money she needs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Please, please, please make sure she asks her financial aid office at her school for these federal loans and does not end up with the private loans often peddled alongside them. Banks are still pushing those pricier student loans because they make more money on them. There may also be ways she can defer her loans (meaning putting off repayment) if she ends up working in a low-income area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, please make sure that she doesn't rack up credit card debt on this year off in Washington. It's the mother in me, but I would hate for her to build up $10,000 or so in credit card debt without thinking about it. I've toured the country and met hundreds of 20-somethings that have done just that. Tell her that if she does rack up debt, it will likely take her until her 40s, or even 50s, to pay it off (and make it clear you're not going to help with it if she does). It's so much better to have this talk now than at the end of the year when she's drowning in credit card debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One final note: After she graduates, she will probably be able to deduct the interest on her student loans up $2,500 a year. But she can't do it if she fills out the EZ tax form. So she should fill out the 1040A or 1040 instead. This will sound like alphabet soup to her now, but hold onto this and show it to her after graduation. It would be the equivalent of a many-hundred dollar graduation present! (Shameless plug: All of this is in Get a Financial Life on page 50 to 58.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Good luck!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Just a quick question, I'm will be entering law school this fall. I am 25 years old with just about $10,000 in savings. I have no investments, nor a retirement savings account such as a 401(k). My question is this: Can I even think about saving for my retirement at this point? Should I stop feeling guilty if I can't? I plan on going about $80,000 into debt with my school bills during the next three years. I have been trying to save for the past couple of years with the intention of using my savings for law school.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I was raised in a household where saving for one's retirement was emphasized. Furthermore, it seems that saving for one's retirement gets a lot of attention from financial planners. I already scrimp and save and consider myself to be extremely frugal - almost to a fault. I don't think I can cut many more corners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thanks,</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Caroline Nasella</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. NIPP Yes, the earlier you start saving for retirement the more years the money has to compound and grow into a nice lump sum. But stop feeling guilty! The fact that you have good habits right now and that you are thinking about saving for retirement tells me that you know how important it is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think that as long as you start saving when you start working you should have plenty of time to build a nest egg for yourself. When you finish law school, you will hopefully be making a good salary and be able to pay off your student loans and save for retirement at the same time. The fact is, you will probably still be ahead of many people your age.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. KOBLINER You are a marvel to even ask this question. But I'm not sure if you will like my answer. It's amazing that you've saved $10,000. Could you put half of that into a Roth IRA this year? Let me explain why.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, when you apply for loans to law school, the school may not expect you to contribute your retirement savings to tuition, so you'd be better off putting it there. Second, if you put $5,000 into an IRA now and never contribute anything more (I'm assuming you're 25 perhaps?), you'd have $ 105,000 by age 65 (assuming an 8 percent rate of return). That's the magic of tax-free compounding for many, many years that gets financial planners all excited. It's been called the eighth wonder of the world (at least by a few accountants I dated in my twenties...).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other thing about a Roth IRA is that you can withdraw what you've contributed without paying taxes or penalties. A lot of people don't know this. So while ideally it will sit there earning interest tax-free until you're ready to retire, you *can* get at it without too much bother if you need it. If you're really nervous about losing any of that money in the short-term, you can invest a Roth IRA in money market funds or even bank CDs for the next couple of years as you make your way through law school. Once you're out, you can switch a portion of it to stock index funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for your scrimping and saving, don't ruin your life but do know that it's very, very smart to be careful with your money. When all your friends who are using credit cards with reckless abandon reach their 30s and are still paying them off, you'll be able to do the things you want to do (Buy a home? Start a family? Take a trip to Bali?).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keep up the good work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. I just recently graduated from Georgia Tech with a Bachelor's in Nuclear Engineering and I respectfully disagree with Ms. Nipp's advice to not buy a home. The situation is different for everyone when they get out of college. On average, it is probably true that most recent college graduates cannot afford a home, but I can say confidently that I am living proof as an exception.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I will be closing on a townhome in Charlotte, N.C., and this will become a significant investment. If you have the money for a down payment and can make the monthly payments (taxes and insurance included) on a townhome I do not see the big deal. Townhomes also do not have the upkeep expense. You just pay $100/per month or so for a homeowners association fee. Thus, it's a good option for first time home buyers. An F.H.A. loan only requires 3% down payment, and if a college student just saves a little bit of money during four plus years of school or even beginning in high schoo, then he or she could easily afford to buy a place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Madison, please let me know your thoughts on this. I definitely do not have the finance experience you do. Just basing everything on my situation and using some logic. Thanks.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atlanta, Georgia</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. NIPP Jordan, the point I was trying to make in the article is just to be aware of the costs that come along with owning a home. It sounds like you have done your research and you know what the costs will be and can afford them. Good for you!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. KOBLINER First, congratulations. That's amazing that you've been able to do this (then again, you're a nuclear engineer so as my mother would say, if not you Jordan, then who?) Anyway, I think you make a good point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But here's my question to you: did you buy a home that you think you'll live in for at least five years or more? If so, I completely agree with your assessment. Home prices are down in many areas, mortgage interest rates are at 4.8 percent, close to an all-time low, and thanks to the Obama stimulus package, you will get up to $8,000 back on your home purchase this year through a special tax break (as long as you earn less than $95 ,000 as a single person and less than $170,000 if you're married.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So yes Jordan, buying can be really, really smart right now. I do know of a few recent college graduates who are considering purchasing a studio apartment in New York, for example. While they may seem like bargains now, if they will outgrow these homes in two years (get married, have kids) then the closing costs, moving costs and home improvement costs they incur will probably make this a bad deal for them if they have to move in just a few years. But it sounds like you're buying a home that you can live in for a while. And if that's the case, I think it's wise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One point of information: The FHA now requires borrowers put down 3.5%, not 3% as you said above.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. SETHI As Yale economist Robert Shiller notes, ''...from 1890 through 1990, the return on residential real estate was just about zero.'' How can that be?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let's talk about homeownership in two ways: as an investment and as a lifestyle choice. You may not like my first answer: Real estate is one of the most overrated investments available. Although homeownership is a core part of the American dream, many people don't understand the invisible costs associated with buying a house, such as insurance, taxes, and maintenance fees. Now, as a lifestyle choice, owning real estate can be great for stability, raising a family, etc -- but I want to challenge you on both of these factors. Let's look closer at how real estate really works.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Renting is a perfectly reasonable alternative to buying, especially in our 20s, but we perpetuate a mistaken culture of homeownership. Our parents tell us to buy a house. Our friends are impressed if we own a house soon after graduating. The government literally encourages us to own a house by offering tax deductions. Homeownership is the American Dream!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, we've all heard our friends and parents say these things:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners get an amazing tax deduction</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can use leverage to grow your money quickly!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They're not building more land</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These are all addressed by Patrick Killelea on the excellent real-estate site patrick.net.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem is, we systematically forget to factor in the important expenses of owning a house like closing costs, maintenance, insurance, and taxes. I call these ''Phantom Costs'' because they're invisible to us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, you might be tempted to think, ''I'm paying $1,000/month for my apartment, so I can definitely afford $1,000 for a house and build equity!'' But once you factor in your phantom costs, your monthly mortgage will be closer to $1,500/month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New York Times itself wrote about this: In describing a Minneapolis retiree, they wrote:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''...He views the four-bedroom home he bought for $32,500 in 1965 - or about $200,000 in today's dollars - as a money tree. He and his wife recently listed it for $413,000. That would translate into an annual return of 1.2 percent, taking into account inflation and the cost of two new decks and an extra room. They plan to move to Texas after it has sold. ''I wish I'd bought more real estate,'' [he] said.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the sale sounds like a $380,000 profit on the surface, by digging in to the 1.2% return rate, you realize that the market would have returned over six times that amount if he'd put the money in other simple low-cost investments, with built-in diversification.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buying a house means you'll need a six month emergency fund in case you lose your job and can't pay your mortgage. It means you'll have to commit to staying in the same house for at least 10 years (better: 30). unless you want to lose tens of thousands of dollars in transaction costs. like closing and moving costs, if you sell any earlier. How many 20-somethings can commit to that? I know I can't.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are some good reasons to own, including stability and the freedom to change your house as you want. But it's critically important to understand where your money could be doing more for you -- and depending on where you live, it often makes more sense to rent while you save and invest aggressively in your twenties. You can find out more at The New York Times buy vs. rent calculator. As Consumer Reports recently noted, if you had an extra $100 to either pay off your 15-year mortgage or invest in the market, you'd be better served investing it 100% of the time. I cover all of this in more detail on my buying a house page.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. What about those of us who are still in school, or, as in my case, have gone back to school? How can we minimize the debt that we're going to come out with, beyond just minimizing our expenses?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If we have savings, should we use those towards tuition to minimize the amount of loans we take out, or should we rather take advantage of low(er) interest government loans and put our savings into mutual funds or an IRA? Once we've maximized the federal direct loans, should we look to commercial banks' student loan programs to cover the rest, or stick with government-backed PLUS loans?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, I understand that Congress passed a bill in 2007 that would forgive student debt after 10 years for those of us who work in the public interest. What are the limitations on this? How is ''public interest'' defined? Does it have to be government? Can you work abroad?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thanks,</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kelly E. Wells</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. KOBLINER You are just bursting with questions aren't you ? Okay, here I go.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The best way to look at these questions is to look at the numbers:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. Go with federal student loans. Federal student loans--whether Staffords (which charge 5.8% and may not accrue interest while you're in school) or the PLUS (which will accrue interest while you are in school and charge closer to 8%). These are almost always better than bank commercial loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2. Stick what you can into a Roth IRA this year. Okay, here's where we get into fuzzy math a bit. Your question was: should I pay tuition rather than put money into an IRA? The answer isn't crystal clear, but I think it makes sense to put the money in the IRA and here's why. If you put the money toward tuition, you are essentially not taking more of a student loan at 6.8%. So it's like you're paying off a loan that charges you 6.8%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, there are few places you can put your money, save for a 401(k) plan with an employer match, that guarantees you a 6.8% return after taxes. So that would suggest putting the money toward tuition. However, the interest you pay on loans for tuition may be deductible so it's more like earning half that, say 3%. Now I would say that although there is no guarantee that a Roth IRA will pay you more than 3% this year or next, I think the tax advantages you get for saving in a plan like a Roth IRA offer a good enough bet that you will do better than 3%. So my advice is put $5,000 into a Roth IRA if you can. If not, even just a couple of thousand is good. Then forget you put it there and ignore it for 30 years. You will thank me when you're 60!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And your last question: people working full-time in public service careers (such as law enforcement, public health, social work, many teaching jobs, etc.) may be able to get their remaining debt canceled after ten years of employment. You have to be in the federal Direct Loan Program or have consolidated your loans into it in order to take advantage of this perk. Although the rules don't say that work has to be done on U.S. soil, check out finaid.org for help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bottom line: take out federal student loans (first Staffords than PLUS), skip commercial bank loans, put some money in a Roth IRA and read the student loan section of my book or go to finaid.org for details on repayment plans. In addition to loan forgiveness for public service, you get breaks for joining the Peace Corps, working in economically depressed areas and in health care fields among others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. My main question about Roth I.R.A.'s is which is the most effective way to invest money in a Roth? Right now I have some Schwab funds in mine that are geared toward my target retirement date (eons away), but I wonder if that is the most effective decision?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Chance,</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">University of Georgia</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. SETHI: Target-date retirement funds (they're also called lifecycle funds) are the simplest and best investing option for the vast majority of people. Most people think that investing is about picking sexy stocks, bragging about them at parties and somehow enjoying the subsequent results of being fed grapes and being fanned with palm fronds within a few years. Not true.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I love these low-cost funds because they solve our No. 1 problem with investing: discipline. Individual investors should not pick stocks. You're not good at it, you'll fail to beat the market and you're subject to all kinds of cognitive errors that will dramatically reduce your return rate over the long term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Target-date retirement funds solve this problem by automatically rebalancing for you, which sounds as prosaic as my asking you to pass the salt but is extremely important: Your asset allocation (i.e., mix of stocks and bonds) makes up 90 percent or more of your portfolio's variability and is the single most important investing factor you can control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Your friends will try to convince you that target-date retirement funds aren't as high-returning and exciting as their fancy stocks (which they probably picked using a dartboard, three beers and a sponge cake). Ignore them. You're focused on growth, not impressing your friends, and these funds help with your growth goal without requiring you to become a portfolio manager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, when you're young, your target-date fund will have an aggressive asset allocation (nearly all stocks for most recent graduates). But as you get older, the fund will automatically rebalance to be more conservative. To put it bluntly, if many of the 50- and 60-year-olds in America had been using these funds, they never would have lost 50 percent of their money in the recent market turmoil, since their funds would have been more heavily weighted in bonds. Unfortunately, it doesn't pay for Wall Street to tell us this, since the fat fees are in other bloated mutual funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's an example of how asset allocation looks for various ages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Target-date funds are low-cost, automatic and exemplify what I call the 85 percent Solution: They get you 85 percent of the way there, so you can automate your investments and get on with your life. You pick the fund that corresponds to the year you'll retire (so if you're 22, that fund will probably be something like a 2050 fund). Once you select the fund (which you've already done), just focus on automatically funneling as much money as possible into it -- and enjoy doing more of the things you love, not worrying about your investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. KOBLINER: I'm not a huge fan of these target funds. The gimmick is that they are supposed to switch the mix as you get closer to retirement. Sounds nice, but the fact is, many people in their 60s who had these accounts still lost more than 25 percent last year! What's more, the annual expenses on the Schwab target funds for young people are 0.76 percent, which isn't awful but is higher than the expenses on some of the Vanguard funds that you might want to consider.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So if you get the Total Stock Market Index fund (0.18 percent in expenses) plus the Total Bond Market Index fund (0.22 percent in expenses) plus some money market funds (expenses of 0.28 percent), all from Vanguard, you'll pay much lower fees. In fact, you'd pay about 55 basis points (or 55 hundredths of a percentage point) less a year in fees with Vanguard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That may not sound like a lot, but over 40 years that gap can translate into a lot of money. If you put in $5,000 this year, assuming the same rate of return, the Schwab fund would pay you $105,000 and the Vanguard fund would pay $135,000. Of course no one can say for sure what the stock market will return -- or what a specific mutual fund will pay out -- but the one thing you can do to maximize your investment is to pay lower fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. NIPP: In general, when you are young you can afford to be more risky with your investments. This means that you can invest more in stocks than in bonds. Also, when you don't have a lot to invest or don't know much about investing, it is a good idea to put your money into mutual funds. Mutual funds are good way for investors to diversify their money, and they have managers who take care of the research for you. Another thought is that because a Roth I.R.A. grows tax free, you would want to invest your most highly taxed funds into this account.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q.Recent graduates get lots of advice about how to prepare for the long run financially. But what about those of us who need to save in the short term?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm thinking about (and speaking as) a recent college graduate who is working for a few years before heading back to professional school. For those of us who will need to draw upon most of our savings to pay for loans, books, etc. within another few years, what are the best means of putting away money safely to earn some interest but still retaining access to it a short while later?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Certificates of deposit, money-market savings accounts and bonds all come to mind. But are there any of these in particular that would be especially valuable or useful for an investor from this standpoint? I worry about Treasury securities as ratings companies begin to consider downgrading U.S. debt given the recession, deficit, enormous bailout programs, health care reform and looming Social Security insolvency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeff, New York City</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. KOBLINER: I hope you're thinking of going to business school. We could use some clear-thinking minds like yours! You ask a great question and here's your answer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think you should put $5,000 a year (or as much as you have) into a Roth I.R.A. every year. There are a few reasons for this. First, when you apply for financial aid for professional school, the federal form (FAFSA) does not consider money you have in retirement accounts when calculating how much you can contribute to your grad school bills. (Some schools ask you to raid your retirement accounts, but some do not.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Your school will expect you to use up a large part of the money you have outside of retirement plans for educational expenses. That's why Roth I.R.A.'s can be a very good choice in your situation. What's more, if you know you're going to need this money very soon, you can invest your Roth I.R.A. into really safe investments for now, like a money fund or a federally insured bank C.D. (Despite the sorry state of our nation's financial affairs, these are still the safest places to stash money that you're not willing to lose.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Roth I.R.A. rules say you can withdraw money you contribute to these plans for any reason without paying taxes or penalties. Ideally, you will leave your money in these plans to grow for your retirement, but if you're looking to put away money for goals that are two to four years away, a Roth makes sense.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. SETHI: I love the way you're thinking. For any major expenses or goals you have within five years, set up savings goals within your savings account -- you can even create sub-accounts. Here's how I do it:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, get a high-interest savings account. I like <span class="companylink">ING Direct</span> because it lets me create sub-accounts easily, but <span class="companylink">HSBC</span> and Emigrant Direct also come highly recommended from my blog readers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second, sit down and pick any savings goals. These might be major goals, like a trip abroad next year, or regular expenses like Christmas gifts. Let's dig into that one: In 2008, Americans spent an average of $431 on Christmas gifts. That's a hefty amount come December, but if you automatically save each month, that's only $36 each month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Examples: I like to include a ''stupid mistakes'' account, which lets me make up for any parking tickets or late fees that unexpectedly come up. Now that gas prices are relatively low, I'm actively hedging against gas prices going up. You'll also be astonished how much it costs to save for a wedding. Remember to include invisible payments that you don't normally think about, like health insurance and registration fees for your car.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's an example of how I've set up sub-savings accounts.Third, set up automation by using the Next $100 Principle: When you earn your next $100, where will it go? Think of your checking account as your e-mail in-box, and set up automatic transfers to move money to the appropriate places -- without your manual involvement. For example, you might take $5 of each $100 and put $1 toward a vacation, $3 toward a down payment on a house, and $1 toward buying a new iPhone. Each $100 that comes into your checking account will be automatically filtered to the right account. Here's a highly detailed overview of automating your accounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Note: Stop worrying about the Treasury and macro-economic policy questions. You can't control them. Let your friends debate minutiae while you focus on earning and saving as much as possible. Also, don't rate-chase (change accounts to get an extra 0.05 percent interest). Your time is better focused on setting up a few savings goals, saving relentlessly toward them and enjoying your hard work when you realize you can pay for your goals in full.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. I have several questions for you. I recently graduated from college and want to consolidate my student loans. Are lenders consolidating student loans right now? If so, which ones?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, I'm interested in a retirement plan, but I don't want to become like one of the Madoff victims. What should we know to help us prevent that situation?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Janice, Miami, Fla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. NIPP: Given the recent media coverage surrounding fraud and Ponzi schemes, it is scary to trust finance companies. Unfortunately, I don't have a magic eight ball to tell you which companies will end up like that. What I can tell you is that if your employer offers a 401(k), you are probably safe investing in it and that if an investment offers you returns that seem unreal, they probably are.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is important that you do your homework on the people you invest your money with. Many retirement accounts are with large, well-known firms that give you information about the funds and the holdings within those funds. If the company is not divulging information, consider it a bad sign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MS. KOBLINER: Congratulations! Instead of kicking back in sunny Miami you're thinking about student loan consolidation and individual retirement accounts. Brava!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So here's the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, you can consolidate. But there may not be a compelling reason to do so anymore. Here are the details. When you consolidate, you're basically combining all your different loans into one loan. This is surely convenient. But to do this, the consolidator takes the average interest and rounds up the rate to the nearest one-eighth of a percentage point. One advantage of consolidating is that it can make it easier for you to opt for a repayment plan -- such as extended repayment that means you can pay back your loans over 20 years rather than 10. To read more about consolidation see Finaid.org.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there's more to this story. For years, the key advantage of consolidation was that it allowed you to not only combine all your loans but also refinance them at a lower rate. Thanks to a rule that kicked in during the Bush administration, you can no longer refinance the federal loans you got after July 1, 2006. That stinks because prevailing interest rates have dropped a lot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you do have federal loans that you got before July 1, 2006, you may be able to refinance these, so make sure to check the Education department's Web site. As for loans you got after that date, you're stuck with them. Stafford federal loans, for example, are at 5.8 percent, which isn't horrible at all, and you'll have to live with that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for your Madoff nightmares, here's the deal: If you have a 401(k) at work, make sure to contribute as much as your employer will match. This is free money; no debates here. Beyond that, you might want to consider a Roth I.R.A. at a company like Vanguard, my favorite mutual fund company, which charges much lower fees than most others. Stick with the Total Stock Market Index fund, which charges 0.18 percent. That's about one-eighth of the average stock mutual fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider putting a chunk of it in that index fund, perhaps half or so, and then some in a medium-term index bond fund and the rest in money-market funds. Remember, Roth I.R.A.'s are called retirement accounts, but they allow you to withdraw money you contribute, for any reason, without having to pay penalties or taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The goal is to not touch it until your 60s, but if you do need to get at those funds to buy a house or pay for grad school, for example, a mix like this would ensure that at least some of it will always be there. If you need more specifics, feel free to send me questions at my Web site.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE poetry of the real estate listing may help to sell an apartment, but what matters most to buyers in this choppy market is the cold-blooded price. The best listings dangle a price designed to quicken the pulse of an uncertain buyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Appraisers and real estate agents sometimes spend years learning the fine points of estimating the value of an apartment, but these prices are guesswork at best -- especially so in a depressed market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With more sales information available on the Web, sellers may want to create their own market report, by gathering data on recent sales and competing listings. This can be a useful reality check when hiring a broker or, later, when considering an offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shaun Osher, a broker and the head of CORE Group Marketing, said that in this market, setting an asking price is like solving a jigsaw puzzle. ''You are taking bits of information and putting them together to create the big picture,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, compare your house or apartment with those that have recently sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Listings on Web sites like trulia.com, streeteasy.com, propertyshark.com and the real estate listings at nytimes.com provide a variety of tools to review recent sales in individual buildings or by neighborhood. Condominium and co-op boards or managing agents may be able to provide information as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Check to see if a similar apartment has recently sold in your building. Is that apartment on a higher floor; does it have a better view or a newer kitchen? If so, yours should have a lower price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you are comparing your apartment with one in another building, does your building have more amenities or a better location? If so, then your apartment might be worth more to buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In suburban neighborhoods, you might want to drive by houses that sold recently, comparing their curb appeal and their location with those of your own home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this market, the date of sale is particularly important. A property that sold last fall is likely to have sold for 20 percent more than it would sell for today. In most segments of the market, one recent sale is a better indicator than 10 sales in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You should also look at current listings, bearing in mind that these are prices that sellers are hoping to get, not necessarily what they will get. Most brokers say that the properties that sell are the ones with the lowest prices for what they have to offer.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite talk of stability and glimmers of recovery, the construction industry and home builders appear to be a long way from a rebound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home construction fell to its lowest pace on record in April, the government reported on Tuesday, disappointing forecasters, who had hoped for a modest increase. Building permits fell to record lows and construction on new multifamily units plunged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts were down 12.8 percent last month from March, to an annual pace of 458,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results showed that the housing market remained weak, even as home builders reported that they were regaining some confidence and as prices began to fall at a slightly slower pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's just simply too much supply on the market, and construction starts will have to continue to contract,'' said Joseph Brusuelas, director at Moody'sEconomy.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A glut of foreclosure properties also continues to flood the market, and many potential buyers are still hesitant to enter as unemployment continues to rise. The one bright spot was construction of single-family homes, which rose for a second month, this time by 2.8 percent to an annual pace of 368,000 units, the Commerce Department reported, even though they were down 45.6 percent from last year's levels. Construction of apartments and multifamily dwellings, however, plunged 42.2 percent for the month. Although data on multifamily construction is volatile, housing analysts said the drop in apartment and condominium construction reflected the excess supply and tight markets for construction loans on larger projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing permits fell less severely than housing starts, slipping 3.3 percent in April to an annual rate of 494,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said the stability in single-family construction was somewhat encouraging. ''These figures add to the evidence of potential stabilization in that part of the industry,'' Michael D. Larson, an analyst at Weiss Research, wrote in a research note.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a decade of growth, the gains made in homeownership by African-Americans and native-born Latinos have been eroding faster in the economic downturn than those of whites, according to a report issued Tuesday by the Pew Hispanic Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report also suggests that the gains for minority groups, achieved from 1995 to 2004, were disproportionately tied to relaxed lending standards and subprime loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An exception to the reversal of homeownership gains, the research shows, can be found among foreign-born Latinos, whose rate of ownership, while low, has stalled during the downturn but has not fallen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After peaking at 69 percent in 2004, the rate of homeownership for all American households declined to 67.8 percent in 2008. For African-American households, it fell to 47.5 percent in 2008 from 49.4 percent in 2004. Latinos, native and foreign-born together, had a longer period of growth, with homeownership rising until 2006, to 49.8 percent, before falling to 48.9 percent last year. Homeownership for native-born Latinos fell to 53.6 percent from a high of 56.2 percent in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline among whites was more modest, to 74.9 percent last year from 76.1 percent in 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So was the decline among immigrants, to 52.9 percent last year from 53.3 percent in 2006. Latino immigrants, who have the lowest rate of homeownership among the groups studied, did not lose any ground, remaining at the high of 44.7 percent they reached in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The numbers are a reflection that immigrants today have typically been living in the country longer than immigrants of the past, said Rakesh Kochhar, associate director of research for the Pew Hispanic Center, a project of the nonprofit Pew Research Center. The longer immigrants are here, the more secure they tend to become. Among foreign-born Hispanics, ''the force of assimilation into homeownership is strong,'' even during a downturn, Mr. Kochhar said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline in homeownership among other groups, he said, reflects both high foreclosure rates and lower rates of home buying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with the decline, the rate for all groups together remains higher than before the boom, with nearly 68 percent of American households owning homes last year, up from 64 percent in 1994.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gaps between white and minority households remain significant, however, with homeownership rates for Asians (59.1 percent), blacks (47.5 percent) and Latinos (48.9 percent) well below the 74.9 percent among whites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like previous studies, the report found that blacks and Hispanics were more than twice as likely to have subprime mortgages as white homeowners, even among borrowers with comparable incomes. In 2006, the last year of heavy subprime lending, 17.5 percent of white home buyers took subprime loans, compared with 44.9 percent for Hispanics and 52.8 percent for blacks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These loans, which typically require little or no down payment and are meant for borrowers with low credit scores, made homeownership possible for many black and Hispanic families during the boom years, but also led to high rates of foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Basically, that gap was closed on poor loans that never should have been made and wound up harming folks and their neighborhoods,'' said Kevin Stein, associate director of the California Reinvestment Coalition, an organization of nonprofit housing groups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">African-Americans and Latinos remain more likely than whites to be turned down for mortgages, with 26.1 percent of applications from Hispanics rejected in 2007, 30.4 percent of applications from blacks and 12.1 percent of applications from whites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though there were no figures available on the race or ethnicity of homeowners in foreclosure, the researchers found that counties with high concentrations of immigrants had particularly high foreclosure rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the research did not suggest that high rates of immigration on their own caused high levels of foreclosure, Mr. Kochhar said. High unemployment, falling home prices, subprime loans and high ratios of debt to income all contributed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Enrique Lopez, a Miami real estate agent, said that with the tightening of credit, his Hispanic clients had had a harder time getting mortgages than non-Hispanics, in part because they had lower credit scores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lopez, a member of the National Association of Hispanic Real Estate Professionals, said, ''There are people we work with that make enough money, and we can't put them in homes.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE NEWS The number of houses under contract for sale unexpectedly rose in March, as did construction spending, according to new figures from the National Association of Realtors and the Commerce Department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEHIND THE NEWS Troubles in housing -- falling prices, mortgage defaults, foreclosures and weak demand -- have been at the core of the economic slump, so hints that the housing industry has arrested its slide are welcome. Though prices and sales have continued to deteriorate nationally, they are starting to revive in some of the markets that were hit first and hardest by the downturn, like Sacramento, Calif., Las Vegas and parts of Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE NEWS Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said that the economic free fall of the last nine months was nearing an end and that he expected the United States to begin a fragile recovery by the end of this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEHIND THE NEWS Mr. Bernanke tempered his assessment -- his most upbeat in a long time -- by noting that even though the economy seemed to be stabilizing, net job losses would probably continue well into 2010 and the unemployment rate would almost certainly climb further. Even so, Mr. Bernanke told a Congressional committee, ''we are in much better shape than we were in September and October.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE NEWS The broadest of the main stock market indexes, the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500, rallied to close higher on Monday than where it began the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEHIND THE NEWS Though still far below their 2008 peaks, stocks have rallied strongly for two months, erasing the deep lows plumbed in early March, as investors snapped up bargain-price stocks they saw as over-punished by the recession and the financial crisis. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index has done even better, turning positive for the year in early April and continuing to post solid gains. Glimmers of revival in the banking and construction industries continued to buoy stocks later in the week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE NEWS Assessing the soundness of the country's largest banks, federal regulators delivered a more upbeat verdict than expected: All are solvent now, and the amount of fresh capital they collectively need to raise by November is just $75 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEHIND THE NEWS The government's ''stress tests'' for the 19 financial institutions deemed too big to let fail sized up their ability to ride out two years of even deeper recession than has yet been seen; 10 of the 19 were deemed to be adequately capitalized, and most of the capital shortfall was concentrated in just four institutions -- <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>, <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>, GMAC and Citibank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE NEWS The American economy lost fewer jobs in April than economists expected, with payrolls shrinking by 539,000. The unemployment rate rose to 8.9 percent, however, in part because the labor force was swelled by people seeking jobs again after having given up trying to find work in earlier months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEHIND THE NEWS Though the labor market remains extremely weak, the April payroll figures were less disastrous than those of the first three months of the year, when a total of more than two million jobs were lost. Economists saw signs that the pace of job loss would continue to moderate, not least because most of the effects of the federal stimulus plan have yet to be felt.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Re ''How Lehman Got Its Real Estate Fix'' (May 3), about the disastrous investments pioneered by Mark A. Walsh when he was head of the global real estate group at <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span>:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Mr. Walsh had done his homework, he would have walked down Main Street just once pretending to be a homebuyer and spent one day having liars' loans thrust at him. He would have met the real estate agents selling overpriced merchandise to underinformed dreamers and heard the agents' pitch -- ''Investors like you, sir, are making a fortune.'' If he had done his homework, Mr. Walsh might not have played the part he did in devastating our economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This investor did walk Main Streets in California, New Jersey and Florida. This investor saw all the concrete being poured and toured unfinished projects that were 80 percent sold before the first wall went up.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SACRAMENTO -- Is this what a bottom looks like?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This city was among the first in the nation to fall victim to the real estate collapse. Now it seems to be in the earliest stages of a recovery, a hopeful sign for an economy mired in trouble and anxiety.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors and first-time buyers, the traditional harbingers of a housing rebound, are out in force here, competing for bargain-price foreclosures. With sales up 45 percent from last year, the vast backlog of inventory has diminished. Even prices, which have plummeted to levels not seen since the beginning of the decade, show evidence of stabilizing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indications of progress are visible in other hard-hit areas, including Las Vegas, parts of Florida and the Inland Empire in southeastern California. Sales in Las Vegas in March, for example, rose 35 percent from last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's fragile, and it could easily be fleeting,'' said an MDA <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span> analyst, Andrew LePage. ''But history suggests this is how things might look six months before prices bottom out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hope for housing was on full display in the stock market on Monday. News that pending home sales rose in March instead of falling, coupled with improved construction spending, propelled a strong rally. One broad market average, the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index, is now in positive territory for the year, after being down 25 percent on March 9.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one in Sacramento is predicting that local housing prices, which have been cut in half from their mid-2005 peak, are going to reclaim much of that ground anytime soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, this is what passes for wild-eyed optimism: a belief that things have finally stopped getting worse. ''A period of price stagnation would boost a lot of spirits,'' Mr. LePage said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When a market bottoms, foreclosures usually stop piling up and banks become more willing to make loans, confident the collateral backing them will not fall in value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, signs of progress in real estate are still faint at best. Existing home sales in March were down 7 percent from last year, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of unsold homes was about 10 months, a number that has changed little over the last year and is abnormally high. But first-time buyers were an impressive 53 percent of the market -- and that was largely before a first-time buyer's tax credit of $8,000 became available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the tax credit in place and interest rates low, the pace of sales may be picking up. The Realtors' group said Monday that the number of houses under contract in March was up 1 percent from a year earlier. Those pending deals will be reported in the existing-home sales for April and May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales volume tends to recover long before prices. In fact, some analysts think price declines in many markets are accelerating. First American CoreLogic, a real estate data firm, reported that ''the depth and breadth of price declines continued to worsen in February.'' Fitch Ratings recently revised its estimate of future declines to 12.5 percent, from 10 percent, saying the drop would extend to the end of next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amid the uncertainty, Sacramento is drawing scrutiny as a test case. The area boomed in the first part of the decade; the population of Sacramento County increased 10 percent, to 1.4 million, as San Franciscans sought cheaper places to live.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the market peaked and the ability to refinance all those costly mortgages dried up, the carnage began. There have been 28,898 foreclosures in Sacramento County since 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales in the top half of the market remain slow. The Federal Reserve reported on Monday that half of all banks recently tightened their lending standards on prime mortgages. Many would-be buyers, here as elsewhere, simply cannot get financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sellers, meanwhile, are reluctant to lower their prices, preferring to bide their time. New construction is nearly nonexistent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What drives the market here, then, are all those foreclosures. Two-thirds of the 2,092 existing single-family houses and condominiums sold here in March were bank repossessions, up from 8.5 percent two years ago, according to MDA <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span>, a real estate research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These cut-rate properties are engendering the same frenzy and frustration that symbolized the boom, as Rebecca and Chris Whitman discovered when they started looking for a house in December. Ms. Whitman's new job as an athletics director at Sacramento State required an immediate move from Chico, two hours north.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In two months the couple looked at 100 houses, nearly all foreclosures priced under $200,000, making verbal offers on 20. Only rarely did they get a response. Banks trying to unload large numbers of properties are less interested in traditional transactions with individuals than all-cash offers from investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As interest rates fell, the Whitmans were able to increase their price limit. They ended up buying from investors. A syndicate had bought a three-bedroom foreclosure on a cul-de-sac in eastern Sacramento last fall for $172,000, made a few improvements and was flipping it -- another boom-era element that is back. The Whitmans bought it three weeks ago for $224,500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We think we got a good deal,'' said Ms. Whitman, 31. Their monthly payment, including property taxes, will be about $1,200. Renting an equivalent house, with space for their two dogs, two cats and the baby they are expecting, would have been hundreds of dollars more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When buying is cheaper than renting, markets begin to turn. At the current rate of sales, there is less than three months of inventory in the Sacramento market. In normal times, that would indicate a seller's market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Except these are not normal times. The unemployment rate in the county is 11.3 percent, the highest in decades. That will prompt more foreclosures all by itself. Furthermore, banks have lifted various processing moratoriums that lowered foreclosures last fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These two factors yielded a rise in the number of default notices filed in Sacramento County in March to 2,819, a record. Thousands more bank-owned houses are likely to come to market this summer and fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That will stall any progress toward stability,'' said Michael Lyon, chief executive of Lyon Real Estate. ''The prospects for a recovery are fool's gold.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lyon expects further price declines and slowing sales. But David Berson, the chief economist for the mortgage insurer PMI, argues that such bleakness from the people whose livelihood is selling houses is itself a positive sign. ''Things are awful at the bottom, and we're at the bottom,'' Mr. Berson said. ''No question about it. But the trend going forward should be higher sales, and that will eventually affect prices.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Pending sales of previously owned homes rose for a second month in March, while construction spending edged higher, according to reports on Monday that suggested moderation in the long housing slump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reports lent support to the view that the recession, now in its 17th month, was close to finding a bottom. A Federal Reserve survey of loan officers showed demand for prime mortgages rose in the first quarter for the first time since early 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''On balance, it's an encouraging set of news. Pending home sales tell us, as far as the housing sector is concerned, we are getting near the bottom,'' said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Mass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed in March, rose 3.2 percent as first-time buyers waded into the market to take advantage of favorable prices and mortgage rates, and an $8,000 federal tax credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report from the Commerce Department showed construction spending rose 0.3 percent in March, the first increase in six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pending home sales report added to evidence that sales had reached a bottom, said Michael Darda, chief economist at MKM Partners in Greenwich, Conn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's critical because once sales bottom, it's only a matter of time before you work off excess inventories. That's the key to stabilization in the financial system and the economy at large. We're closer to that than people thought just a few months ago,'' said Mr. Darda.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BACK when he was a major Wall Street deal maker, Mark A. Walsh, the former head of the global real estate group at <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span>, had a running joke with Carmine Visone, one of his managing directors. Mr. Visone, 10 years older than his boss, would lecture Mr. Walsh about the importance of fundamentals: land values, construction cost and rents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Mr. Visone remembers it, Mr. Walsh would wave his hand dismissively and would argue just as emphatically that the best way to make office buildings spew cash was through the magic of financial engineering. Typically, Mr. Visone gave in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He was too smart for me,'' Mr. Visone recalls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many others were equally in awe of Mr. Walsh's intellect. Until <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> collapsed last September, Mr. Walsh was considered the most brilliant real estate financier on Wall Street. In the '90s, he pioneered the art of lending to office building developers and then slicing up and repackaging the debt for investors. Less risky pieces went to institutional investors; the lower-rated chunks to hedge funds and others hungry for juicier returns. Lehman pocketed a fee every step of the way, and it often retained a risky piece or two to give its own earnings a kick.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That was one of Lehman's strengths,'' says Brad Hintz, a former chief financial officer at Lehman who is now an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. ''In fact, a lot of Wall Street firms tried to duplicate Lehman's commercial real estate strategy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Walsh, who wore rumpled Brooks Brothers suits and could be painfully awkward in front of crowds, was one of Lehman's biggest profit producers. Former Lehman executives say Richard S. Fuld Jr., the bank's chief, relied on Mr. Walsh to bankroll the firm's swanlike transformation from a second-tier bond trading shop into a full-service investment bank. Former members of his unit, who requested anonymity because they were concerned about being swept up in lawsuits and investigations surrounding Lehman's collapse, say it generated more than 20 percent of Lehman's $4 billion in profits at the peak of the real estate boom in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many factors, of course, contributed to Lehman's demise last fall. Near the end, it carried $25 billion in toxic residential mortgages. It was wildly overleveraged. And the federal government made the fateful decision not to rescue Lehman from its mistakes. But when real estate overheated in the years before Lehman's implosion, Mr. Walsh made billions of dollars in loans and equity investments that also ultimately helped bring down the bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lehman's bankruptcy hasn't quelled the controversy about Mr. Walsh's activities. Last fall, the United States attorney's office in Manhattan subpoenaed him and other former Lehman executives as part of an investigation into whether the firm improperly valued its commercial real estate holdings, among other things. In March in a civil complaint, Anne Milgram, the New Jersey attorney general, accused Mr. Walsh and 17 other former Lehman officials of defrauding the state's pension funds by misrepresenting Lehman's real estate exposure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Walsh, 49, declined to be interviewed for this article.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His former co-workers and clients remain staunchly loyal. ''I have the greatest respect for him personally and professionally,'' says Richard S. Ziman, the former C.E.O. of Arden Realty, a company based in Los Angeles that Mr. Walsh helped take public in 1996 and sell in 2006. ''I'd testify in court if that was necessary.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even among Mr. Walsh's supporters, a nagging question remains: How could a real estate wizard who built a thriving business by creating new ways of managing risk by sweeping loans off Lehman's balance sheet end up doing deals that contradicted everything he seemed to stand for -- and contribute to the collapse of one of Wall Street's most venerable firms?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. WALSH grew up in Yonkers, the son of a lawyer who once served as chairman of the New York City Housing Authority. He attended Iona Preparatory School in New Rochelle; the College of the Holy Cross, where he majored in economics; and, finally, the Fordham University School of Law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After receiving his law degree in 1984, he worked as a real estate lawyer in Miami and handled a lot of foreclosures. That came in handy when he took a job at Lehman in 1988, at the end of an earlier real estate boom that left banks and insurers saddled with mountains of bad loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Walsh bought and sold loans on properties that were often in foreclosure. There were bargains galore. He generated hundreds of millions of profits for the firm and won the confidence of Mr. Fuld, who gave him the authority to make huge loans. Then, along with Ethan Penner of Nomura Securities and Andrew D. Stone of Credit Suisse First Boston, Mr. Walsh discovered securitization. This created an entirely new market for commercial real estate debt. No longer would lenders have to shoulder all the risk from real estate lending. Wall Street could make the same loans and sell them off. The challenge then became lassoing the right kind of developers to back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three men marketed their services very differently. Mr. Penner hired Bob Dylan, Stevie Nicks and the Eagles to serenade clients, while Mr. Stone jetted around the country with the likes of Donald Trump. The publicity-shy Mr. Walsh was more understated. Mr. Ziman says Mr. Walsh went fly-fishing with clients in Colorado and Montana.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers also loved the fact that Mr. Walsh was willing to lend them enormous sums. In 1997, Barry Sternlicht, then the chief executive of <span class="companylink">Starwood Hotels and Resorts</span>, needed $7 billion to buy ITT.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I called up Mark and <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> and said, 'Would you be interested?' '' he recalls. ''Goldman said they were. They came to see us. But we needed to get it done really quickly. Mark said, 'Yeah, we'll do it.' I said, 'Really? You are going to do it yourselves?' He said, 'Yup.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sternlicht says Mr. Walsh brought Mr. Fuld himself to a meeting at the hotelier's home to assure him that Lehman would back his acquisition. ''Dick Fuld sat there in my living room and said: 'You have our word. We'll get this done,' '' Mr. Sternlicht recalls. ''We paid a $20 million fee. I was never so happy paying a fee.'' Mr. Fuld declined to be interviewed for this article.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the late '90s, Mr. Walsh forged close ties with many of the most prominent developers in New York. He bankrolled Tishman Speyer in its purchase of the Chrysler Building in 1997. He backed Steven C. Witkoff in his purchase of the Woolworth Building in 1998. And he financed the acquisitions by the German real estate developers Aby Rosen and Michael Fuchs of the landmark Lever House and Seagram Building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rosen recalls that he and Mr. Walsh closed the $375 million Seagram Building deal in four weeks. ''He was fast,'' says Mr. Rosen. ''He doesn't try to kill you or retrade. To be honest, there are very few people in the industry you can say that about.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Walsh was also skilled at making all that debt vanish from Lehman's balance sheet before the firm choked on it. On the eve of the financial crisis brought by the near collapse of <span class="companylink">Long Term Capital Management</span> in 1998, Lehman flushed $3.6 billion in commercial real estate loans through its securitization machine, avoiding some of the losses that crippled other firms, including Nomura and <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Walsh was rewarded with more responsibility, and in 2000 was named co-head of a new private equity group dedicated to real estate investments. After raising $1.6 billion from pension funds and university endowments and delivering an internal rate of return of more than 30 percent, the equity franchise easily raised $2.4 billion for a second fund, which closed in 2005. While the market was heating up and low-priced deals were harder to find, the second fund still generated a 15 percent return.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the funds' structure created perverse incentives within Mr. Walsh's group, according to two former members of his team who requested anonymity because of confidentiality agreements they had signed with Lehman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lehman owned 20 percent of the funds. Institutions and wealthy investors controlled the rest. Mr. Walsh, in order to raise money, promised to give the outsiders a first peek at deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If institutional investors and others passed, Mr. Walsh's bankers were free to make the same investments with the firm's money -- which was just fine with his troops: they received bigger bonuses on the riskier deals because Lehman didn't have to share the profits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it also meant that more deals that could go wrong ended up on Lehman's balance sheet. And this is exactly what happened with a set of deals known as ''bridge equity'' financings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As real estate went into overdrive in 2003, Mr. Walsh, in order to help clients pump up their offers in heated bidding wars, started frequently putting Lehman's own cash into deals -- alongside the debt they raised. With its cash on the line, Lehman would be dangerously exposed in any downturn, so, once a deal closed, the firm would try to sell its equity stake as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lehman made ripe 4 percent fees for its equity investments -- twice the going rate for loan securitization. As long as the market was rising, Mr. Walsh's group was fine. But if the bank couldn't sell the bridge equity and if real estate prices fell, it could end up with nothing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was a classic assumption that values are going to be higher a year from now,'' says Mike Kirby, chairman of Green Street Advisors, a research firm. ''That was the mentality at the time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bridge equity quickly became one of Lehman's signature products, and Mr. Walsh's group deployed it in dozens of deals, including Tishman Speyer's $1.7 billion purchase of the MetLife Building on Park Avenue in 2005 and Beacon Capital Partners' acquisition of the <span class="companylink">News Corporation</span>'s headquarters on the Avenue of the Americas for more than $1.5 billion in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Guys like Tishman Speyer wanted as much of this product as they could get,'' says a former real estate banker at a competing Wall Street firm, who requested anonymity because of confidentially agreements he had signed with the bank. ''For them, it was a no-brainer. It was like, 'Bring as much of this on as possible.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By all accounts, Mr. Walsh made piles of money. He had perks like a corner office over Park Avenue with a private conference room. Yet his ego never matched the size of his deals. Friends say Mr. Walsh lived in a modest home in Rye, N.Y., with his wife, Lisa, and their three boys. His main interest outside of work and family was fishing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''At the end of the day, he is content to throw a line in the water and fish by himself,'' says his friend Dan McNulty, co-chairman of DTZ Rockwood, a real estate investment bank in New York. ''He's a very reflective guy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IF Lehman and Mr. Walsh were convinced about the virtues of bridge equity, outside investors weren't. ''It was a gray area,'' says a former Lehman executive who asked not to be identified because of his confidentiality agreements with the firm. ''It wasn't the kind of risk that the investors had signed up for. The funds never participated in those deals.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One partnership pursued by Mr. Walsh exemplified his newfound appetite for ever riskier deals: transactions with the SunCal Companies of Irvine, Calif., an operation with an intriguing business model. It bought land, primarily in its home state, and sought government approval for residential development. If it got the green light, it sold the land to builders for an enormous profit. Mr. Walsh lent SunCal more than $2 billion and formed a close relationship with its founder, Boris Elieff. Mr. Elieff did not return calls seeking comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We had other <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> and other people who were clamoring to do business with us,'' says Louis Miller, a lawyer for SunCal. ''Lehman said, 'No, we want to you to be exclusive with us.' They loved SunCal.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But because the cash flow from the SunCal deals was hard to predict, Lehman's loans to the company were nearly impossible to syndicate. After all, how do you estimate income from raw land that may or may not be approved for development?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After putting about $140 million from the funds into SunCal deals, Mr. Walsh discovered that the investors wanted out. In 2006, he cashed them out with a tidy profit in exchange for effectively transferring their ownership stake onto Lehman's balance sheet. That left Lehman with even more SunCal exposure, just before the emergence of the subprime crisis that would pummel the Southern California real estate market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others were already sensing danger, and some of Mr. Walsh's longtime clients started to pull back. Mr. Ziman of Arden Realty sold his company to <span class="companylink">GE Capital</span> in 2006. He said the real estate market -- and, indeed, the entire financial system behind it -- was becoming increasingly bizarre.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Every Monday, I'd get these e-mails from all the investment banks about the deals of the week,'' Mr. Ziman recalls. ''I kept saying, 'Where is all this money coming from?' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lehman wasn't the only bank throwing bridge equity into real estate. In October 2006, <span class="companylink">Wachovia</span> and <span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span> pledged $1.5 billion for Tishman Speyer's $5.4 billion acquisition of Stuyvesant Town, the huge apartment complex in Manhattan. In February, <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>, <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> and <span class="companylink">Bear Stearns</span> put up $3.5 billion into the <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group</span>'s $32 billion deal to buy <span class="companylink">Equity Office Properties Trust</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Missing out on the Stuyvesant Town deal stung Lehman, said one of the firm's bankers who declined to be identified because he wasn't authorized to speak publicly about his time at Lehman. It wasn't just the lost fees. Mr. Walsh considered Tishman Speyer a core client. What's more, Tishman Speyer's chairman, Jerry Speyer, had a close relationship with Mr. Fuld. They were both board members of the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of New York</span>; Mr. Speyer and Mr. Fuld's wife, Kathleen, were trustees of the Museum of Modern Art.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it wasn't long before Mr. Walsh found a way to do an even bigger deal with Mr. Speyer's company. In May 2007, Lehman and Tishman Speyer offered to buy <span class="companylink">Archstone-Smith Trust</span>, a $22 billion deal struck at the peak of an already dangerously frothy market. Tishman Speyer put up a mere $250 million of its own equity. Lehman, in a 50-50 partnership with <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>, put up $17.1 billion of debt and $4.6 billion in bridge equity financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the credit crisis began to set in during the following summer, the financing for the Archstone deal appeared imperiled. With the markets spiraling downward, rumors were rife that Lehman was having problems and that it might walk away from the Archstone transaction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Speyer phoned Mr. Fuld to make sure that he still had Lehman's backing. ''When I placed that call, I knew it was preposterous,'' Mr. Speyer recalled in an interview with The New York Times in 2007. ''I placed it because I had to. But I knew when I was dialing how the conversation would come out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lehman stuck by Mr. Speyer, and the deal was completed in October 2007. Had Lehman walked away, the partners would have absorbed a $1.5 billion breakup fee. In hindsight, it would have been smart to swallow that loss. But several people involved in the deal say the parties thought that the subprime mortgage crisis would actually help Archstone because people who could no longer afford houses would rent the company's apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And for his part, Mr. Walsh was reluctant to jeopardize an important client relationship.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A former Lehman executive, who declined to be identified because he wasn't authorized to speak publicly about his time at the firm, said: ''We were very loyal to our clients and had a culture of standing by our clients, even when the road got bumpy. We did not back away from commitments. We could not have built such a dominant franchise with any other approach. That culture, of course, has its risks and downside, including losing money on some transactions.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Walsh tried to limit Lehman's risk. He sold $8.9 billion of the Archstone debt to <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> and persuaded <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> and <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> to buy $2.4 billion of the bridge equity. Even so, Lehman ended up with nearly 25 percent of a hugely overpriced deal just as real estate was imploding. This time, Lehman couldn't sell its immense hunk of bridge equity, and it was stuck with a $2.2 billion ownership stake that nobody wanted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, there were no hard feelings between the partners. ''Mark is an extremely talented investor and a great partner,'' Mr. Speyer says. ''We look forward to working with him in the future.'' Of course, the most that Tishman Speyer could lose on Archstone was $250 million -- a pittance next to Lehman's total $5.4 billion exposure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lehman soon had much bigger worries. In March 2008, <span class="companylink">Bear Stearns</span> nearly collapsed and was sold to <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span> in a government-supported deal. Wall Street wondered which bank might be next to fall. Short-sellers thought they knew: <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Walsh and his crew rushed to sell their inventory. Between November 2007 and February 2008, Lehman shed $2.8 billion of its commercial real estate exposure. But that still left $36 billion of hard-to-value leftovers, including debt and equity from Archstone and SunCal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last spring, the hedge fund investor David Einhorn, who was shorting Lehman's stock, suggested that the bank's positions in Archstone and SunCal might be worthless. Mr. Einhorn said share prices of Archstone's competitors had tumbled as much as 30 percent since the acquisition was announced. As for SunCal, he pointed out that publicly traded home builders had written down their Southern California land holdings to ''pennies on the dollar.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Einhorn called for Lehman to take a multibillion-dollar write-down on its Archstone holdings. Lehman said it was valuing its commercial real estate fairly, based on the prices that Mr. Walsh's group had been getting on the open market as it struggled to free up the bank's balance sheet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lehman ended up with $29 billion in commercial mortgage exposure on its books in the second quarter of 2008 -- 30 percent more than <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> and <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> and 70 percent more than <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In early September, Lehman announced that it would stuff its toxic commercial mortgages into a new public company to be spun off to shareholders. The idea went nowhere. ''They couldn't get that commercial real estate off their books to save their lives,'' says Mr. Hintz at Sanford C. Bernstein.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In short order, Lehman collapsed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOON after Lehman's bankruptcy, a former executive who declined to be identified because he wasn't authorized to speak publicly about his time at the firm went to Mr. Walsh's office to talk. But they sat in silence. After two minutes, the executive left. ''It became clear that neither one of us was going to say something that the other didn't already know, or that we were going to actually have a new idea or bring greater clarity to the situation,'' he recalls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultimately, <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> scooped up part of Lehman's operations. But it dismissed Mr. Walsh and most of his team. Now the United States attorney's office and the New Jersey attorney general are trying to determine whether Mr. Walsh did anything wrong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But according to former Lehman executives who requested anonymity because of confidentially agreements, the values of commercial real estate holdings were determined by an independent committee outside his division.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Walsh has hired Patrick J. Smith, a former federal prosecutor who is now a partner at <span class="companylink">DLA Piper</span>, to defend him in these investigations. Mr. Smith declined to comment for this article.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, Mr. Walsh is staying busy. He is helping the estate of his former employer dispose of its private equity holdings. His friends say they believe that Mr. Walsh will eventually emerge from the rubble of Lehman's collapse and return to deal-making.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Guys like this are very rare,'' says Mr. Rosen, the developer. ''He'll be back. He picked up the phone and people listen. Nobody can take that away from him.''</p>

</div><div class="author">By DAVID STREITFELD and JACK HEALY   </div><div>1120 words</div><div>29 April 2009</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phoenix has achieved the unwelcome distinction of becoming the first major American city where home prices have fallen in half since the market peaked in the middle of the decade, according to data released Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though historical statistics are scant, experts said the precipitous decline probably had few if any equals in modern times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Even during the Depression, I'm not sure prices fell this quickly,'' said Karl Guntermann, a professor of real estate at Arizona State University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greg Swann, a Phoenix real estate agent, took a moment to marvel at the news. ''What happened here will some day be a new chapter in 'Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds,' '' the classic survey of investing mania, he said. ''We were living during the boom like there was no tomorrow. And guess what? Now it's tomorrow.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in the Sun Belt city, the 12th-largest metropolitan area in the United States, dropped 4.5 percent in February, according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case-Shiller Home Price Index. Prices in Phoenix are now down 50.8 percent since the market peaked in June 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the country as a whole, the Case-Shiller numbers offered the thinnest of silver linings: things are still getting worse, but more slowly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In February, the price of single-family homes in 20 major metropolitan areas fell 18.6 percent from the year earlier, compared with a record drop of 19 percent in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Finally, we're seeing a touch of moderation,'' said David Blitzer, chairman of S.&amp; P.'s index committee. ''This is the kind of thing one might see if we're beginning to see a bottom. I would not run out and celebrate, but I would not dig the bunker any deeper.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Blitzer said the decline in Phoenix outpaced any during the recession of the early 1990s, for which reliable figures are available. The only precedents he could cite were the Midwestern cities hit by the Great Depression and a contemporaneous drought, and Miami after a 1920s craze for beachfront property reversed itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The boom in Phoenix was founded on a basic truth: it was a place where many people wanted to live. But the market turned irrational. Investors bought homes they did not even bother to rent out. They merely waited a few months until prices rose again so they could flip them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ordinary homeowners got caught up, too. ''People saw themselves as cashing in on a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,'' Mr. Guntermann said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Except for the few who managed to get out at the peak, it was a mistake. By now, anyone who bought in Phoenix a decade ago would have lost money after inflation. Many did not get off so easily. Foreclosure notices were filed against one in 40 houses in the metropolitan area in the first quarter, according to RealtyTrac Inc. That was the ninth-highest rate in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller data show that housing markets across the United States are still suffering. Half of the 20 metropolitan areas in the index posted record year-over-year declines. In all, the 20-city index was down 2.2 percent from January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From Atlanta to San Francisco to Chicago, not one of the 20 cities posted a gain in home prices from January to February, and values in all but five cities dropped by double digits from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nearly 51 percent drop in Phoenix is not an isolated plunge. Prices in Las Vegas are down some 48 percent from their peaks. They are down 45 percent in Miami from their highest levels, and down 40 percent in Los Angeles and San Diego.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said housing prices would probably continue to fall as Americans, worried about rising unemployment and the recession, put off big financial decisions like buying a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists expect housing prices to fall another 5 to 10 percent before they hit a bottom; others say that prices could decline by as much as a third. According to the National Association of Realtors, the median price of a home in the United States, which peaked above $230,000 in 2006, has fallen to $175,200.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As prices have dropped, frozen housing markets in hard-hit areas like Southern California, Phoenix, Las Vegas and South Florida have begun to thaw. Record-low mortgage rates and huge inventories of foreclosed homes and other fire-sale properties have enticed first-time buyers to the market and lured others who had been sitting on the sidelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales in Southern California and the San Francisco Bay area, where foreclosures dominate many markets, have snapped back this spring as prices dropped. But sales have slowed to a crawl in other markets like New York City, where prices declined 10 percent from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're seeing very strong sales in a few states and weak sales across 40 states,'' said Patrick Newport, United States economist at IHS Global Insight. ''The key factor driving them right now is just the excess inventory. Even though prices are undervalued, they're still going to drop because of the excess. Even if we were at full employment we'd still see prices dropping.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories of unsold homes are edging down slightly, but there was still a glut of 3.7 million unsold homes in March, the Realtors' group reported, representing a supply of nearly 10 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Swan, the realty agent, said inventories of lower-priced homes were already dwindling in Phoenix as investors snapped up bank-owned properties at bargain prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've got Canadians coming here who are putting together investment pools of millions of dollars to buy houses by the hundreds,'' he said. ''They're going to rent them out to all the people who were foreclosed and need a place to live. This is going to be a good year for us.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The closest thing to a real estate crystal ball in the last few years has been the house auctions that are regularly held around the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2006 and early 2007, the official housing statistics were still showing that house prices were holding up. But that was largely because so many sellers were refusing to sell. The auctions, made up mostly of foreclosed homes, showed the truth: house values were starting to plummet in many places.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So a few weeks ago, I decided to go to an auction at a hotel ballroom in Washington -- and to study the results of several others elsewhere -- with an eye to figuring out whether prices may now be close to bottoming out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's clearly a huge economic question. Last week, <span class="companylink">JPMorgan</span>'s chief financial officer told Eric Dash of The New York Times that <span class="companylink">JPMorgan</span>, and presumably other banks, would be under pressure ''until home prices stabilize and unemployment peaks.'' As long as home prices are falling, foreclosures are likely to keep rising and the toxic assets polluting bank balance sheets are likely to stay toxic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are reasons, though, to think that prices may be on the verge of stabilizing. Relative to fundamentals, like household incomes and rents, houses nationwide now appear to be overvalued by only about 5 percent. You can make an argument that the end of the housing crash is near.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that's not what I found at the auctions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a perfect storm of opportunity,'' Bob Michaelis, goateed with a shaved head, told the 300 or so people who had come to downtown Washington for the auction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Michaelis, the auction manager, spoke from a lectern on stage, and his goal seemed to be to persuade people that they might never see a buyers' market as good as this one. Prices have plunged, and interest rates, he said, are at ''generational lows.'' (The National Association of Realtors has been running a radio commercial this spring making a similar case.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Look around to your left and your right, and you'll see someone who sees an opportunity just like you do,'' Mr. Michaelis said. ''We're approaching the bottom of the market, I think. We're approaching the bottom of the market, if we're not there already.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He then told the audience that, in the last 100 years, house prices have recovered from every downturn and gone on to reach record highs. Oh, and <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> and Countrywide were standing by, ready to offer financing to qualified auction buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If nothing else, this sales pitch certainly had chutzpah. It combined the old bubble-era notion that house prices always rise over time (ignoring the fact that incomes, stock values and the price of bread do, too) with the new postcrash idea that houses must be a bargain because they're a lot cheaper than they used to be. Even Countrywide, which was taken over by <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> after so many of its subprime mortgages went bad, is still part of the housing pitch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet as soon as the auction began, it was clear that the pitch wasn't working.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The winning bid on the first home auctioned off, a two-bedroom townhouse in Virginia Beach, was $115,000. Just last July, it sold for $182,000, according to property records. A four-bedroom brick house with a two-car garage in Upper Marlboro, Md., went for $375,000. Last year, it sold for $563,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Throughout the evening, such low-ball prices continued to win the bidding. At one point, the auctioneer, Wayne Wheat, interrupted his sing-song auction call to cheerfully ask, ''Where are my investors?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tables that had been set up around the edges of the ballroom, reserved for people planning to buy multiple houses, were mostly empty. Many audience members, like the man in a camouflage baseball cap just in front of me, were attending their first auction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Sunday, my colleague Carmen Gentile went to a larger auction, in Miami, to see if my experience had been unusual. It wasn't. The homes there also sold for just a fraction of what they would have even a year ago. The rate of decline in Miami hasn't even slowed noticeably in recent months, according to data kept by Real Estate Disposition Corporation, known as R.E.D.C., which runs the auctions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recently transplanted New Yorker named Michael Houtkin won the bidding on a one-bedroom condominium on the outskirts of Boca Raton, a few blocks from three golf courses, for the incredible price of $30,000. ''Things were almost being given away,'' he said later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As is often the case at these auctions, the seller of the condo -- <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> -- retained the right to refuse the winning bid and keep the property. But Mr. Houtkin told me he was optimistic his bid would be accepted. An R.E.D.C. employee suggested to him that $30,000 wasn't much below the minimum price that <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> had hoped to receive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How could that be? Because <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, like many banks, is inundated with foreclosed properties. In recent weeks, banks have begun accelerating foreclosures again, after having held off while waiting to find out which homeowners would be eligible for the Obama administration's assistance program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The glut of foreclosed homes creates a self-reinforcing cycle. Falling prices lead to more foreclosures. Foreclosures lead to an excess supply of homes for sale. The excess supply then leads to further price declines. Jan Hatzius, the chief economist at <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>, says that the ''massive amount of excess supply'' means that home prices nationwide will probably fall an additional 15 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This estimate hides a lot of variation, too. In Miami, Goldman forecasts, prices could drop an additional 33 percent, which is pretty amazing since they've already fallen 50 percent from their 2006 peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor is excess supply the only reason prices still have a way to fall. Nationwide, homes may not be overvalued by much. But in some cities, including New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston, Chicago and Miami, they remain very expensive. So while Mr. Hatzius and his Goldman colleagues are somewhat more pessimistic than most forecasters, the difference isn't enormous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'll confess that this bearish picture isn't exactly what I had hoped to find. A year ago, as part of a move from New York to Washington, my wife and I bought our first house. We did so fully expecting prices to continue falling (though perhaps not as much as they ultimately will, given the severity of the financial crisis). But we decided they had fallen enough for us to take the plunge. We preferred buying before the bottom of the market instead of renting and having to move again in a year or two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, when I wrote about that decision last spring, I argued that anyone who didn't have to move probably should not buy yet. Prices still had a way to fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They don't have as far to fall today, but the great real estate crash is not over, either. So if you are part of the 30 percent of American households who rent and you're trying to decide when to buy, relax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market is still coming your way.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though it came as no surprise to investors, the collapse of <span class="companylink">General Growth Properties</span>, the nation's second-largest mall owner, has stirred new fears about a coming debacle in commercial real estate. The company, which owns 200 shopping centers encompassing 200 million square feet and 24,000 tenants, filed for bankruptcy protection last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the credit markets virtually shut down, General Growth said it was unable to refinance the $3.3 billion in debt that had already matured or would be due this year. These included loans totaling $900 million on two malls in Las Vegas -- Fashion Show and the Shoppes at the Palazzo -- that were due to be repaid in November. An additional $6.4 billion in debt matures next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The global credit crisis, weakening retail demand and rising unemployment have taken a toll on commercial property around the world. At least $153 billion worth of property is already in distress, according to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>, a New York research company. Of this, $87.1 billion represents defaulted mortgages, while the rest is outstanding debt from about 40 commercial-property and investment companies that have failed, most of them outside the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Japan, Australia and Spain, more companies than properties have faltered, said Robert M. White Jr., the president of Real Capital. ''Here in the U.S., the majority of the issues are more at the property level than the company level right now,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">General Growth has a good reputation as an operator of shopping malls, but it has been widely criticized for relying heavily on short-term mortgage debt, a practice that most public real estate companies frown on. Analysts said General Growth's failure does not mean that other large real estate investment trusts, or REITs, are likely to follow it into bankruptcy court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the contrary, the REIT industry is trying to reinvigorate itself. In recent months, 10 of the strongest REITs have issued $4.7 billion in equity, giving them capital for near-term debt maturities, said Keven S. Lindemann, the director of real estate for SNL Financial, a research company in Charlottesville, Va.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These companies include the <span class="companylink">Simon Property Group</span>, the nation's largest mall owner; the <span class="companylink">Kimco Realty Corporation</span>, an operator of strip malls; and the <span class="companylink">AMB Property Corporation</span> and Pro- Logis, which specialize in distribution centers. On Tuesday, <span class="companylink">Vornado Realty Trust</span>, which owns office buildings and shopping centers, joined the list.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other REITs are expected to follow suit, said Barry Vinocur, the editor of the trade publisher REIT Zone Publications. The infusion of new capital ''removes the risk and the uncertainty,'' Mr. Vinocur said, ''and at some point in time, there are going to be opportunities, and these companies will be better positioned to take advantage of them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike Kirby, a principal at Green Street Advisors, a research company in Newport Beach, Calif., said he expected as many as 20 of the weaker REITs to ''either vanish, get acquired or become inactive.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like General Growth, many highly leveraged private companies are finding it difficult, if not impossible, to refinance mortgages that were issued to them as real estate values were soaring. In the United States, about $537 billion in mortgages will mature before the end of next year, said Sam Chandan, the president of Real Estate Economics, a New York company that monitors the real estate debt markets. ''There is growing evidence that even good-quality borrowers do not have access to refinancing,'' Mr. Chandan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, General Growth financed much of its rapid expansion with bonds made up of pooled commercial mortgages, which are then sliced into various categories of risk. Delinquencies of so-called commercial mortgage-backed securities represent only 1.4 percent of all outstanding loans, but they are increasing at an alarming rate. In February, the delinquent unpaid balance for these loans amounted to $11.99 billion, up from $3.48 billion in February 2008, according to Realpoint, a credit ratings agency in Horsham, Pa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two-thirds of the delinquency, in dollar volume, comes from loans issued in 2005 to 2007, a period when competition among lenders led to overly optimistic projections about rent growth. Delinquencies are expected to rise as borrowers exhaust reserve funds they established to cover their debt service while they waited for rents to go up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">General Growth's problems have highlighted the difficulties for borrowers in modifying loans that have been securitized. In a filing with the bankruptcy court, Adam S. Metz, the chief executive of General Growth since John Bucksbaum, a member of the company's founding family, stepped down in October, said the company faced ''steep logistical challenges'' in trying to negotiate extensions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Restrictions stemming from tax considerations make it extremely difficult to change the terms of a securitized loan, said Thomas A. Humphreys, a partner in New York at the law firm <span class="companylink">Morrison &amp; Foerster</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another obstacle for borrowers is that investors in commercial mortgage-backed securities have divergent interests, depending on their level of risk. Investors with the highest-grade bonds may want to cash out through a sale of the mortgaged property, while investors in junk bonds who face an immediate loss may want to hold a property in case values rise. Mr. Kirby said property values had declined as much as 40 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The securitization system ''didn't contemplate that there would be such a rapid change in valuation, and that this would happen during a time when there wouldn't be a functioning financial market,'' said D. Michael Van Konynenburg, the president of Eastdil Secured, a national brokerage firm, and the head of its loan sale team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With so few properties changing hands, values are hard to determine. One benchmark is the recent sale, reportedly for $355 million, of the office portion of the 40-story Bertelsmann Building at 1540 Broadway, between 45th and 46th Streets in Midtown Manhattan, that had commanded $525 million when it was sold to <span class="companylink">Equity Office Properties</span> in 2006. The next year, the developer Harry Macklowebought it as part of a portfolio that he acquired for $7 billion. Last year, Mr. Macklowe surrendered the portfolio to his lender after he was unable to make his debt payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another transaction that received widespread attention, the 60-story John Hancock Tower in Boston was auctioned off this month in a foreclosure sale for $660.6 million, half of what the previous owner paid for it in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline may seem steep, but Mr. Kirby said values are reverting to where they were before the commercial real estate bubble began in middecade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kirby said he could not say how much the value of shopping malls has slipped because there have been no sizable transactions in more than a year. General Growth has said that even as its problems worsened, its malls were more than 90 percent occupied, and its net operating income last year of $2.59 billion was an increase of 4.5 percent over 2007. The company has said it plans to keep its portfolio intact during the bankruptcy proceeding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Jim Sullivan, an analyst at Green Street Advisors, said occupancy and rents were going to suffer, even in the strongest malls. ''This retail downturn is different from the ones we've seen in the past,'' he said. ''Even the successful retailers are suffering sales erosion. It impedes their ability to pay higher rent, and it makes them cautious about opening new stores and new concepts.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CLOSE your eyes, click your heels, and repeat, ''It is a good time to be in real estate.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is a message that Franck Ruimy, a London-based investment manager, has been sharing as he travels to New York and other cities, looking for trophy apartments for his European investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While wealthy Americans, fretting over vanishing bonuses, waning confidence and shrunken portfolios, are shying away from the trophies of yore, Mr. Ruimy has been investing in some of the most talked-about new Manhattan condominiums. His plan: buy them at a discount and rent them out for tens of thousands of dollars a month while looking for long-term price appreciation over the next 10 to 15 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of March, Mr. Ruimy, operating through a series of limited liability corporations, closed on five apartments, including four contiguous units on the 17th and 18th floors at the Laurel, a 31-story limestone and glass tower at 400 East 67th Street, at First Avenue, for a total of $11.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that was only a small part of the portfolio Mr. Ruimy has been assembling in Manhattan. Two years ago, he bought three apartments at 165 Charles Street, a glass tower in the West Village facing the Hudson River designed by Richard Meier. He paid a total of $17.7 million; one unit was recently listed for rent at $27,000 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last July, he bought a $6.85 million apartment at 40 Mercer Street in SoHo, a new 13-story condominium designed by Jean Nouvel, and listed it as a $28,500-a-month rental. Now he is in contract to buy a high-floor apartment at yet another glass tower, One Madison Park, a 60-story skyscraper nearing completion on East 23rd Street facing Madison Square Park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ruimy's buying spree began as a way to take advantage of the euro's strength against the dollar. That was before the cracks in the residential market became apparent to most buyers. Mr. Ruimy said he was able to negotiate significant discounts from asking prices even then. Today, he said, the deteriorating market presents ''an opportunity.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We tend to be contrarian,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ruimy is the chief executive of Aerium Properties, which has offices in London, Luxembourg and Geneva, and has invested billions of dollars in commercial properties across Europe for private and institutional investors. The firm now manages more than $9 billion in commercial real estate in Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few years ago, Mr. Ruimy created a fund for wealthy individuals to invest in high-end apartments in Paris, London and, eventually, New York, to be rented out to other wealthy individuals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wendy Maitland, a broker at Brown Harris Stevens who specializes in expensive properties, said that the rental market for luxury apartments had remained solid during the downturn, as some well-heeled individuals found it prudent to rent rather than buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ruimy said he expected eventually to invest $250 million to $300 million in residential real estate. He said participation in his funds had remained strong as investors shifted money out of troubled investments. He said he had a long-term buy-and-hold strategy, using less borrowing than many real estate investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, Mr. Ruimy was in Los Angeles, looking at bank-owned commercial and residential properties. ''I am always looking for bargains everywhere,'' he said. ''It is a good time to be in real estate.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although central Essex County has remained an oasis from the worst of the nation's real estate meltdown, there is still the occasional housing horror story -- like the sorry tale of 572 Prospect Street in Maplewood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A gracious six-bedroom brick Tudor -- with wood floors, high ceilings, a one-bedroom carriage house and nanny's suite -- the house was put up for sale in the heady days of March 2007 at an asking price of $899,000. Within a month, the owners received an offer within $40,000 below the asking price. A deal never materialized, but in an era of bidding wars and easy credit -- when Maplewood homes routinely sold for 99 percent of asking price -- it was completely reasonable to expect that another buyer might come along to snatch it up soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead it sat on the market for more than two years, though today, listed at $649,000, the owners are in contract with a prospective buyer -- pending approval from the bank, which is negotiating with the sellers because the purchase price does not cover the full value of the remaining mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home's descent from a prized property to short sale is a tale of good intentions and bad timing. After initially pricing the home aggressively, the owners dropped the price to $874,000 in May of 2007, then took it off the market the following month. With the national real estate market's weakness beginning to seep into New Jersey, they instead tried to rent the home in November of 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when no tenants surfaced by the following spring, the home was re-listed last April at $779,000, then reduced the following month to $754,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Down, down, down went the asking price. In November, with the economy in free fall, it dropped to $649,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lesson of the home, according to Barbara Lawrence, the listing agent, is the importance of pricing correctly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Because if you put yourself in a position of having to chase the market, there's no way of knowing where it will lead,'' she said.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Housing Construction Fell In March, Dashing Hopes</span>
</div><div class="author">By JACK HEALY   </div><div>592 words</div><div>17 April 2009</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>10</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of new homes fell sharply last month, and foreclosures surged in the first quarter, according to reports released on Thursday, signaling a still-struggling housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government reported that new home starts fell 10.8 percent in March from February, just a month after a spike in new-home construction raised hopes that the country's housing market was beginning to make a comeback as credit conditions eased.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home construction in March fell to an annual rate of 510,000 units, the Commerce Department reported, less than expectations by economists of 540,000 units. It was the second-lowest level on record and 48.4 percent lower than housing starts in March 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's still no clear indication that the construction market is coming back,'' said Mike Larson, a housing analyst at Weiss Research. ''Even if companies want to start projects, they're having a harder time getting the money to do so. We're being overwhelmed by distressed inventory as well as regular sellers trying to get out of their homes. There's not a heck of a lot of incentive for builders to ramp up construction.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some housing experts say the decline in home building was a crucial step toward lowering the glut of unsold houses and condominiums on the market so that housing supply once again lines up with demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also on Thursday, the data firm RealtyTrac reported that foreclosure filings surged 9 percent, to 803,489 properties, in the first quarter of 2009. RealtyTrac said that foreclosure notices increased 17 percent in March from February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We saw a record level of foreclosure activity,'' James J. Saccacio, chief executive of RealtyTrac, said in a statement. He added that foreclosures would probably increase in the next months as temporary halts to foreclosures expired at banks and agencies like <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> and <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The flood of cheap foreclosed homes and distressed properties has helped push home prices lower across the country, especially in areas hit hardest by the housing downturn, like Southern California, Arizona and Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lure of cheap, plentiful houses and lower mortgage rates have drawn buyers back to the market, and an industry group says homes are more affordable than ever before. Interest rates on 30-year mortgage fell slightly to a nationwide average of 4.82 percent last week, according to data released Thursday by <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in March, single-family housing starts were unchanged at an annual rate of 358,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits, an indicator of future construction, fell 9 percent from February, to an annual rate of 513,000. Permits were issued at an annual rate of 932,000 in March 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the monthly drops in permits and new construction, some economists said they sensed that these indicators of the housing market were no longer tumbling sharply lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It does look to me like we're hitting a bottom,'' said Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics, about building permits. ''We're now seeing a restabilization at a much lower level. It doesn't mean they're about to rebound.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department also reported that first-time claims for unemployment insurance fell 53,000, to a seasonally adjusted 610,000 last week. The large decline caught economists by surprise, but they said that weekly jobless numbers are volatile.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While you can contact brokers directly -- THE six-bedroom Hamptons home belonging to Joanne Corzine, the former wife of Gov. Jon Corzine of New Jersey, was listed for $900,000. That was not the sale price, of course, but rather the asking rent for the summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late last month, a tenant whose identity is cloaked behind a confidentiality pact agreed to rent Ms. Corzine's place through September. ''In terms of available rentals it stood out,'' said the listing agent, Beate Moore of <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span>. Built in 1990, the traditional-style Sagaponack house occupies 6.6 acres and has landscaped lawns, a tennis court, a gym and 500 feet of ocean frontage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in a recession, it seems, the Hamptons still manage to attract the kind of people who do not flinch at spending nearly $6,600 a night on rent. And multimillion-dollar homes continue to sell, especially in the more desirable areas south of Route 27.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, however, a cloud of gloom has pervaded those thick Hamptons hedgerows. During the first quarter, the number of leases signed and the dollar volume of sales shrank to half of the levels from the similar period last year, said Rick Hoffman, the regional senior vice president for <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prospective tenants who might have felt pressure to snag a house by Presidents' Day are starting their search later, figuring that rents will drop as the summer approaches, agents say. Clients who used to lease a house from Memorial Day to Labor Day are now settling for a month, or -- in a phenomenon rarely seen before in the Hamptons -- even a week or two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the 20 years I've been doing this, this is the weakest rental market I've seen,'' said Jan Robinson, the owner of Hampton Homes, a local brokerage. Ms. Robinson said her rental business was down by 70 percent from last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, a Manhattan couple, Joshua Levine, 33, and Leigh Manheim, 31 -- he works in finance, she is in fashion -- had only three rental houses to choose from in their price range of around $30,000. But on a recent Saturday, they toured 11 houses, winnowed from a list of about 30, all with four bedrooms and a pool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next day Mr. Levine and Ms. Manheim, who will be sharing the rental with two other couples, heard about another house that rented for $40,000 last year and could now be had for $10,000 less. They took it. ''We got double the house we got last year,'' Mr. Levine said. The house has a living room with cathedral ceilings and access to a community tennis court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Owners who are willing to be flexible have a better chance of finding renters, agents say. Ms. Robinson, for example, found a tenant to rent an East Hampton house for two weeks, half the term the owner was looking for.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One house in Westhampton Beach that was listed for $50,000 a month for July and August was rented when the owner accepted an offer of $75,000 for both months, said Judy Carroll, an agent at the Marketplace, a family-owned brokerage based in Westhampton Beach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Owners are making other concessions -- like extending the lease through the end of September, say, or agreeing to absorb landscaping costs. One house rented after the owner covered the furniture with white slipcovers, said Susan Breitenbach, an associate broker at Corcoran. Many owners ''are spoiled,'' she said. ''They are not used to having to do stuff like that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since sales have slowed, some of the high-end homes that were built on speculation and would have sold briskly in a stronger market are being furnished and marketed as rentals, Ms. Breitenbach said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slowdown in the rental market is mirrored in the sales market, where prices have dropped to 2006 levels. Preliminary first-quarter data from Corcoran shows that median prices have declined by about 20 percent over the same period last year, Mr. Hoffman said. In 2008, the median price for homes on the South Fork (including the Hamptons and Shelter Island) was $891,000, according to Corcoran.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first two months of this year, 60 sales were recorded in the Hamptons, compared with 107 in the first two months of last year and 330 in the similar period in 2007, said Susan Vincennie, general manager of Long Island Profiles, a company in Brightwaters, N.Y., that publishes recorded real estate information. The median price of homes sold in January and February of this year was $675,000, compared with $840,000 in January and February 2008, and $999,000 in the 2007 period, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventory has increased 6 percent since the first quarter of 2008, according to Mr. Hoffman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some buyers are finding bargains -- relatively speaking. A Mediterranean-style house on Cobb Road in Water Mill with five bedrooms went on the market two years ago for $7.6 million. Two weeks ago, it was sold for $5 million, said Chip Dineen, an agent at <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span>, which had the listing. Other houses have sparked multiple bids, including one on Toylsome Place in Southampton with 7,100 square feet that was listed for $7 million. After a series of price reductions, it recently sold for just under $5 million, he said. The winners were so eager to strike a deal that they signed a contract without waiting for a title report or inspection, Mr. Dineen said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such sharp reductions suggest that ''the property owners weren't being realistic in their pricing to begin with,'' Mr. Hoffman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most transactions are occurring at much lower prices, with 70 percent of the deals under $1 million, he said. Perhaps that's because financing is harder to come by and the number of all-cash buyers is smaller than it used to be, even in the Hamptons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That trend is likely to make it tougher to sell houses built on speculation, especially if they are north of the highway, farther from the ocean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The days of spec development with extremely large housing is over for now,'' said Jonathan J. Miller, the chief executive of Miller Samuel, a Manhattan appraisal company that produces the Hamptons market report for Prudential Douglas Elliman. ''Financing for those properties is generally not available, and there is an oversupply and a concern that the demand is not going to be there for a while, given the changing employment structure and compensation in the financial services industry.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, bargain-hunters are often willing to be patient. David J. Raimondo, 47, of Shoreham, N.Y., has been driving up and down Dune Road along the ocean from Westhampton Beach to Southampton for several years, searching for a deeply discounted house. ''There's no rush,'' said Mr. Raimondo, a lawyer. ''I'm looking to spend between $500,000 and $1.5 million. If it's $1.5 million and it's a reduction from $2 million, that might be right for me.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes listed around $500,000 represent the lower end of the market, and many of the listings at that level have two bedrooms and only one bathroom. A cottage on Parrish Road in Southampton that is listed for $475,000 has three bedrooms and two bathrooms but the kitchen is in the basement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the owner is asking only $23,000 more than he paid for the 1,500-square-foot house, it seemed overpriced to Wendy Reynolds, 33, a seaplane pilot who transports wealthy weekend commuters to the Hamptons. ''It's smaller than some of the others,'' she said at the recent open house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jay Litvack, a shoe manufacturer who lives in Roslyn, N.Y., said he looked at more than 150 Hamptons houses over the last year. Initially, he intended to spend as much as $1.2 million, but by last year he had settled on a limit of $950,000. A year ago, a four-bedroom house in the Three Mile Harbor section of East Hampton caught his eye, but it had a price tag of $1.3 million. In October, the price dropped below $1million, and by February he was able to buy it for $825,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like many houses that are selling in this market, it has an updated kitchen and bathrooms. ''A lot of houses need a lot of work,'' he said. ''People today don't want to do the work.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Litvack had no problem getting a mortgage, but 36 hours before he was scheduled to close, his lender, <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>, asked him to increase his down payment of 25 percent by another five percentage points, or $40,000. Fortunately, Mr. Litvack said, he was able to come up with the cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for other potential buyers, the lending terms may be too onerous. ''Thirty percent down is a lot for people to come up with in this marketplace,'' said Ms. Robinson of Hampton Homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Gary Wohl, an agent at the East Hampton office of Brown Harris Stevens, said he remained optimistic that the market would pick up. ''There's a lot of value here right now,'' he said as he showed off a 5,000-square-foot spec house on a quiet East Hampton street whose price has been reduced to $3.7 million from nearly $4 million. But people with unrealistic expectations are bound to be disappointed, Mr. Wohl added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's never going to be a fire sale out here,'' he said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By JOSH BARBANEL   </div><div>1140 words</div><div>9 April 2009</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While sales have picked up a bit in some suffering housing markets in the West, creating a glimmer of hope that home prices nationwide may be approaching a bottom, the Manhattan real estate market has just begun a steep slide. It parallels the decline in New York's financial services industry, and housing analysts say it may continue long after other markets heal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apartment prices have once more become the talk of the town in Manhattan, but this time the talk is of uncertainty and falling numbers. While brokers say they are seeing more activity lately, especially from first-time buyers taking advantage of lower interest rates, housing analysts are predicting a prolonged slump in prices and sales that could last as long as four or five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this year's first quarter, sales of co-ops and condominiums in Manhattan plunged nearly 60 percent from the first quarter of 2008. Average co-op prices fell as much as 24 percent in the same period, according to various market reports released last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condo prices have held up so far, but only because buyers who went into contract long before the downturn were closing on newly completed condominium buildings. But now few new contracts are being signed on unfinished condominiums, and some buyers have been renegotiating contracts or are trying to back out of them. Co-ops and condos make up 98 percent of the residential properties for sale in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stress is most severe at the high end of the market. There are 350 apartments and town houses for sale in Manhattan with asking prices of more than $10 million, and inventory has been growing. It would take about six years at the current sales rate to absorb all those listings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For the last three years, it was the bigger the better,'' said Dolly Lenz, a broker at Prudential Douglas Elliman. ''Now the key words are smaller, livable and affordable. Before no one asked what the maintenance was. Now everyone wants to know.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan was spared some of the housing problems the rest of the country faced during this downturn. The mortgage foreclosure rate in Manhattan remains low even today. While thousands of condos were built here, most were bought by homeowners, not speculators, as was common in Miami and other oversaturated markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Manhattan housing prices were driven higher by record earnings and bonuses on Wall Street, and they fell hard when the music stopped last fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The quick fall in prices is shown in the experience of Abigail Disney, a philanthropist and documentary filmmaker, who a year ago put her sprawling 17-room co-op on West End Avenue on the market for $13.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With trophy homes commanding ever higher prices from the titans of finance, Ms. Disney priced the apartment at 20 percent more than she had paid for it only a few months earlier. Harry Belafonte, the singer and actor, had created the huge space many years earlier by breaking through the walls of two smaller apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a series of price cuts, Ms. Disney has finally found buyers for the property, for just under $7.5 million, a 46 percent discount from her initial asking price. But to make a deal she agreed to restore the walls and convert it back into two apartments and sell it to two buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite government efforts to ease credit around the country, the market in New York is being starved by a limited availability of credit, especially for jumbo mortgages, which are loans of more than $729,750. More than half of all apartment sales in Manhattan are above even the expanded limits of conventional mortgages, which carry lower interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan J. Miller, an appraiser who prepares quarterly reports on Manhattan, said the market could continue to fall through this year and next, especially if credit remained tight for most buyers. After that, he said, it could take several more years to work through the excess inventory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing recovery will also depend on the state of the economy, which many forecasters say will take a disproportionate toll on New York City before the recession ends. In New York, the financial industry accounts for more than 30 percent of all wages, and at least some of the wages of half of all very high income households, according to the New York City comptroller's office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While employment fell nationwide last year, the number of jobs actually grew in New York City until September. Since then, the city lost nearly 85,000 jobs through January, and the comptroller's office has forecast a loss of 121,000 jobs in 2009 and another 83,000 in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condominiums under construction have been hit particularly hard, especially because new mortgage rules have made it difficult for buyers to get conventional loans unless 70 percent of the apartments in a building are in contract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This has left many developers scrambling to convert condominium projects to rentals or provide alternative financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 99 John Street in Lower Manhattan, where the <span class="companylink">Rockrose Development Corporation</span> is converting a 27-story prewar Art Deco rental building into hundreds of condominiums, buyers were offered a chance to ''rent to own,'' and a promise that Rockrose would buy back an apartment after five years at 110 percent of the purchase price. The developer also began offering the apartments in bulk to investors, in packages of 15 apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the late 1980s, a surge in condominium construction in New York created a glut of condo apartments. Prices peaked in 1989, declined steeply in 1991, bottomed out in 1993 and stabilized in 1995 and 1996.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shaun Osher, the chief executive of Core Group Marketing, said he had begun to see more activity this spring, but at much lower prices, with luxury apartment prices off as much as 40 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miller said that during the last big real estate downturn, when studio apartments were so cheap that he considered buying one on a credit card, people thought the luxury market would never come back. ''Conspicuous consumption was out of vogue in 1991,'' he said. ''The market was back by 1997 or 1998.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN December, when Michael and Randi Reh went into contract on a $650,000 three-bedroom two-and-a-half-bath town house at the Villages West, a gated community in Melville, they set a closing date of April 1. Ms. Reh, who works in pharmaceutical sales, was due to give birth in early March. They planned for a month's time with their newborn son before having to relocate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a 20 percent down payment and a stellar credit score, they weren't worried about the timing of the deal. They would even be willing, if they completed the sale of their Great Neck co-op early and construction was finished on the town house (among the last handful in the 259-home development), to push it up by a few days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What they didn't expect was to be forced to close almost immediately after the baby's birth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We were caught in the middle of economic forces, very ultraconservative bank practices and a builder that was using very strong-armed tactics,'' said Mr. Reh, a marketing consultant, calling the six-week experience ''harrowing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a large category of buyers in the current economic climate, the Rehs' story is emblematic. Some are watching in disbelief as the credit crisis dries up loans that they had thought would be a cinch. Others, their mortgage commitments vaporizing at the 11th hour, are being forced to scramble to reapply for financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michele Kahn, a partner at Manhattan-based firm of Kahn &amp; Goldberg who is the Rehs' lawyer, said that ''largely because the banks now scrutinize everything, we could not get clearance to close,'' which used to be a formality that happened in ''a matter of days.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Because the bank couldn't get its act together and the developer was playing hardball,'' insisting on a closing before the final mortgage paperwork was in hand, the Rehs -- who had in the meantime sold their co-op and scheduled a move-out date -- ''almost lost their down payment'' and contract to buy the town house, she said, not to mention a place to live.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was not ideal,'' Mr. Reh said. If closing had not happened on the day demanded by the developer, ''we were in jeopardy of losing a lot of money; we would have been left without a lot of options and a one-week-old baby.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bank finally gave clearance on March 18, the evening before the early deadline set by the developer, and Mr. Reh left to close on the town house just after the bris for his son, Aidan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Even highly qualified people are having difficulty getting routine mortgage loans,'' Ms. Kahn asserted, ''and it's ruining deals and hurting commerce and the housing market.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vincent C. Tenety III, a lawyer for the developer, Susan Barbash, did not return calls seeking comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Debra Schuman, a mortgage broker and president of Lane Mortgage and Lane Realty, a Melville-based mortgage and real estate brokerage firm, represented Ms. Barbash in the Rehs' transaction. She said that although lenders were ''taking a lot more time than they used to,'' and required ''a lot more documentation,'' the Rehs' road to closing followed ''a natural course'' and ''was very flexible.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They were lucky enough to have a new house, a new baby and a bris all at the same time,'' was Ms. Schuman's assessment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other professionals saw consumers as having little leverage. Anna Beigelman, owner broker of Exit Realty in Merrick, said that ''banks are being stringent'' and ''credit has to be sparkling clean.'' Similarly, Leslie Feifer, a residential real estate lawyer at Jaspan Schlesinger, a Garden City firm, said that ''with such a large supply of homes for sale and lenders tightening their reins, it is not easy to obtain a mortgage these days.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Even when a buyer obtains a commitment from a lender,'' she added, ''there is no guarantee that the commitment will stand at the time of closing.'' More conditions can be added; commitments can be arbitrarily broken or changed; loan programs can be suddenly terminated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another case in point on Long Island was that of Steve and Debbie Sottile of Islandia, Ms. Feifer's clients, who in July offered $525,000 for a four-bedroom four-bath home in Smithtown. The offer was accepted, and the Sottiles expected to close the next month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They received a firm mortgage commitment, but then a title report showed violations that the seller's lawyer needed to resolve, Ms. Feifer said. The delay pushed the deal into September, at which point their mortgage program was terminated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Things just started to fall apart right as we were getting into closing,'' said Mr. Sottile, an electrician.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fearing the loss of their $10,000 down payment, the Sottiles obtained an extension to secure another mortgage, all the while doubting that the friends who had bought their Islandia home would in turn be able to delay the deal. In order to do so, the friends needed to extend the lease on the apartment they were renting and get an extension on their own mortgage commitment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Sottiles closed on their new home in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Once all the ducks were in a row and we finally went to closing,'' Mr. Sottile said, ''it went very smoothly. If we didn't have such a friendly transaction on our end, it could have been much worse.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TRADITIONALLY, there is happy news about the residential market in springtime -- always its busiest season. Here is this year's bulletin: Home prices have declined so much in the state that average buyers can actually afford to buy houses (if they can get a mortgages, of course).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, as of the latest statewide report from the Otteau Valuation Group, there were six towns with less than six months' worth of unsold inventory. (But there were also six others with enough houses on the market that it would take 99 months -- more than eight years -- to sell them all at the current pace.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These tidings may seem underwhelming in their gladness, but they are the most salutary available as prices continue to slide and the inventory of houses for sale blips upward this season, according to the market trend analyst Jeffrey G. Otteau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House prices right now are descending at the rate of about a percentage point a month, according to Mr. Otteau, whose company is based in New Brunswick. At seminars that he conducted for brokers in March, Mr. Otteau predicted an additional nine point drop in prices by the end of the year, and no likely upturn until 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At this point, the so-called housing affordability index is the only measure showing improvement, by Mr. Otteau's computations, which are based on sales contract data. The index, which compares median income with the median housing price, recently shifted in home buyers' collective favor, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in 2000, the index was pegged at 122 percent, meaning a buyer with the median income earned 22 percent more than needed to own and maintain the median-priced home. This assumes that housing costs 30 percent of income, which is a standard assumption, Mr. Otteau explained in a recent telephone interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By 2005, when housing prices were reaching their peak, the median buyer could afford only 92 percent of the cost of owning the median home, he said, and by 2006, it was only 81 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2007, when prices fell, ''affordability'' was back up to 87 percent, and by June 2008, housing was again 100 percent ''affordable,'' under the formula.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, Mr. Otteau said, the market has ''overcorrected,'' and this will continue. The index is 107 percent and rising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also suggested that towns that have commuter rail stations -- Montclair, for instance, has three -- continue to be in the best position to attract buyers, once the economy improves and the New York metropolitan area stops ''leaking jobs.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Housing is very affordable, and interest rates are still low,'' he said. ''The pace of sales is starting to rise a little bit, but over all, we predict the spring selling season will show very modest gains'' in terms of the number of contracts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, several real estate brokers in northern New Jersey noted that the number of homes on the market was rising again, although not as fast as in a ''normal'' spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example in Millburn Township, which includes Short Hills, Karen Eastman Bigos, a broker with the Towne Realty Group, said there were 117 homes for sale as of March 21, the first full day of spring. ''We are seeing a little buzz'' of buyer interest, she said. ''Several homes are getting offers, even multiple offers -- but prices are not high.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Bigos said the picture was similar in Summit, where there were 136 homes listed for sale. Livingston had 151 homes; South Orange, 124 homes; Maplewood, 145; and Chatham, 148.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of those communities, Millburn had the smallest inventory of homes on the market for a month or more. Its unsold inventory would take six months to sell at the current pace if no other homes were added to the market, according to Otteau statistics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Montclair, Julie Salmon, an agent with Coldwell Banker, said that there were more properties on the market in February and March than during those months a year ago but that fewer contracts had been signed. At the end of March, there were 54 houses for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A colleague, Linda Grotenstein, said she perceived the market as ''wild and crazy.'' She added: ''Some houses are on the market for a few weeks, and then there is a flurry of activity and bids. Every week is different.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based on the most recent Otteau market report, the six communities in the state with the shortest time frames to sell their inventories -- and therefore the healthiest markets -- were Midland Park, Fanwood, Dumont, Boonton, Hanover and New Providence. Of those towns, all but Dumont and Hanover have train stations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The six communities with the 99-month inventories are Alpine, Garfield, Oradell, Avalon, Lavalette and Seaside Heights. They are among the most affluent communities in New Jersey, the nation's second-wealthiest state, Mr. Otteau noted. ''This is understandable,'' he added, ''because homes that are less affordable, those priced above $1 million, are the ones sitting on the market the longest.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Statewide, there is a 42-month inventory of homes priced above $1 million; for listings at $2 million or more, there is an 84-month (seven-year) supply, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his recent presentations for subscribing real estate professionals, Mr. Otteau pointed out that in many communities home prices still had not dipped nearly as much as they gained during the real estate boom years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, the Otteau company reported that in Holmdel Township in Monmouth County, where home prices fell 3.98 percent in the last year alone, the median sale price remains 8.3 percent above where it was five years ago.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In these desperate days in American retailing, mall owners are seizing on a new gimmick: wave-making machines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A half-dozen malls across the country are planning to install a huge contraption called the Flowrider in vacant retail space. Where once people shopped for three-packs of underwear or sheet sets, they are now turning up in flip-flops and shorts to surf an artificial patch of ocean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However good a business that turns out to be for the company controlling the Flowrider, it is also a sign of the times. With major retail chains like <span class="companylink">Linens 'n Things</span> and <span class="companylink">Circuit City</span> closing stores or disappearing altogether, mall and shopping center vacancies are soaring, forcing landlords to find new ways to lure traffic and stave off decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Downscale chains that landlords once kept out of shopping centers are suddenly being shown the welcome mat. Temporary stores are popping up. Once-small retailers are being invited to take over big spaces, while the strongest national chains are seizing the moment to move into new cities at low rents. And vast mall spaces formerly occupied by department stores may soon be carved up or turned into community colleges and dance studios.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Landlords are scared,'' said Suzanne E. Mulvee, a real estate strategist with Property &amp; Portfolio Research. ''Part of the reason they're scared is dark space doesn't pay.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the nation's stores report March sales results this week, the numbers are likely to be down yet again -- especially for department stores and mall chains, which have been the weakest performers for months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That does not bode well for mall owners. As more stores have closed, mall vacancies are at their highest point in almost a decade, according to Reis, a research company, which said the vacancy rate at the end of 2008 was 7.1 percent, compared with 5.8 percent at the end of 2007. Other analysts have slightly lower figures, but all agree that vacancies are rising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For some retailers, the brutal environment means new opportunities. That is especially true for the one major retail category faring well nowadays -- discounters, like dollar stores and <span class="companylink">Big Lots</span>, that are suddenly moving into more prominent locales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They were shunned for five years by the landlord community,'' said Spence J. Mehl, senior vice president at RCS Real Estate Advisors. ''And now everybody's knocking on their door and they're cutting incredibly aggressive deals, because they can.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of all the vacant spaces, the most difficult to fill are anchors -- those big stores at the periphery of a mall. In recent months, <span class="companylink">Macy's</span>, Sears, <span class="companylink">Dillard's</span>, Mervyns and Steve &amp; Barry's have closed big mall stores. Last week, the bankrupt Gottschalks department store chain began liquidation sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greg Maloney, president and chief executive of the retail group at <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>, a real estate brokerage firm, said that to fill empty anchor spaces, landlords were getting creative and were considering bringing in grocery stores, medical facilities, dance studios and even community or technical colleges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think you're going to see a lot more of that,'' Mr. Maloney said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several schools -- like New River Community College in Virginia and Hagerstown Community College's Center for Continuing Education in Maryland -- have been holding classes in malls for years. But industry professionals say the trend is likely to accelerate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With Americans buying less, many chains are asking mall owners for rent reductions, and are sometimes receiving them. That adds to the malls' financial woes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the nation's largest mall owners, <span class="companylink">General Growth Properties</span>, is laden with more than $25 billion of debt, has missed payment deadlines on its bonds, and is trying to avoid filing for bankruptcy protection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Landlords are willing to lower rents for their best retailers -- but only those that can prove financial distress. The landlords may not be able to play hardball for long, though. More major chains are expected to file for bankruptcy this year, leaving behind empty stores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this economy, few chains need spaces as large as the ones coming onto the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I talk to landlords and they're taking an old <span class="companylink">Dillard's</span> box and putting a <span class="companylink">Best Buy</span> on the top level and a <span class="companylink">Dick's Sporting Goods</span> on the bottom,'' said Joseph Feldman, a retailing analyst with the Telsey Advisory Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Researchers who study land use point out that while the recession set off the latest round of vacancies, the problems faced by mall owners and developers have been building for more than a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There was really no relationship between development and the increase in consumer spending,'' said Stacy Mitchell, a senior researcher with the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, an advocacy group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between 1990 and 2005, consumer spending per capita rose 14 percent, adjusted for inflation, yet retail space per capita in the United States doubled, said Stacy Mitchell, a senior researcher at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, an advocacy group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In her view, that created too much store space even for a good economy, and then retailers were hit by the recession. ''All of this overdevelopment has pulled the rug out from under them,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While mall owners may be batting around plenty of unusual ideas, the Flowrider -- a 10-feet-tall wave machine that sends 35,000 gallons of water gushing over a slope at more than 30 miles an hour -- is among the most unusual.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The device is the centerpiece of a cult sport that got its start in water parks and on cruise ships. Lately, a retail chain called <span class="companylink">Adrenalina</span>, which sells gear for extreme sports like skydiving and kite-surfing, transferred the concept to retail stores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the machines can draw enthusiastic crowds, <span class="companylink">Adrenalina</span> is getting sweet deals from landlords. <span class="companylink">Adrenalina</span> executives said some mall owners were paying to install the Flowrider, upwards of $2 million, just to get the extra traffic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They know that we'll pull people from a further distance than their regular tenants,'' said Jeffrey Geller, president and chief operating officer of <span class="companylink">Adrenalina</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An <span class="companylink">Adrenalina</span> store that opened last month at the Shops at Willow Bend in Plano, Tex., is already a popular destination. Steven Coyne, an <span class="companylink">Adrenalina</span> district manager in Dallas, said that in the few weeks the store has been open, the Flowrider has garnered repeat customers -- and stupefied gawkers who cannot believe people are riding waves inside a mall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The funniest question I've ever had,'' he said, ''was, 'Are those real people?' ''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hard times have come to the Manhattan real estate market, according to a series of quarterly sales reports to be issued on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Relatively few apartments are selling, and when they do, prices are down 20 percent or more from a year ago. Large, luxurious apartments on Fifth Avenue, Park Avenue and Central Park West, and new condominiums with many unsold apartments, have been particularly hard hit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One report, prepared by two brokerage firms, Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead Property, showed the number of closings of condos and co-ops down by 58 percent in the first quarter of 2009, compared with the same period a year earlier, as buyers were scared off by worries over the economy, portfolio losses and fears that apartment prices would continue to fall in the months ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop in sales was worse than the decline in the auto industry. In March, sales at <span class="companylink">General Motors</span> were off 45 percent from March 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report showed that average condo and co-op apartment prices were down 11 percent from the first quarter of last year, to $1.5 million. Co-op prices were off 27 percent, to $975,000, and condominium prices down by 4 percent. but were up from the last quarter, as buyers continued to close on new condominiums for which contracts were signed many months ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of sales of apartments over $10 million plummeted, by 87 percent, compared with a year ago, when sales of apartments at some of the city's most expensive condominiums, at 15 Central Park West and at the Plaza Hotel, were completed, the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only one co-op closed for more than $20 million, compared with eight in the same quarter a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although details in the various reports differed -- one put the decline in sales at 52 percent and another at 48 percent -- they suggested a market still traumatized by a collapse in confidence last fall after the bankruptcy of <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span>, even as sales have begun to stabilize in far more troubled real estate markets in the West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Consumer confidence is the killer,'' said Dottie Herman, president of the Prudential Douglas Elliman brokerage firm. ''People are scared. They have never seen anything like this.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan Miller, an appraiser who prepares the market report for Prudential Douglas Elliman, said he has tracked a series of statistics on inventory over the last decade that show the market declining more steeply than ever before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of apartments on the market, 10,445, was 34 percent above the inventory level a year ago, he said, and 15 percent above the inventory last quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average number of days that apartments stayed on the market had increased to a record 170, nearly half a year, up 16.5 percent from the first quarter last year and 7 percent from the last quarter. And when buyers did sign contracts, they got a discount of 12 percent from the most recent listed asking price, up from 7.3 percent from the fourth quarter of 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Elliman report showed that average and median sales prices for all co-ops and condos were up a bit from a year ago, but Mr. Miller said the figures were distorted by closings of expensive new condominiums (even though few contracts for new condominiums are currently being signed).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said a more significant figure was the sale price of existing co-op and condominium apartments, which was down 20.9 percent, to $732,000, since the first quarter of last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hall F. Willkie, the president of Brown Harris Stevens, said that despite the declines, there were some positive signs. Activity has picked up in each of the last few months, he said, with the number of active buyers and the number of contracts signed rising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Pam Liebman, the president of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, which also issued a report, predicted that as activity picks up, prices will erode even more. While sales of the most expensive apartments and apartments in new condos are down sharply, she said that sales were increasing among lower-priced apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said sales of one-bedrooms and studios were up, as were sales to first-time buyers, who can purchase an apartment without having to sell something else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Manhattan has become affordable again,'' she said. ''It is a lot more affordable than it was six months ago.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE incredible shrinking real estate market has arrived right here in Manhattan, and now that the first quarter is over, not even the most ebullient broker will be able to dispute it. Now everyone will have no choice but to adjust to a market where buyers aren't buying and sellers aren't selling, new developments have stalled and mortgages remain scarce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The evidence of this decline is likely to arrive later this week when a series of market reports are released, documenting in detail the decline in sales in every type of apartment in every neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, the Manhattan real estate market was an $18 billion business. So far this year, sales are off more than 60 percent, according to a preliminary review of first-quarter figures. That is steeper than the year-to-year decline in auto sales in February in the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop-off in activity, especially among the most expensive apartments favored by the barons of Wall Street, led to steep drops in city real estate transfer taxes, forced brokerage firms to close offices, led to soaring inventory and left buyers and sellers uncertain about how to proceed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, it seems, the market will be left to people who really need to move and who really need to buy. ''If you are going to be there long term, and you need a place to live, go for it -- if your time horizon is five or more years,'' said Dolly Lenz, a broker at Prudential Douglas Elliman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right now, she said, there is a standoff in the market, with buyers expecting huge discounts and sellers resisting. ''The buyers and sellers have gotten different memos of what the price should be and no one is budging,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michelle Kleier of Gumley Haft Kleier said her firm was still making sales, but of smaller apartments at lower prices than she was used to, typically to first-time home buyers and parents buying apartments for their children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even as the market seems to be heading in only one direction, there are exceptions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few weeks ago, Laurie Tisch, the daughter of Preston Robert Tisch, the late chairman and co-owner of the <span class="companylink">Loews Corporation</span>, paid $29 million for a two-bedroom apartment on the 13th floor of 834 Fifth Avenue, one of the great apartment buildings on the avenue. Her apartment is just below the triplex once owned by Laurance S. Rockefeller and bought by Rupert Murdoch for $44 million in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the sale to Ms. Tisch was a rarity in the current market. So far the number of co-op sales in the first quarter is off by nearly 60 percent from the same quarter in 2008, with the total value of sales off 70 percent. Only 10 co-ops costing more than $4 million sold in the first quarter, a decline of 80 percent compared with the same quarter last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condo sales also fell sharply, but because many of the sales that closed were in new buildings where expensive apartments had been in contract for many months, average sale prices actually rose. So far, all sales have totaled nearly $1.8 billion during the first quarter compared with about $5.1 billion in the same period last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 1980s, a glut of unsold Manhattan apartments in failed projects undermined the market for years. No one knows whether this will be the pattern this time around or whether the market will rebound more quickly if the economy, the stock market and the banks bounce back later this year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Executives at <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> made it clear that they wanted to give back the government aid the firm had received. A bill winding its way through Congress that would impose a 90 percent tax on bonuses for banks that receive government assistance reinforces that desire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So let's assume that regulators give Goldman the go-ahead. The question would be, would the firm want to replenish some of the money by selling new stock to the public?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Goldman still needs to reckon with Warren Buffett.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Berkshire Hathaway</span>, led by Mr. Buffett, injected $5 billion into Goldman last September in return for preferred shares. That, combined with a common stock offering, helped bolster Goldman's capital in the wake of the <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> bankruptcy. But Mr. Buffett's involvement came with a condition that could qualify him for some kind of compensation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That sounds ominously similar to the so-called ratchets granted to the big pension funds and sovereign wealth funds that invested in <span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span> and <span class="companylink">Washington Mutual</span> during the credit crisis. A ratchet is a feature that allows those investors' stakes to be recalculated should the company raise more capital at a lower price. Investors like the protection it offers, but it's often bad news for the recipient and its shareholders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rights <span class="companylink">Washington Mutual</span> gave to the private equity firm T.P.G. arguably scared off other potential investors before the bank folded and was handed to <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span> by regulators. <span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span>, meanwhile, had to dole out almost a third of the $8.5 billion it raised last summer to cover a ratchet that <span class="companylink">Temasek Holdings</span> of Singapore had previously negotiated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal Goldman struck with the <span class="companylink">Oracle</span> of Omaha is nowhere near as onerous. Unlike others, Goldman's miniratchet isn't linked to the price Berkshire negotiated for its preferred stock and warrants. Instead, it requires two triggers. First, Goldman would have to sell new shares at a discount of 5 percent or more to the stock price at the time. That's certainly possible -- it offered an 8 percent discount last September when it sold its stock during one of the most volatile weeks of the year. The average secondary share sale dangled at a little less than a 5 percent discount in 2008 and just breached that so far this year, according to the research firm Dealogic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second, the discount only applies if Goldman sells stock to a small group of select investors. A broader sale -- like a rights offering to its shareholders -- wouldn't set off the ratchet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That gives Goldman a good deal of leeway. It's not as clean as <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>'s ratchet-free $9 billion investment from Mitsubishi UFJ of Japan. But in this market, the fewer shackles the better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Housing Rebound</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Upticks in new and existing home sales in February suggest the housing market may be hitting bottom. Prices are close to their long-term averages in terms of multiple of buyers' earnings, and may decline only modestly. That's good news for banks' asset portfolios -- and the global economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After three years of relentless declines, demand for housing appears to be rising toward supply. As the sharp rise in mortgage refinancing demonstrates, that's partly an effect of historically low mortgage rates for prime credits eligible for a <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> or <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> guarantee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, the first stirrings of increased home sales should be the beginning of a stronger overall trend. Only a surge in new building by housing companies wishing to convert vacant land into income could delay the revival. That's why a jump in February housing starts, up 22 percent from January, was somewhat disquieting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">True, prices may continue to decline for some months, if only because there's still so much inventory. Given the gigantic budget deficit, interest rates might rise from their current very low levels, which would reduce housing affordability and depress prices further. But if the latest government stimulus brings a stable economy and just a modest revival of inflation, that would increase incomes and housing affordability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising home sales combined with slowing price declines will put a floor under the value of the financial system's housing-related assets. That would be excellent news if it put the banking system in better health to proffer credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At that point, it will be possible to unwind the current government subsidies to housing and the housing finance market without short-term adverse economic effects. Moves like closing <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> and limiting the tax deduction for mortgage interest would become feasible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These would help reduce the long-term budget deficit while restoring housing financing to a sound, free-market foundation and deter any future housing bubbles. ANTONY CURRIE and MARTIN HUTCHINSON</p>

</div><div class="author">By JACK HEALY   </div><div>513 words</div><div>24 March 2009</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>The New York Times on the Web</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes in the United States showed unexpected strength in February, offering a glimmer that the tumbling housing market may be searching for a bottom even as economists brace for another wave of foreclosures driven by rising job losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors reported on Monday that sales of existing homes rose 5.1 percent in February after a 5 percent decline in January. Home sales in the Northeast, South, West and Midwest all gained ground for February as buyers scooped up foreclosure properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are close to seeing a bottom in both new and existing home sales,'' Michael T. Darda, chief economist at MKM Partners, wrote in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But all real estate is local, and whether the housing market has begun to finally scrape bottom remains a question of location, location, location.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists and real-estate experts said the worst-hit parts of the country looked like they were starting to emerge from the wreckage of the housing bust and a tide of foreclosures. Other markets like New York or Washington, where prices have not tumbled so starkly, will probably face more stagnant sales and sliding prices in the months ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the West, where home prices have dropped 30 percent from last February, homes sales rose 30 percent last month from a year earlier. In the Northeast, where housing prices have only dropped 4.8 percent, to $251,200, over the last year, sales are down 15 percent for the year. ''The areas that fall the fastest are going to recover,'' said Guy Cecala, publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance. ''There's going to be a floor established. Seven hundred thousand dollar houses are $250,000 -- that's what's bringing people back into the markets.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama administration and the Federal Reserve have introduced aggressive moves to try to lower borrowing costs, keep homeowners out of foreclosure, and stem two years' of losses in the housing market, which lies at the center of the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, President Obama unveiled a $275 billion plan to help as many as nine million homeowners refinance or avoid foreclosure using a variety of incentives to lenders and homeowners. The administration also included an $8,000 tax credit for first-time homebuyers in the stimulus package.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And last week, the Federal Reserve, which has already cut overnight interest rates to nearly zero, announced it would buy some $1 trillion in government debt and mortgage-backed securities in an effort to chip away at mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nationwide average for a 30-year fixed mortgage is 5.08 percent compared with 5.62 percent a year ago, according to Bankrate, and many lenders are offering loans with interest rates near 4.75 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors' group reported that the median home price in February was $165,400, slightly higher than a revised $164,800 in January, but down 15 percent from a year ago. Median home prices peaked at $230,100 in July 2006.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ALL across Miami, images of the real estate bust are on display -- in the empty condominium towers, the for-sale signs and the posted foreclosure notices. But on Watson Island, a diamond-shaped piece of land between downtown Miami and South Beach, there are big plans in the works.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since November, workers have been dredging the waters and building a sea wall to prepare for a deepwater marina that will be the focal point of Island Gardens, a $640 million mixed-use project being developed by the Flagstone Property Group. The development will include two luxury hotels, private residences, a botanical garden and dozens of restaurants and boutiques.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ambitious project is the rare exception these days in Miami, where rampant building and speculation combined to make the city a vivid example of the real estate crisis. While the downturn has stymied many developments, the Island Gardens project seems to hark back to a sunnier time with its promise of luxury living.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Island Gardens, with Eric K. Kuhne as the architect, will cover 11 acres. The 50-slip marina, called Super-Yacht Harbour, will accommodate yachts up to 450 feet long, one of the few places around to do so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Shangri-La hotel will have 150 guest rooms and suites designed by Piero Lissoni. The hotel will have a pool, a 14,500-square-foot spa and views of downtown Miami. On top of the hotel will be the Residences, 98 units of one- to four-bedrooms that will be sold on a fractional basis. The price, $225,000 to $1 million for a one-eighth share consisting of 45 days a year, includes access to a small fleet of yachts. Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts will manage the Residences. Another hotel is planned for the site, although the operator has not yet been announced. There will also be a series of narrow streets lined with designer boutiques and restaurants that lead to the waterfront.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City officials say they hope that the development will establish Miami as an international yachting destination -- a Monaco on Biscayne Bay -- and create hundreds of jobs to help the moribund local economy. ''I'm an absolute fan of the idea,'' said Marc D. Sarnoff, a Miami city commissioner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Mehmet Bayraktar, the chief executive of Flagstone Property, a little-known company based in Miami that was awarded the project by the city, it is a bold bid to make a name for the company in the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a rare opportunity,'' said Mr. Bayraktar, who has developed similar mixed-use projects in his native Turkey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are great risks, especially in an uncertain economy. Citing the glut of condos and hotels in Miami, Lewis M. Goodkin, the president of Goodkin Consulting, a real estate and financial advisory firm in Miami, said, ''the problem is likely to worsen rather than improve.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Half a dozen luxury hotels have opened in the Miami area in the last two years, representing more than 870 rooms. And existing luxury hotels have been refurbished recently, like the 1,500-room Fontainebleau, which underwent $1 billion in renovations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are more rooms in this town than are needed,'' said Greg Masin, a senior director of retail services for Cushman &amp; Wakefield.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bayraktar dismisses any naysayers. Citing its desirable location and luxury yachting lifestyle, he said Island Gardens ''stands apart because it is one of a kind.'' He concedes that the downturn has slowed his financing, but says it has allowed him to save at least 10 percent on construction costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, Mr. Bayraktar said, about 20 percent of the fractional shares have already been sold at the Residences. That is in keeping with his plans, which he said from the beginning assumed slow and steady sales over four and a half years. ''We never planned that we would be sold out in two weeks,'' Mr. Bayraktar said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, he said, Flagstone is in rent discussions for about 40 percent of the 221,000 square feet of retail space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Bayraktar has already experienced some delays. He has spent eight years conducting impact studies and applying for various city permits. To date, the company has made presentations at more than 40 public hearings. There has also been a lawsuit brought by residents of a nearby island challenging the development. The suit was resolved in favor of the city and the developer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of that pushed back the expected completion date by more than a year, to 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the plans were drawn up eight years ago, few people would have predicted the dire state of the economy today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2001, the city of Miami invited developers to submit proposals for developing Watson Island, a well-situated but underused island created in the 1920s during government-sponsored dredging to create a shipping channel for Miami. Aside from a children's museum and a wildlife park called Jungle Island -- and years ago, a base for the Goodyear blimp -- it has been largely undeveloped. Many Floridians' contact with the island has been limited to driving on the MacArthur Causeway that runs through it and connects Miami to South Beach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city was drawn to Flagstone's plans for various public amenities, including a palm tree-lined promenade facing downtown Miami, lush gardens to be created by Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden, a public arts program, and a maritime museum developed in partnership with the Historical Museum of Southern Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">UNDER terms of the deal, Flagstone pays the city $1 million a year in rent during construction, and will pay $2 million a year after completion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Island Gardens project is financed with 35 percent equity, put up by Flagstone and its partner ING Clarion Partners, a real estate investment advisory firm, that signed on in late 2007. Mr. Bayraktar says he has already spent $49 million of his own money. He says he has closed on a loan to cover the marina construction, which he will announce later this spring, and is lining up financing for the retail and hotel components.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It takes ambition, patience and vision to move something forward like this,'' Mr. Bayraktar said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By BOB TEDESCHI   </div><div>708 words</div><div>15 March 2009</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A RECENT report suggests that the housing-market slump is hitting baby boomers particularly hard: many middle-aged homeowners had been so seduced by the rising prices of years past that they failed to save for retirement and may now owe more than their homes are worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, which released the report last month, estimated that 30 percent of homeowners aged 45 to 54 were in this predicament, known as being ''under water.'' (About 15 percent of older baby boomers, 55 to 64, fell into that category as well.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, if these people were forced to sell their homes now, they would have to bring cash to the closing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The center's report also found that baby boomers in the 45-to-54 group saw their overall net worth plummet by about 45 percent over the last five years, to a median level of $94,200 from $172,400.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the drop partly reflected the meltdown of Wall Street, Dean Baker, the co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, said that conservative estimates showed that home equity accounted for about $20,000 of the net income figure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another factor that has led to a decline in personal wealth is what the report calls ''the near zero level of savings nationally'' from 2004 to 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As a result of the bubble-inflated values of their homes, tens of millions of families opted not to save during what would typically be their peak saving years,'' the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The center used 2004 consumer finance data from the Federal Reserve Board that measured a typical consumer's wealth in several categories, including stocks and home equity. Researchers then reduced those values in accordance with the drop in the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index and the median sale price of a house as tracked by the National Association of Realtors. The November S.&amp;P./Case-Shiller 20-city price index was also factored into the projections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Baker said he suspected that fewer baby boomer homeowners were under water in the New York metropolitan region than in other parts of the country, particularly areas where prices have fallen sharply, like Florida, Arizona and Rust Belt states like Michigan and Ohio. But he said that because of the financial industry's persistent woes, owners in the New York area could see more significant declines in home prices this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, many areas in the region are already suffering. According to a report this month by Integrated Asset Services, a Denver-based real estate consulting firm, prices in Fairfield County, Conn., have dropped 42 percent since their peak in 2006, while prices in Passaic County, N.J., have dropped 26 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those homeowners around age 60 whose mortgages are under water, and who might now be considering selling, should carefully weigh their options, said Richard E. Austin, a financial adviser with <span class="companylink">Lincoln Financial Advisors</span> in Rye Brook, N.Y. Selling the house would cost them money, he noted, which could mean that they might need to liquidate other assets -- even retirement savings plans like 401(k)'s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Austin said that if these homeowners expected real estate prices to decline for years, and if they wanted to retire someplace other than their current home, selling now could shield them from deeper losses in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I wouldn't recommend that as the first option, because I'm more of an optimist,'' Mr. Austin said, adding that a better option might be to rent out the house while waiting for home prices to rebound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even baby boomers who aren't under water could have a more difficult time affording retirement. According to the center's report, five years ago, the median baby boomer household, with people aged 45 to 54, had enough net assets to generate about $14,000 in annual interest once the homeowners reached age 65.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, that figure is just under $8,000.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ONE might be excused for thinking that all Manhattan condominium buyers are in a state of panic at the moment, thrashing around for any reason to back out of contracts already signed for apartments in the new glass towers dotting the skyline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After all, co-op sales have dried up, and preliminary figures show that average co-op prices are off 28 percent so far this year from the record prices in the first quarter of 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet last month, despite the faltering economy and a difficult mortgage market, lawyers for 328 buyers of new and existing condos filed deeds with the Department of Finance, the final step in property purchases. And average condo prices are up sharply from those of last summer and fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many buyers stood by commitments, made in better economic times, to buy new apartments in expensive condominiums that are just now being completed. Still, the number of buyers closing on condominiums is falling each month and few buyers are now signing contracts for the latest round of new buildings, endangering many weaker developers. The number of deed filings is off 20 percent from the number of filings in January, off 40 percent from December, and 60 percent from February 2008, when sales were still strong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prices on the new apartments that have actually closed so far in 2009 were so high (including a $30 million glass-walled two-story box built atop a converted industrial building on Hudson Street in SoHo, and a $15 million triplex in a condo conversion at 101st Street and Fifth Avenue) that they drove both the average and median condominium prices to near-record levels, far above the prices in the last half of 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A review of preliminary figures for the first quarter, through last week, put the average condo closing price at $1.82 million, with a median price of $1.195 million. The average price was about 14 percent above that of the second half of 2008, and only 4 percent below the peak average price in the first quarter of 2008, when many apartments were closing at very expensive new developments like 15 Central Park West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the higher average prices, might, perversely, represent some bad news.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dolly Lenz, a top-selling broker at Prudential Douglas Elliman, said major banks had recently cut back on lending in new condominiums, especially those with many unsold units, reducing closings. Wealthy buyers paying cash for more expensive apartments were not affected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The banks, she said, are now requiring that 70 percent of new apartments be sold or in contract before they will issue mortgages, a policy based on new federal guidelines. This requirement is jeopardizing many newer projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The co-op market is faring far worse so far this quarter, as many brokers and analysts had predicted. Prices are down sharply, and deed filings have fallen by more than 60 percent this year compared with the same period in 2008, with the steepest decline in sales among the most expensive units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gregory J. Heym, the chief economist at Halstead and Brown Harris Stevens, said that the decline in co-op prices occurred several months ago, but is appearing only now in property records because co-op closings are often delayed until the buyer is approved by the co-op board. As a result, the average co-op sale price recorded by the Department of Finance fell below $1 million for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2006; it is now just under $930,000, preliminary figures show. The median fell to $598,250, its first time below $600,000 since the same quarter in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average co-op prices were off 18 percent from the second half of 2008, and 28 percent from the record high prices in the first quarter of 2008, according to the preliminary figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kirk Henckels, the director of Stribling Private Brokerage, said that for the last few weeks, the high-end market had been ''picking up momentum,'' with more deals every week. But last week, he said, with more worries about the banks, insurance companies and the auto industry, there appeared to be yet another pause.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That has caused another little intake of air,'' he said. ''Let's hope it doesn't last.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction Appended</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TONY BRANCATELLI, A CLEVELAND CITY COUNCILMAN, yearns for signs that something like normal life still exists in his ward. Early one morning last fall, he called me from his cellphone. He sounded unusually excited. He had just visited two forlorn-looking vacant houses that had been foreclosed more than a year ago. They sat on the same lot, one in front of the other. Both had been frequented by squatters, and Brancatelli had passed by to see if they had been finally boarded up. They hadn't. But while there he noticed with alarm what looked like a prone body in the yard next door. As he moved closer, he realized he was looking at an elderly woman who had just one leg, lying on the ground. She was leaning on one arm and, with the other, was whacking at weeds with a hatchet and stuffing the clippings into a cardboard box for garbage pickup. ''Talk about fortitude,'' he told me. In a place like Cleveland, hope comes in small morsels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next day, I went with Brancatelli to visit Ada Flores, the woman who was whacking at the weeds. She is 81, and mostly gets around in a wheelchair. Flores is a native Spanish speaker, and her English was difficult to understand, especially above the incessant barking of her caged dog, Tuffy. But the story she told Brancatelli was familiar to him. Teenagers had been in and out of the two vacant houses next door, she said, and her son, who visits her regularly, at one point boarded up the windows himself. ''Are they going to tear them down?'' she asked. Brancatelli crossed himself. ''I hope so,'' he mumbled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prayer and sheer persistence are pretty much all Brancatelli has to go on these days. Cleveland is reeling from the foreclosure crisis. There have been roughly 10,000 foreclosures in two years. For all of 2007, before it was overtaken by sky-high foreclosure rates in parts of California, Nevada and Florida, Cleveland's rate was among the highest in the country. (It's now 24th among metropolitan areas.) Vacant houses are not a new phenomenon to the city. Ravaged by the closing of American steel mills, Cleveland has long been in decline. With fewer manufacturing jobs to attract workers, it has lost half its population since 1960. Its poverty rate is one of the highest in the nation. But in all those years, nothing has approached the current scale of ruin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in December, just when local officials thought things couldn't get worse, Cuyahoga County, which includes Cleveland, posted a record number of foreclosure filings. The number of empty houses is so staggeringly high that no one has an accurate count. The city estimates that 10,000 houses, or 1 in 13, are vacant. The county treasurer says it's more likely 15,000. Most of the vacant houses are owned by lenders who foreclosed on the properties and by the wholesalers who are now sweeping in to pick up houses in bulk, as if they were trading in baseball cards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brancatelli and others -- judges, the police, city officials, residents -- are grappling with the wreckage left behind, although to call this the aftermath would be premature. Even with President Barack Obama's plan to help prevent foreclosures, the city is bracing for more, especially as more people lose their jobs. The city's unemployment rate is now 8.8 percent. Moreover, on some streets so many houses are already vacant that those residents left behind are not necessarily inclined to stay. ''It just happens so fast, the sad part is you really have little control,'' Brancatelli told me. ''It snowballs on the street, and you try to prevent that avalanche.'' Walking away from a house even makes a kind of economic sense when the mortgage far exceeds the home's value; Obama's foreclosure-prevention plan does little to address that situation. Now outside investors have descended on Cleveland; they pick up properties for the price of a large flat-screen TV and then try to sell them for a profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So much here defies reasonableness. It's what Brancatelli keeps telling me. A few months ago, he met with Luis Jimenez, a train conductor from Long Beach, Calif. Jimenez had purchased a house in Brancatelli's ward on <span class="companylink">eBay</span> and had come to Cleveland to resolve some issues with the property. The two-story house has a long rap sheet of bad deals. Since 2001, it has been foreclosed twice and sold four times, for prices ranging from $87,000 to $1,500. Jimenez bought it for $4,000. When Jimenez arrived in Cleveland, he learned that the house had been vacant for two years; scavengers had torn apart the walls to get the copper piping, ripped the sinks from the walls and removed the boiler from the basement. He also learned that the city had condemned the house and would now charge him to demolish it. Brancatelli asked Jimenez, What were you thinking, buying a house unseen, from 2,000 miles away? ''It was cheap,'' Jimenez shrugged. He didn't want to walk away from the house, but he didn't have the money to renovate. The property remains an eyesore. ''Generally, I'm an optimist, but none of this makes sense,'' Brancatelli told me. ''Trying to give order to all this chaos is the big challenge.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like others who have stayed in Cleveland, Brancatelli, who has lived in his two-story American Foursquare for 15 years, is trying to hold the wall against the flood. Of his ward, known as Slavic Village, he says: ''It's one of the most resilient communities in the country. People are rolling up their sleeves and working. We can't wait for others to step in.'' This was a tone -- the swagger of the underdog -- that I heard from other Cleveland stalwarts during the weeks I spent in the city this winter. ''Cleveland's a blue-collar community,'' Mayor Frank Jackson told me. ''They're surviving-cultures. And we will fight back.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The task is achingly slow; each house its own battle. On one street I visited, in a ward near Brancatelli's, a third of the houses were abandoned. One resident, Anita Gardner, told me about the young family who moved in down the street a few years before. They spruced up the house with new windows, a fireplace, wood kitchen cabinets, track lighting and a Jacuzzi. When they lost the house to foreclosure, they left nothing for the scavengers. They stripped their own dwelling, piling toilets, metal screen doors, kitchen cabinets, the furnace and copper pipes into a moving van. ''They said, 'Why should someone else get it?' '' Gardner told me. ''So they took it themselves.'' In December, Gardner's neighbor watched a man strain to push a cart filled with thin slabs of concrete down the street. It explained why so many of the abandoned homes in the city are without front steps, as if their legs had been knocked out from under them. Perhaps such pillage is part of the natural momentum of a city being torn apart. If you can't hold onto something of real value, at least get your hands on something.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreclosures are a problem all over the country now, but Cleveland got to this place a while ago. Cities, old and new, are looking at what's occurring in Cleveland with some trepidation -- and also looking for guidance. Already places as diverse as Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Las Vegas and Minneapolis have neighborhoods where at least one of every five homes stands vacant. In states like California, Florida and Nevada, where many of the foreclosures have been newer housing, there is fear that with mounting unemployment and more people walking away from their property, houses will remain empty longer, with a greater likelihood that they will deteriorate or be vandalized. ''There are neighborhoods around the country as bad as anything in Cleveland,'' says Dan Immergluck, a visiting scholar at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and an associate professor in the city and regional planning program at Georgia Tech. Local officials from other industrial cities have visited Cleveland to learn how it's dealing with the devastation. ''Cleveland is a bellwether,'' Immergluck says. ''It's where other cities are heading because of the economic downturn.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TONY BRANCATELLI, WHO IS 51, is a man of a birdlike build and intensity, but he also possesses a Midwestern folksiness, closing most conversations with a cheerful ''alrighty.'' Over the past couple of years, he has become a minor media star. Journalists from Sweden, Japan, China, Germany, Britain and France have visited him, drawn to his ward because of the high rate of foreclosures, at present two a day. Brancatelli's world is defined by the borders of Slavic Village. It's where he grew up and where he has lived for all but three years of his life. His license plate reads Slavic 1. (He tried to convince his wife to get plates that read Slavic 2, but she declined.) The neighborhood took root roughly a hundred years ago: diminutive, narrow homes -- some no more than 900 square feet -- built within walking distance of the steel mills now shuttered. The demographics have been changing over the past decade: African-Americans moving in, whites moving out. A common story. Unintentionally, it's one of the few racially mixed communities in Cleveland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brancatelli's mother worked as a waitress at a local diner, then as a clerk at a neighborhood Army-Navy store. His father was an auto mechanic. They divorced when Brancatelli was 12, yet Brancatelli describes his childhood in Slavic Village in nostalgic hues. ''You always knew somebody,'' he says. ''You didn't need formal day care. There was always somewhere to stay.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He began working for the Slavic Village Development Corporation, a local nonprofit group, in 1988 and a year later became its director. The organization built and renovated storefronts and homes, bringing new people to the area. In fact, he met his wife when she bought a rehabbed house in the neighborhood. He stayed at the development group for 17 years until moving on to the City Council.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cleveland has long been known for its unusually large number of nonprofit housing groups, and in the 1990s their impact on the city was noticeable. Under Brancatelli's watch, Slavic Village Development constructed more than 500 new homes and rehabbed more than 1,000. Brancatelli measured success by the number of homes the group sold for more than $50,000. ''We started to see this incredible transformation,'' he recalls. A local thrift, Third Federal Savings and Loan, built its new corporate headquarters in Slavic Village. Marc A. Stefanski, chairman and chief executive of Third Federal, told me, ''There was a good feeling that, hey, this neighborhood's coming back.'' Throughout the city, there was a renaissance of sorts: new housing construction in the neighborhoods and, downtown, three sports stadiums and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Cleveland adopted the moniker ''The Comeback City.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But then Cleveland was hit hard -- and early -- by the foreclosure crisis. In 1999, Brancatelli noticed something peculiar: homes, many of which were in squalid condition, were selling for inflated prices. One entrepreneur in particular caught Brancatelli's attention: 27-year-old Raymond Delacruz. He would buy a distressed property and, at best, make nominal repairs before quickly selling it for three or four times what he paid for it. The flips needed the cooperation of appraisers and the gullibility of home buyers. But the proliferation of mortgage companies -- mostly based out of state and willing to provide loans with little documentation -- also facilitated flippers. And the flippers justified the high prices to both home buyers and mortgage companies by pointing to the high prices nonprofit housing groups, like Brancatelli's, were getting for their new construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was something else going on in the city that was even more destructive. Unlike fast-growing communities in Florida and California, Cleveland didn't see housing prices rise through the stratosphere. But even moderately rising property values created the conditions for subprime lenders to exploit strapped homeowners. Cold-calling mortgage brokers offered refinancing deals that would let homeowners use the equity in their houses to pay off other debts. A neighbor of Brancatelli's had medical problems and fell behind in her bills. She refinanced, then did it two more times, draining the equity in her house. ''She used her house as an A.T.M.,'' Brancatelli says. ''In the end, they just walked away. The debt exceeded the value of the house.'' In other instances, mortgage brokers would cruise neighborhoods, looking for houses with old windows or a leaning porch, something that needed fixing. They would then offer to arrange financing to pay for repairs. Many of those deals were too good to be true, and interest rates ballooned after a short period of low payments. Suddenly burdened with debt, people began to lose homes they had owned free and clear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As early as 2000, a handful of public officials led by the county treasurer, Jim Rokakis, went to the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and pleaded with it to take some action. In 2002, the city passed an ordinance meant to discourage predatory lending by, among other things, requiring prospective borrowers to get premortgage counseling. In response, the banking industry threatened to stop making loans in the city and then lobbied state legislators to prohibit cities in Ohio from imposing local antipredatory lending laws.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the ensuing years, the city's real estate was transformed into an Alice-in-Wonderland-like landscape. Local officials began keeping track of foreclosed homes by placing red dots on large wall maps. Some corners of the map, like Slavic Village, are now so packed with red dots they look like puddles of blood. The first question outsiders now ask is, Where has everyone gone? The homeless numbers have not increased much over the past couple of years, and it appears that most of the people who lost their homes have moved in with relatives, found a rental or moved out of the city altogether. The county has lost nearly 100,000 people over the past seven years, the largest exodus in recent memory outside of New Orleans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks are now selling properties at such low prices -- many below what they sold for in the 1920s -- you have to wonder why they bother to foreclose at all. (The F.D.I.C. estimates that each foreclosure costs a bank on average $50,000, more than if they were to do a loan modification.) All of this leaves Brancatelli in a constant state of exasperation. When asked how he's doing, he often takes a breath and replies, ''Another day in paradise.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">O.V.V. IS A TERM OF ART that stands for Open, Vacant and Vandalized. Houses fitting this description have popped up like prairie dogs. They are boarded, unboarded, then boarded again, and the city can't keep up with the savvy squatters. They will prop the plywood over the front entrance to make it look as if it's nailed shut. One woman told me that she called the police last summer when she saw smoke coming out of a vacant home across the street; it turned out that some young men were cooking on a grill inside.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a dreary wintry day, Brancatelli took me to Hosmer Street, on which a fourth of the homes were foreclosed. As we strolled down the block, Brancatelli noticed something odd. Through a side window of one slender house, we could make out a waist-high pile of tree limbs and branches. The front door was off the hinges and propped against the entrance. We entered through the rear, where the door was gone altogether. ''Hello,'' Brancatelli hollered, ''City!'' -- an effort to both warn squatters and frighten animals. Earlier that day we entered another O.V.V. and heard footsteps upstairs. ''They don't have a gun,'' he had assured me. He explained that scavengers know enough not to carry weapons because it would mean more prison time should they be caught. Even in O.V.V.'s, there are rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inside, we found firewood and brush piled in the kitchen and front room. ''The crap we deal with,'' Brancatelli muttered to himself. He snapped a photo with his cellphone and sent an e-mail message to the city's Building and Housing Department, urging the department to send someone to secure the house. He often does this two or three times a day. But finding a collection of timber like this is of particular concern; over the past year there have been more than 60 fires in his ward, all in vacant houses. The fire department tried stakeouts but has not caught anyone. The general belief is that the fires are set either by squatters trying to stay warm or by mischievous kids. Brancatelli, though, wonders aloud if it might be vigilantes who don't like the blight on their block. ''Maybe I'm overthinking it,'' he says. More likely, he's projecting. He would like to see many of these houses just disappear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is Brancatelli's conundrum: many of the abandoned homes should be razed. They're either so old or so impractically tiny that they have little resale value, or they have been stripped of their innards and are in utter disrepair. There are an estimated one million lender-owned properties nationwide, and on average each house sits empty for eight months, a length of time that is only growing. Demolition, though, is costly: roughly $8,000 a house. Two years ago, <span class="companylink">Litton Loan Servicing</span>, a mortgage servicer, discussed giving the city a number of foreclosed homes. Free. The city told them that would be fine, but only if the company came up with money to pay for the necessary demolitions. The transaction never occurred.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last summer, Congress appropriated $3.9 billion in emergency funds for cities to acquire and rehab foreclosed properties. (An additional $2 billion will be available under the recently enacted economic-stimulus package.) The legislation was labeled the Neighborhood Stabilization Program, but Cleveland and a handful of other cities had to lobby hard to convince Congress that ''stabilization'' in their cities meant tearing down houses -- not renovating them. Last month, Cleveland said it planned to use more than half of its $25.5 million allotment to raze 1,700 houses. This presents an opportunity to reimagine the city, to erase the obsolete and provide a space for the new. (There's little money now to build, so imagine is the operative word.) Cuyahoga County is also establishing a land bank, a public entity that can acquire distressed properties and hold on to the land until improved economic times allow for redevelopment. The county hopes to persuade banks to unload their distressed properties, which the land bank would then raze, as well as give up some foreclosed properties in the suburbs, which the county could eventually renovate and sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other cities -- including Minneapolis, Youngstown, Detroit and Cincinnati -- have put aside at least a third of their neighborhood-stabilization funds for demolition. ''As properties stay vacant for longer periods of time,'' says Joe Schilling, a founder of the National Vacant Properties Campaign, ''it's inevitable that even in some of the fast-growing communities, they'll have to look at demolition.'' Phoenix, for instance, has set aside a quarter of its grant money to tear down abandoned homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cleveland may use some of those demolition dollars on houses now owned by the federal government. Between the Department of Housing and Urban Development and entities like <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, the federal government has control of roughly a thousand abandoned properties in Cleveland. Across the street from the house with the timber inside sits a one-and-a-half story vacant property owned by HUD, which had guaranteed the last mortgage. On the front porch, a large picture window was wide open, but Brancatelli chose to enter through the front door. Going on a hunch, he punched the numbers in the address into the lockbox. The toilet was gone, as was the copper piping. HUD recently sold this house -- for $1,500 -- but didn't inform the new owner that the house had been condemned. ''They dumped the house,'' Brancatelli grumbled. ''It's this kind of stuff that drives me nuts.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few weeks ago Brancatelli persuaded HUD to let the owner out of his purchase. Then HUD offered to sell the city its distressed properties, including this one, for $100 each. You might think this was something to celebrate. Brancatelli, though, is irked. As he sees it, the city will now have to use some of its emergency HUD financing to demolish houses that HUD was responsible for.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE LIFE OF A CLEVELAND CITY COUNCILMAN has become one of answering complaints derived in one way or another from the foreclosure crisis. In November, Zachary Reed, who represents the ward near Slavic Village, received a pleading phone call from Cecilia Cooper-Hardy, a constituent and school-bus driver who lives next to a vacant house. Cooper-Hardy told Reed that as she was leaving for work at 5 one morning, she peered out her living-room window and noticed a pair of eyes staring back at her from behind a slit cut in a window shade next door. Reed had the house secured, but within days the boards were pulled off. Cooper-Hardy then purchased a pistol that she now keeps under her pillow. The local police commander calls her regularly, just to make sure everything's O.K., a routine he has adopted with others as well. Last summer, while Cooper-Hardy was doing yardwork, someone slipped in her back door. She hollered to a neighbor across the street who was drinking in the yard with friends. They rushed to her aid as the burglar fled. That neighbor is gone now. Another foreclosure. So every morning she offers up a prayer, and then she peeks out her living room blinds to see if there's anyone peeking back at her from the house next door. Reed, the councilman, told me, ''If we don't get some help we're going to turn into a third-world nation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brancatelli doesn't necessarily disagree with the sentiment, but he continues to search for reasons to be sanguine. He insisted on driving me past a small store called Johnny's Beverage because, he told me, it was a key to his community's future. Johnny's Beverage sits in the middle of a residential block. Its facade is worn. Dark plastic sheeting covers the front windows so you can't see in. A hodgepodge of posters and handwritten signs advertise cold beer and wine, cigarettes and lottery tickets. A tattered American flag flaps in the breeze. When Jerome Jackson purchased the store three years ago, Brancatelli told him in no uncertain terms that he wasn't too happy about it and that he was going to oppose the transfer of the liquor license. It did not, after all, have the aspect of a family-friendly enterprise you would want in a residential neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jackson, who is 52 and barrel-chested, has a retiring demeanor. His perch is a narrow space separated from the rest of the store by counter-to-ceiling plexiglass. He had managed a store in another neighborhood and saved up to buy his own business. He renovated the upstairs and moved in (and hung the American flag from a second-floor deck he built).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He then purchased a foreclosed house down the street, where his brother could live. The house next door to the store went into foreclosure, and Brancatelli heard that Jackson kept watch over it, chasing scavengers away and erecting a fence in the rear. He also heard that Jackson had alerted the city that there was a foot of water in the basement of the vacant, the result of pipes having been ripped out. (This is common; Brancatelli has seen back water bills for vacant houses as high as $6,000.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brancatelli began to reconsider his opinion of Jackson. He was keeping an eye on the neighborhood -- and he was committed to staying. Brancatelli decided to support the liquor-license transfer and then told Jackson that he would help get him the property next door, if he agreed to tear it down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. Bank, which owned the house, appealed a city condemnation order. ''It's the running joke,'' Brancatelli told me. ''The banks appeal the condemnations because they say they want more time to make repairs to put it on the market to sell. And I go to the hearings on a regular basis to say you shouldn't get more time. Here, they owned it for more than six months and hadn't made any repairs. They just want time to try to unload the property.'' Jackson offered U.S. Bank $2,000. He heard nothing. He upped his offer to $3,000. Again, no response. When Brancatelli intervened and made it clear that U.S. Bank would be stuck with the $8,000 demolition bill, the bank agreed to sell it for a dollar to the Slavic Development Corporation. The nonprofit group then turned it over to Jackson, who agreed to pay for the razing. ''Imbeciles,'' Brancatelli said more than once, referring to the banks. ''They're imbeciles.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I spent an evening with Jackson in his store and watched as a young disheveled man came in and purchased a pack of cigarettes. He hovered around the plexiglass. ''Do you want to buy some tools?'' the man asked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''No,'' Jackson curtly replied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Customers frequently offer Jackson sinks, cabinets and other scavenged items. He says that in the few years he has owned the store, the community has become more transient. ''I don't know nobody no more,'' he said. ''I don't know who to trust.'' Everyone calls him Johnny. They assume the store was named after him, even though it has been there for decades. The week before Christmas, two men rammed a van into the front of the store, intending to rob it. The van got stuck, and the robbers fled. But Jackson isn't deterred. He says he hopes one day to knock down his store and build a row of small enterprises, including a restaurant and a barbershop. He is trying to buy another vacant house on the block. Brancatelli now fears he'll lose Jackson. ''I want to convince him we have a strategy for the neighborhood,'' he told me. ''The worst thing you can have happen is to have this store close up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BY MID-2007, IT BECAME CLEAR to Brancatelli that his was a city at the mercy of lenders and real estate wholesalers, who now owned thousands of abandoned properties in the city. Somehow, the city needed to hold these new land barons accountable for their vacant houses, so many of which were in utter disrepair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brancatelli and others looked to Raymond Pianka, the judge in the city's lone housing court. In 1996, Pianka gave up his seat on the City Council to accept this judgeship. His judicial colleagues derisively refer to it as ''rat court,'' because its main function is to make sure that owners mow their lawns, trim their hedges, clean up their garbage, repair leaning porches or hanging gutters -- in short, that they make their homes inhospitable for rats. No one foresaw that this lowliest of courts would become one of the most powerful instruments in the city's fight for survival. ''The court's the only tool we have,'' Brancatelli said. ''When we get them into court, we can't let them go.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2001, when it became clear how Raymond Delacruz was wreaking havoc on city neighborhoods by flipping houses, it was Pianka who ran him out of town. The city's building and housing department cited Delacruz for code violations on a house he hadn't flipped fast enough. When he didn't show up in court, Pianka had his chief bailiff stake out Delacruz at a doughnut shop. Pianka placed him on house arrest, ordering him to spend 30 days in the dilapidated structure he owned but had not maintained. Shortly after his sentence was up, Delacruz moved to Columbus, where he continued his flipping, and was eventually convicted for fraud that included swindling a bank vice president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing codes, which were established in the mid-19th century, set minimum standards for housing quality. They traditionally help maintain both a city's aesthetics and safety. In Cleveland today, they seem to be all that keeps the city from crumbling. In 2007, Pianka realized that the banks weren't showing up in court after being cited for code violations. ''They were thumbing their noses at the city,'' he told me. ''They were probably thinking, It's Municipal Court. What can they do? And we thought, How loud can this mouse roar?'' Pianka set up what he called his Clean Hands Docket. If a bank didn't respond to a warrant, Pianka refused to order any evictions it requested.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pianka's staff also dug up a little-used 1953 statute that allowed for trials in absentia, and every other Monday afternoon for the last year and a half Pianka has held trials with a judge and a prosecutor but no defendant. The first case involved Destiny Ventures, a firm based in Oklahoma that buys foreclosed properties in bulk and then sells them. It was cited in 2007 for violations on one of its houses, but didn't show up in court. The idea of a trial without a defendant was so unusual that when the prosecutor said he had no opening statement, Pianka prodded him. ''You're going to waive opening statement?'' he asked. ''Don't you want to give the court a little road map about the strategy?'' A housing inspector testified that Destiny Ventures had done nothing to correct the code violations on the vacant two-story clapboard house in question. The windows were punched out, the front door was wide open and roof shingles were missing. Pianka fined Destiny Ventures $40,000, and then had a collection agency sweep the company's bank accounts for the money. Brancatelli celebrated by taping a copy of the check to his office wall. In a recent phone interview, an owner of Destiny Ventures, Steve Nodine, said, ''It's unconstitutional the way they fine people.'' His firm now refuses to do business in Cleveland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One morning this fall, I visited Pianka before his Monday court session. His office, on the 13th floor of the Justice Center, overlooks Lake Erie and the new Cleveland Browns Stadium. It might be one of the nicer views in the city, but he would just as soon overlook the city's residential neighborhoods. When I entered his chambers, he was on his computer scanning Web sites to tap into the real estate chatter. He found a Cleveland house on <span class="companylink">eBay</span> selling for $500. In the photos, Pianka could make out mold on the walls and noticed a large portable heater, which he said was illegal. He shook his head. He has no power to haul people into court. Building and housing inspectors issue citations for code violations, and then the city's law department decides whether to prosecute. Pianka hears only misdemeanor offenses, but he can both fine and jail defendants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pianka, who has a bushy mustache, often seems amused, so it's easy to underestimate his resoluteness. The chief magistrate told me she has heard Pianka curse only once. It was in late 2007. He had fined <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> $20,000 for code violations but told the bank he would rescind the fine if it spent that amount rehabilitating the structure. <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> fixed up the house, and it was, for Pianka, a success story. When he drove the chief magistrate to the address to show off the house, there was nothing there, just a vacant lot. The city, he discovered, had razed it, unaware of the repairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pianka lives on a beautiful block in Cleveland's Detroit-Shoreway neighborhood, where there is a stunning variety of architecture. But even on his street, there have been three foreclosures. For months, Pianka helped keep watch on a majestic 19th-century Victorian down the street. One neighbor paid for the electricity so the vacant house would be protected against vandals by an alarm system. Pianka shoveled the snow in winter and often parked his car in the driveway so it would appear as if someone were living there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pianka is an amateur historian, and his office shelves are filled with books on Poland, his grandfather's native country. During my visit, he retrieved a book about wartime Warsaw and opened it to a photograph of a lone man with a wheelbarrow collecting bricks from the rubble of a building's ruins. ''He's putting the city back together,'' Pianka told me. ''We just have to make the best of things. We have to do it because nobody else will.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of his assistants poked her head in the doorway. ''It looks like we're going to have another packed house,'' she announced, and Pianka headed for the courtroom. A line of people snaked into the hallway. When the bailiff called their names, they approached the lectern, usually without an attorney. Pianka asked one man how he wanted to plead. ''I plead whatever it takes,'' he replied. Most of the defendants are simply asking for guidance, or at least some understanding, and the word is that you can trust Pianka. ''He's the most loved judge in Cleveland,'' Brancatelli told me. A good number of the defendants are facing foreclosure themselves and don't have the means to keep up their property. Until recently, many might have refinanced, but that is no longer an option.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the first cases I observed involved Sally Hardy, who is 52 and works as a housekeeper at a nursing home. She asked Pianka if she could confer briefly with the prosecutor, which she did, and then began to cry softly. ''What'd you say to her?'' Pianka asked the prosecutor in an attempt to lighten the mood. Hardy jogged out of the courtroom in tears. When she returned, Pianka apologized. ''I'm sorry,'' he said. ''These are emotional times, and sometimes it feels like the weight of the world is on your shoulders.'' Her house was in foreclosure, she told Pianka, but she had rescued it. Pianka brightened. ''That's a great accomplishment,'' he told her. He ordered her into a program that assists struggling homeowners; a housing specialist will work with Hardy to find money to repair her roof and porch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mayra Caraballo, a 39-year-old mother of two, appeared in court in response to code violations on her home. She explained to Pianka that she no longer owned the house. She had lost her job at a processing plant, and an adjustable rate had kicked in on her mortgage, boosting her monthly payments to $1,100, from $800. She had left after receiving a foreclosure notice. The house was quickly stripped of everything but the furnace. Pianka asked a clerk to check into the house's ownership; he suspected that the lender had withdrawn the foreclosure at the last minute, as is becoming more common. The clerk tracked down the trustee on the mortgage, <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>, and confirmed that the foreclosure had indeed been withdrawn. Pianka calls these situations ''toxic titles.'' ''You're in limbo,'' Pianka told a shocked Caraballo. ''There's no hope in your getting out of this property as a result of foreclosure. We're seeing this more and more.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pianka sees these toxic titles as an effort by lenders to dodge responsibility for vacant houses. Later, I called <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> to ask about Caraballo's house. ''We don't own the property,'' a spokesman told me. ''We're the owner of record, but the investors who bought the mortgage-backed securities own it.'' Pianka chuckled when I told him of the bank's response. ''That's their mantra: we don't own it,'' he said. ''It's handy for them to say, 'Oh, it's not us.' It's part of this big shell game they're playing.'' I checked in with Caraballo, too. She's now renting and working part time at a day care center. She told me that she would like to move back into the house, but she's not sure she has the money to replace all the hardware that has been stripped by scavengers or to make the necessary repairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the last year and a half, the housing court has collected $1.6 million in fines from defendants who didn't show up for their trials. Last April, Pianka fined <span class="companylink">Washington Mutual</span> $100,000 for a vacant property on the city's west side. <span class="companylink">Washington Mutual</span>, now owned by <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span>, appealed, and in December, the Eighth District Court of Appeals in Ohio ruled that trials in absentia were not permitted in misdemeanor cases, essentially putting an end to Pianka's efforts. <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span> disputes the code violations, but a spokeswoman said the bank was not planning to send a representative to court to respond to the city's charges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We just have to figure out some other ways,'' Pianka told me. He has suggested that the city could name corporate officers when prosecuting code violations. He told me that a Cleveland police officer was so angered by all the abandoned properties that he volunteered last month to serve warrants to bank officers should they ever be issued. In the meantime, early last year, Cleveland sued 21 lenders, arguing that their vacant houses created a public nuisance, virtually destroying some neighborhoods. Ten of those lenders have since gone under, been acquired or gone into bankruptcy. The case is slowly winding its way through federal court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This crisis changes weekly,'' Pianka told me. ''It's a torrent of water coming at us. We can divert it one way or another. But we can't stop it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ON FEB. 29 LAST YEAR, Derek Owens, a 36-year-old police officer on patrol, spotted a group of young men drinking beer in the open garage of an abandoned house. Neighbors previously complained of teenagers both selling and using drugs in the row of vacant houses on the street. When Owens and his partner got out of their squad car, the men fled. As Owens chased them, one of the men stopped in the driveway of yet another abandoned house, turned around and opened fire. One shot hit Owens in the abdomen, and he died several hours later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Brancatelli heard of Owens's murder, he wondered who owned the abandoned house and garage where the young men were drinking. He made some phone calls and discovered that he knew the owners, Eric and Sheila Tomasi, a couple from Templeton, Calif., who had been buying up foreclosed houses in Cleveland as an investment. Eric Tomasi soon called. He had heard about the shooting. Brancatelli liked the Tomasis, and suggested that it might be a good idea to begin repairs on the house. The neighbors, he told Tomasi, were up in arms over the vacant houses in their community. The Tomasis soon sought permits to do work and began to fix up the house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brancatelli had met the Tomasis a few weeks earlier at a suburban hotel where a private company was auctioning off foreclosed homes. Brancatelli was there to scare off speculators. He passed out a flyer, which read in part: ''Dealing with the increasing problem of abandoned and vacant homes is at the forefront of our efforts to continue improving our community. . . . You should be aware that some of these homes were the source of incredible community concern and some resulted in criminal prosecution of mortgage brokers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is what Brancatelli calls ''the next tsunami'' -- companies and individuals who are buying foreclosed houses in bulk and then quickly selling them for a profit, often without making any repairs. The companies have appellations like Whatever Inc., Under Par Properties and Tin Cup Investments. Brancatelli thought all the equity had been wrung out of these properties, but clearly he was mistaken.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At this auction, Brancatelli was introduced to the Tomasis. They are both in their 40s. Before investing in real estate, Sheila Tomasi owned a small chain of clothing stores and Eric Tomasi was a mortgage broker and before that managed a chain of sporting-goods stores. Brancatelli found them surprisingly open, unlike some of the other wholesalers -- or ''bottom feeders'' as some derisively refer to them -- who wouldn't return his phone calls or e-mail queries. He invited the couple to a gathering of local housing activists, and they laidout their business plan. Brancatelli was curious to find out how anyone was making money in a market where houses were selling for a few thousand dollars on <span class="companylink">eBay</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Tomasis said that they owned about 200 houses in Cleveland. (They purchased 2,000 homes last year, in 22 states.) They explained that they, unlike most other wholesalers, provide each buyer with the mechanicals -- pipes, a boiler, a furnace, all the basic materials that had been stripped -- that the purchaser would then be responsible for installing. Brancatelli derived some comfort from this description. From his background with a nonprofit housing group, he knew the theory that people who put sweat equity into a house will be more committed to its upkeep and to making the mortgage payments. The financing the Tomasis laid out, though, made Brancatelli squirm. The purchaser would pay $500 down and then make monthly payments of no more than $450, which was below local rental prices. But the interest rate was 10 or 11 percent. What most concerned Brancatelli was that the Tomasis eventually hope to package the mortgages and sell them to investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's Groundhog Day all over again,'' Brancatelli remembers thinking to himself. ''Intuitively, it doesn't make any sense that a person from California would be buying hundreds of distressed properties in a place that's in a downward spiral. It has nothing but the makings of someone coming to pillage our neighborhood.'' But did that mean he shouldn't work with the Tomasis? If he considered them the enemy, he wondered, where would that get him? Eric Tomasi assured Brancatelli and the others that they had a shared interest. ''I want to put people in homes,'' he said. ''And you want to get homes occupied.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pianka says Brancatelli faces a difficult choice: work with the Tomasis to make sure their properties are maintained and then sold to people who make the payments, or contest the Tomasis' efforts and lose any oversight. In December, while I was driving through Slavic Village with Brancatelli, we passed a Tomasi-owned house that wasn't secured. He left a message for Tomasi: ''Eric, calling about 6921 Gertrude. The door's open in the back. Give me a call. Hope things are well.'' Tomasi sent someone out to board it up. ''Even if I didn't like this guy, I don't have the ammo to fight him,'' Brancatelli later told me. ''Let's see if this is a model we can work with.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THERE ARE REASONS to be wary. During my time in Cleveland, I came across two properties owned by an investment company that goes by the name Thor Real Estate. The first I stumbled across while driving through the city's west side with Jay Westbrook, a city councilman. We passed a compact two-story house that had been vacant just a few weeks earlier. Westbrook peeked through the windows and, much to his surprise, saw some activity. A young, stocky man was inside installing new floors. He introduced himself as Oswan Jackson and told us he had just bought the house. He planned to move in with his wife, who was pregnant with their first child. He seemed disoriented, like many new homeowners, overwhelmed by the amount of work he needed to do. ''I didn't know there were code violations,'' he told Westbrook. The foundation was failing and the roof needed replacing. He said the purchase price was $24,580 for the house: $500 down and $290 a month. ''We'll make it work for you,'' Westbrook cheerfully told him. ''Welcome to the neighborhood.'' A few days later, after a colleague researched the property, Westbrook learned that the house had been in such poor condition that it was condemned three weeks after Jackson signed the contract -- and that Jackson owed the back taxes on the property, which amounted to $4,000. The last I spoke with Jackson, he planned to walk away from his new home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second house was on East 113th Street. The front steps were missing; piles of brush and rubbish clogged the driveway. One side was tagged by a local gang, an indication that it had been used as a gathering place. Posted to the front porch was a sign that read: 500 Down, 295 a month. In January on <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span>, the owner advertised it this way: ''I have a beautiful home at 3637 East 113th Street, Cleveland, OH 44105 Move in now! No credit check!'' One neighbor I spoke to wondered why anyone would want to buy it. ''It looks like there's nothing left for that house to give,'' the neighbor said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dispiriting part of the story behind these houses, certainly from Brancatelli's point of view, is that Thor Real Estate had been in partnership with the Tomasis. The Tomasis say they are now separate entities, but in court, the Tomasis have admitted that properties have been transferred between the two companies, and on occasion Eric Tomasi has offered to speak for Thor on code-violation cases. Once again, it's hard to know who owns what.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, Sheila Tomasi appeared in housing court. Sheila Tomasi is a personable, cheerful woman with high cheekbones and honey-streaked hair. The Tomasis purchased a house for their own use near Cleveland, and she was back for a couple of weeks to appear in court and to check on their properties. It wasn't the Tomasis' first time in Pianka's court, and on that day, five of the Tomasis' properties were cited for code violations. During her appearance, she told the court about a new owner, a single mother of seven, who had hired a contractor to install new pipes provided by the Tomasis. But it was a shoddy job. So, the Tomasis hired a plumber themselves and paid him $1,300 to redo the work. They added that charge to the woman's monthly mortgage payments. ''I can't go to sleep at night if we can't give someone a good start,'' Tomasi told me on an earlier occasion. ''You want to groom them and get all the hiccups out of owning a home: that they're getting all their improvements done, that they're paying their taxes. We want to make sure that everything's going O.K.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tomasi also confirmed to the judge that they were considering the purchase of another 1,000 homes in the city. ''That's the nature of what's happening here,'' Pianka sighed. ''We feel in many ways helpless.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You've moved to Cleveland at least temporarily,'' he said. ''That's important, and taking care of your inventory properties, making sure you come into compliance with the law. There aren't enough inspectors to follow you around.'' Tomasi nodded. Pianka continued, ''If we find out you have a property and it's flying below the radar, there are going to be severe consequences.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Yes, your honor,'' Tomasi replied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, as if thinking aloud, Pianka said, ''It is really tough being a city municipality because we're subject to international banks, national banks, acts of Congress, buyouts of mortgages. . . . We have no control over those entities, so I guess we're going to have to try to work with you.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He fined the Tomasis $50,000 but gave them time to either raze the properties or repair them. ''I'd like you to appreciate what we're dealing with in Cleveland,'' he told Tomasi. ''Now if you don't have some good reason, I expect a good check made out to the clerk.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pianka left the bench shaking his head and later told me he better understood why Brancatelli was willing to work with the Tomasis. ''What are you to do?'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When I told Brancatelli about the court proceedings and about the Tomasis' mention of purchasing another 1,000 homes, Brancatelli said, ''It's just really strange times.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: March 08, 2009</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cover article on Page 28 this weekend about efforts by Cleveland and other cities to deal with the growing number of foreclosures misstates the name of an area in Louisiana with a recent exodus of people comparable to that of Cleveland.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ''For Sale'' signs are just starting to sprout, but already experts worry that this spring home-buying season will be even grimmer than the last.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite tentative signs of recovery in hard-hit areas like California and Florida, the broader housing market is far from reaching bottom, economists say. Across much of the nation, prices are likely to keep falling into 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So this March-to-June season, when most homes are bought and sold, will be bad, perhaps the worst since the market began to spiral down in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the nation, 19 million houses and apartments -- nearly one out of every seven -- are vacant, the highest percentage since the 1960s. But only about six million of those homes are for sale or for rent. That means millions more could still flood onto the market, depressing prices further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For would-be sellers, the bad news keeps coming. This week, one new report showed that one in nine mortgages was delinquent or in foreclosure, while another showed that January contract signings for sales of previously owned homes fell at their fastest pace in two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, the Obama administration announced details of a plan that will pay banks to lower monthly payments for troubled borrowers, hoping to avert millions of foreclosures and keep more homes occupied. Despite that effort, most analysts expect the outlook to worsen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as the recession deepens, the downturn in housing, where the economic crisis began, is starting to play out in new, unexpected ways. Cities where home values held up last year are suffering now, while some suburban areas where prices plunged are slowly starting to improve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In inland areas of California, for instance, sales are surging now that prices have fallen sharply. But most of the sellers are not individuals but rather banks that foreclosed on homeowners who could not or would not pay their mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, in cities like New York and San Francisco, where prices have not fallen as much, the market is largely frozen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The further you get from the city, the more prices have declined, and that's where we see sales increasing,'' said Glenn Kelman, chief executive of Redfin, a real estate brokerage firm. ''Eighteen months ago, the city was the only place where people were still buying homes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christian Punsal, a 24-year-old city employee in Elk Grove, Calif., near Sacramento, is among the first-time homeowners and investors swooping in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Punsal bought a three-bedroom home for $193,000. On a monthly basis, the house will cost him $100 less than the rent on his two-bedroom apartment. The home sold for $336,000 four years ago, when he was a junior in college.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I just felt that this would be the perfect time to buy,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others like him are wading into the California market. In January, home sales in the state jumped by 54 percent from January 2008. But about 60 percent of the previously owned homes sold had recently been in foreclosure, according to <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span>, a publisher of real estate information.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carlos Kozlowski, a real estate agent with Coldwell Banker in Sacramento, said virtually every home he sold recently, including the one Mr. Punsal bought, was owned by the bank or a ''short sale,'' in which the price was less than the property's mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices are down as much as 50 percent from a few years ago, and many properties are getting multiple bids, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, home sales fell nationally in January, reflecting a sharp drop in the Northeast, which, with parts of the Northwest and South, has lagged the real estate downturn in the Southwest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Manhattan, for instance, sales of condominiums and co-operative apartments fell 52 percent in January, according to Miller Samuel, an appraisal firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market has been hammered by layoffs on Wall Street, tighter lending standards and a glut of new buildings, said Jonathan J. Miller, chief executive of the firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The leverage is being squeezed out of the economy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York is not alone. Real estate sales have also slumped in cities like San Francisco and Seattle, which previously seemed impervious. California's recent experience might offer one roadmap of how the housing slump will play out in other places. But the process will be painful and slow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So April, when buying traditionally picks up, could be the cruelest month yet for the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You are really looking at a very, very ugly outlook,'' said Ivy Zelman, chief executive of Zelman &amp; Associates, a housing research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent months, many banks and mortgage companies have suspended foreclosures voluntarily or because of state moratoriums meant to encourage negotiations between delinquent borrowers and lenders. Experience, however, shows that these suspensions merely delay foreclosures, and that foreclosed homes soon flood the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another big concern is that homeowners with solid credit records will fall behind on their mortgages in greater numbers as unemployment rises.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So for now, the American dream of homeownership is a dream deferred for many people. Growth in the number of households -- defined as families or unrelated people living together -- slowed last year, to 1.1 million, from an average of 1.4 million a year from 2000 to 2006, according to George Masnick, a researcher at the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University. Economists say the growth rate will likely fall further in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the vacant homes are concentrated in far-flung suburbs in the Southwest and in Florida, which means that prices there may not return to their highs for many years. It also suggests that much of the country does not have as large an oversupply of homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for now even areas that did not see a boom in construction and home prices in recent years are suffering. Brad Hunter, chief economist at Metrostudy, a housing research firm, cited North Carolina as an example. From 2000 to 2006, home prices in Charlotte climbed only an average of 3.7 percent a year; but last year prices fell 7.2 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of his colleagues who works in the state told Mr. Hunter, ''We got the hangover but we never had the party.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Troubled housing markets do not rebound quickly. The first thing to turn up are sales of homes as banks and individuals acknowledge that prices are no longer what they were; some of that is already happening in California and Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices tend to lag sales by a couple of years. That is what happened in Massachusetts and California in the early 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How long will the current slump last?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A futures market for home prices provides one sobering forecast. Trading in contracts that track home prices in 25 metropolitan areas suggests that home prices will fall about 15 percent this year and hit bottom in 2010, according to Radar Logic, a firm that created the index on which the trading is based. The market is also predicting that the Los Angeles area is closer to the bottom than New York.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOUSES in the United States are now more affordable than at any time in the last 40 years, when compared with personal income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only a couple of years ago, home prices rose to clearly unsustainable multiples of income, and the abrupt change could hold out hope for a revival of the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the summer of 2005, when funny-money mortgages were readily available and helping to drive up home prices, the national median sales price of a home was almost eight times as much as the average per capita after-tax income of Americans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But by this January, with incomes up and home prices down sharply, that multiple had fallen to less than five.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That may be little comfort for many homeowners who owe more than their homes are now worth, but it does indicate that home prices have fallen far enough, at least in many areas, to make them affordable.''You have a big debt overhang problem, but you don't have a house price problem anymore,'' said Robert J. Barbera, the chief economist of ITG, an advisory firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices vary widely from region to region, and people in areas like New York or Los Angeles can only dream of finding an acceptable home for $169,900, which the National Association of Realtors says was the median sales price of previously owned homes sold in January. That figure was down from a peak of $230,900 in July 2006. It is not clear that prices have declined enough to make houses broadly affordable in some regions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">National median prices can be misleading, particularly because more or fewer sales may be coming from high-cost or low-cost areas. Moreover, the volume of home sales has plunged. Many recent sales involved homes that were in or close to foreclosure, and may have been conducted at prices lower than the asking price for other homes in the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it is also possible that the decline in the median price may understate the devastation that has befallen the housing market in some areas. In December, the latest figure available, the S.&amp; P./Case-Shiller composite home price index for the 20 regions was off 27 percent from July 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The personal income figures may also be high, since they are affected by government transfer payments and include significant increases in Medicaid and unemployment insurance payments. But the trend is the same even with transfer payments eliminated from the calculation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pressures are still forcing home prices down, including the difficulty of obtaining mortgages for prospective buyers who cannot meet the standards set by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, the government-controlled agencies that finance the bulk of new home loans now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, there was a lot of overbuilding in many areas, and even though construction has plunged, the inventory of unsold homes has stayed stubbornly high. Rising unemployment levels may discourage some who could buy from doing so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But at least by one measure, home prices no longer appear to be high by historic standards. That fact could help to stimulate demand, if not immediately, then at least when the economy appears to stabilize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CHART: MEDIAN HOUSE PRICE AS A MULTIPLE OF PER CAPITA DISPOSABLE INCOME: The median price of existing homes has fallen 26 percent since it peaked in July 2006, while disposable income has risen 9 percent. As a result, houses cost less relative to incomes than at any time since the data became available in 1968.(Sources: Bureau of Economic Analysis and National Association of Realtors, via <span class="companylink">Haver Analytics</span>)</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The number of people who agreed to buy a previously owned home sank to a new low in January as economic woes turned them away from the housing market, the National Association of Realtors said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group's seasonally adjusted index of pending sales contracts fell 7.7 percent, to 80.4, in January, from a downwardly revised December reading of 87.1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The January index was worse than the 85.1 economists had expected, according to Thomson Reuters, and was below the previous record low of 82.5 in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It really does all come back to the job market,'' said Mike Larson, a real estate analyst with Weiss Research, in a research note. ''The latest evidence suggests we're seeing little relief on that front. Jobless claims are rising sharply and layoff announcements are coming fast and furious.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index, which started in 2001, tracks signed contracts to buy previously owned homes. Typically there is a one- to two-month lag between a contract and a completed deal, so the index is a barometer for future sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending sales were down in every region but the West, where soaring foreclosures have made prices attractive for buyers. The index there was up more than 2 percent from December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending sales were down about 13 percent in the Northeast, 12 percent in the South and 9 percent in the Midwest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many in the real estate industry are counting on an $8,000 tax credit for first-time buyers as their best hope for improving sales. That incentive was in the economic stimulus package President Obama signed last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Even with many serious potential home buyers on the sidelines waiting for passage of the stimulus bill, job losses and weak consumer confidence were a natural drag on home sales,'' Lawrence Yun, the Realtors' chief economist, said in a statement.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article on March 1 about the art collectors Jose Mugrabi and his sons, Alberto and David, referred imprecisely to a sculpture of theirs that was at the Guggenheim. It was exhibited by the museum as a ''promised gift,'' but when the Mugrabis chose not to donate it, the museum returned it to them. It was not bought back by the Mugrabis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHOTOGRAPHS BY REUBEN COX FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Sun Mar 22 2009 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, Sept. 15, mere hours after <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> declared bankruptcy in New York City, <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> was throwing open the doors of its London headquarters for the most extravagant sale in the auction house's history. The sale, of 223 new artworks by Damien Hirst, brought in more than $200 million -- nearly 10 times the total receipts of the previous record-holder for a single artist, a 1993 auction of 88 Picassos that reaped around $20 million. It was a level of consumption that, particularly when viewed against the concurrent collapse of the financial-services industry, almost immediately acquired a nostalgic air, the last gasp of the art boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the audience sat the men of the Mugrabi family -- the patriarch Jose and his sons, Alberto and David -- New York art dealers for whom the evening was not so much a transitional moment as simply another high-stakes day at the office. The Mugrabis own what is believed to be one of the largest and most valuable private collections of art in the world. By their estimate, it includes more than 3,000 works. They have built the collection over the past 25 years, since Jose, an Israeli-born fabric merchant who raised the family in Colombia, moved his wife, Mary, and their two sons to America and got into the art business full time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The core of their collection is a staggering 800 works by Andy Warhol -- ''easily the biggest Warhol collection in the world after ours,'' says Tom Sokolowski, the director of the vast Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh -- and roughly 100 each by Jean-Michel Basquiat, Tom Wesselmann and George Condo. At 69, Jose remains largely interested in artists with connections to the Pop movement. Alberto and David, who are 38 and 37, respectively, have been accompanying their father to auctions since they were teenagers, and in recent years they've been deputized to seek out younger -- or at least living -- artists. It is at their instigation that the family now owns about 150 Hirst pieces. They have also bought and sold numerous significant works by Richard Prince and Jeff Koons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hirst sale constituted a vast repository of the formerly Young British Artist's themes and tricks, greatest hits reissued with just a note here or there to distinguish them from their predecessors. There were skulls, butterflies, paintings of colored dots that corresponded to pharmaceutical codings and, of course, animal and fish corpses suspended in formaldehyde inside giant glass vitrines. Among these were a tiger shark, a calf with 18-karat-gold horns and hooves, a zebra and a unicorn -- which was actually a foal with a resin horn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A number of the tanks were plated with gold and were so heavy that the floors of <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> had to be reinforced to withstand the tonnage. The auction house's printed estimates for the pieces ran from roughly $200,000 for small works to more than $23 million for some of the installations, with the fat part of the bell curve somewhere in the low seven figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mugrabis were given seats in the second row and arranged themselves according to family protocol. Alberto, the more outgoing and incautious son, was beside Jose (''He likes to sit next to our dad, and I let him,'' David said). David, dispassionate and analytical, was between his wife, Libbie, and Alberto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They were not assigned paddles, because, as David explained, ''the auctioneer knows where to look for us.'' Gazing across the audience himself, though, David barely recognized anybody. ''Except I think I see Bianca Jagger, and I think I saw Russell Simmons.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The family was not selling any of its holdings at the auction, but the Mugrabis' fortune is so tied to their pet artists -- like Warhol and Hirst -- that they were rooting for a series of bidding wars. ''We're not looking for bargains here,'' David said. ''Because it's very unwise as invested as we are in Damien to hope the sale doesn't do well. We want to keep the prices up. We'll try to get some things, but we'd like to see other collectors bidding high.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the Mugrabis' preferred artists, the family doesn't merely operate in the art market; it is the market. ''They're so invested, they're like the casino, not the gambler,'' said the gallery owner Francis Naumann, a friend. What threatens them at an auction is not the presence of other aggressive bidders but cautious bidders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If it's good for <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> and Christie's, it's good for us,'' Alberto said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The family admitted to some unease about the front-loaded order in which the pieces were being auctioned. Of the 56 lots on the block the first night of the sale, the two highest-valued by far were coming early. These were the tiger shark (Lot No. 5) and the calf (No. 13). ''I'd rather have, in my opinion, a little more momentum before the formaldehyde,'' David said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first four lots sold quickly, for more than their high estimates. The brothers put in an early bid of $:380,000 (about $685,000 at the time) on a red-and-white butterfly painting they'd been eyeing but gave up long before it was sold (for $:590,000).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then came the shark. Alberto started trading text messages with Hirst, who was apparently playing snooker at a pub but eager to receive a play-by-play of the auction. Jose worried a string of black beads with his fingers and chewed gum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bidding began at $:2 million but quickly stalled at $:3.2 million -- below the low end of the house's estimate, which was $:4 million to $:6 million. The auctioneer, Oliver Barker, looked beseechingly at two long tables, which were lined with perhaps three dozen <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> employees, each manning a telephone to field remote bids from collectors across the globe. But none of them proffered a bid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Three million three hundred thousand pounds -- want to come in?'' Barker said, repeating the challenge for nearly a full minute. He did not want to let the piece get away so cheaply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Not good at all,'' Alberto said. Jose stared wordlessly at Barker, then turned his head to look around the room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But before the hammer went down, a remarkable thing happened. Jose sat up and began waving his hand, to get the auctioneer's attention. Then he motioned toward one of the phone attendants, who he could see was still talking to somebody on her line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barker kept on going, and a new bidder came in. There was another lull -- the piece almost sold at $:3.7 million -- but an auction-house staff member on another phone could be heard successfully coaxing her bidder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once the low estimate was reached, a couple of other would-be buyers bid $:4.5 million, $:4.6 million, $:4.7 million and beyond -- in no time, all the way past $:8 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jose caught the eye of his friend Gabriel Safdie, a Geneva-based curator of private collections who sat nearby, and winked. ''You see?'' Safdie said quietly. ''It was almost dead at 3.2.'' The hammer finally landed at $:8.5 million -- which, once <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> commission and taxes were added in, translated to a $:9.6 million payout, or about $17.2 million. The room broke into applause.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberto received a text message from Hirst and smiled. ''Damien made one of these symbols,'' he said, sticking out his tongue to demonstrate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And from there, the auction was a cakewalk -- more than $200 million over the next 24 hours (there was a day session the following afternoon). The Mugrabis bid on a few pieces for which they ended up dropping out early with a swat of a hand or a shrug at the auctioneer. Toward the evening's end, when the brothers decided they didn't want to go home empty-handed, they exchanged a knowing glance, and Alberto kept himself in the running for one of the last pieces long enough to win it -- a small canvas with cigarette butts affixed -- at $:121,250.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A souvenir,'' Alberto said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few minutes earlier, Jose had been talking about the incongruity between the day's financial news and the auction frenzy, and ventured an interpretation: ''When the empires fall -- Roman, Greek -- all that is left is the art.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE OVERWHELMING majority of the Mugrabi collection -- of their 3,000 works, all but about 200 at a time -- resides out of public view, in two warehouses they rent, one in Newark and the other near Geneva. Alberto said it was the only practical solution for a collection of its size, particularly with large pieces like the Hirst tank installations. ''Sadly, the whole thing has to be dismantled and drained,'' he said. ''The sharks and the sheep need to be refrigerated.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As private dealers, the Mugrabis do not own a gallery or represent artists. They buy or sell works in about 100 art auctions annually, nearly one every three days (sometimes, with smaller auctions, they bid via phone). And the rest of the time, they buy and sell through galleries and fellow dealers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're market makers,'' Alberto said. ''You can't have an impact buying one or two pictures per artist. We're not buying art like Ron Lauder -- just to put it on a wall. We want inventory.'' He equated inventory with liquidity: ''It gives you staying power.'' In the commodities sector, the analogue would be making a run on a precious metal -- in order to manipulate the price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the coming months, the Mugrabis may lose the ability to make that claim. After all, the art market has visibly begun to ebb. Prices -- and interest -- dropped at the November and February auctions in London and New York. At Christie's and <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> big November contemporary sales in New York, nearly one-third of the 138 pieces went unsold. Christie's total receipts of $113.6 million came in at half the low estimate of $227 million. <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> totaled $125 million, falling well short of its low estimate of $202.4 million. Totals for the contemporary artworks sold by Christie's, <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> and Phillips in February were $:43 million, down from $:250 million one year before. The auction houses have been laying off staff, and galleries in Chelsea have been shuttered. Dealers who will be at the Armory Show, which is New York's pre-eminent contemporary art sale and which will take place from March 5 to March 8, have drastically reduced their expectations from what they have come to refer to as ''2007 and 2008 levels.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nobody knows yet what the future business of art will look like, but price escalations on the order of Richard Prince's series of nurse paintings -- $50,000 in 2003, $300,000 in 2005, $1 million in 2006 and $8.4 million in the summer of 2008 -- are most likely not in the picture. (In November 2008, a nurse painting with an estimated value of $5 million to $7 million was bought at auction for $2.9 million.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mugrabis, however, insist they will be able to continue doing what they do, regardless of how the ground may have shifted beneath their feet. ''We'll become more like collectors and less like dealers now,'' David said. ''More buying, less selling. It's like Warren Buffett said -- a down market is when you find the bargains. Not that much that is special has come up yet, but when it does, we'll be there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One morning a few weeks ago, Alberto wandered into his father's office in New York as Jose was on the phone with an art dealer in London. In Spanish, Jose was agreeing to purchase a group of five Basquiat paintings for about $9 million and outlining the payment schedule ($5 million upfront, with the remainder to come in half-yearly installments by 2011).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Yes, yes, buy them all,'' Jose said in English. His assistant came in with cafe con leche on a lacquer tray, and he put his fingers to his lips to signal to her to get his superslim cigarettes ready.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Jose hung up, Alberto explained that the week before, they freed up the cash for this purchase by arranging to sell a different Basquiat of theirs, for around $2.5 million, and a Wesselmann painting for $3 million. ''So there's the $5 million,'' Jose said. ''You never know what will come up. I saw photos of the pictures, I talked to the guy for two minutes, I buy them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Basquiat we sold, we had three that were practically the same -- all car crashes,'' David, who had joined them, said. ''We bought this one in '89 for $308,000 and now we sold it for more than $2 million.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the economic downturn, the Mugrabis said that the value of their collection was approaching a billion dollars. ''If it's two-thirds or three-quarters of what it was, just like everything else, so be it,'' Alberto said in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Art will hold its value better than the rest of the things, better than real estate, better than funds,'' Jose claimed, just before the London auctions in February. But now he estimates that works by the ''top tier'' of artists are worth a lot less what they were a year ago. With so much of their money tethered to the market values of a small group of artists, the Mugrabis hardly own a diversified portfolio. If, for whatever reason, they needed to raise a large sum of cash in a hurry, they could find themselves being forced to sell low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mugrabis give the impression that, no matter how well they have played the market up to now, their compulsion to buy and sell art is not entirely rational. Back in the early 1990s, when Jose was still making his ascent, he got ''a little overextended'' purchasing art, he said. Asher Edelman, a financier and art dealer who is acquainted with the Mugrabis, said that about five or six years ago, Jose told him over lunch that he was ''nervous'' about being overinvested in art. ''I told him, 'Look, why don't you sell off some of your collection, stop buying, and you can lay low for a few years?' and he said that was a good idea,'' Edelman recalled. ''Then he kept on buying.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the November auctions in New York, the Mugrabis put 30 pieces up for sale, and Alberto said that half of them -- including a Basquiat with a high estimate of $2 million -- went unsold. They also bought a Wesselmann painting for nearly $1 million, $300,000 above its high estimate. ''We're addicts,'' Alberto said. ''That's what addicts do.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE WAY THE MUGRABIS built their collection owes a strategic debt to Charles Saatchi, the English advertising man turned art patron. In the 1980s, Saatchi was moved to buy up multiple works by expensive artists. ''Most collectors were satisfied to have, say, one great David Hockney piece, and one great Cy Twombly and so on, but Saatchi was the first to realize there were a dozen great Twomblys, and he could own all of them,'' said Richard Polsky, an art dealer in Northern California and the author of ''I Bought Andy Warhol,'' a book about the contemporary-art market. But Saatchi did this with many artists, and his focus remained on their best works, whereas the Mugrabis are indiscriminate when it comes to their preferred artists. ''They've bought up everything Warhol -- even the stuff that was considered junk,'' Polsky said. ''And a lot of the junk has turned out to be very valuable, too.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their business model today puts the burden of decision-making not on taste but on whether a piece they're considering buying will aid their ability to affect the scarcity of the artist's work. Once, in 2006, Polsky said, he put up for auction a Warhol ''Flowers'' painting in which he owned a stake. ''The estimate was $1 million, but the <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> auctioneer made it clear that the Mugrabis would be in the audience and they would like to see it get $1.5 million,'' he recalled. ''And that was almost exactly what it ended up selling for.'' The Mugrabis didn't purchase the piece. They just bid against the eventual buyer and ratcheted the price upward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's a good strategy in a rising market,'' said Jeffrey Deitch, a gallerist who has bought and sold many paintings from and to the Mugrabis over the years. ''In a down market, we'll have to see how it works.'' More art that was until recently considered hard to get will likely come up for sale, making it more difficult for the Mugrabis to create artificial scarcity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were always criticisms of overpaying. At an auction in New York in 1988, Jose paid nearly $4 million for Warhol's ''Twenty Marilyns,'' which consists of a repeated iconic head shot of the actress against an orange background. At the time, it was the record price for a Warhol -- more than twice the estimate -- and Jose hesitated. ''I had to push his hand in the air to make the bid,'' Alberto recalled. ''I was 18 years old. He was upset with me afterward.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was upset but I was not upset,'' Jose said. ''People were making fun of me. The guy from the Figaro called to ask me if I knew what I was doing. I told him, 'I felt like I was buying a piece of America.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just last year, Jose said, members of the Abu Dhabi royal family offered the Mugrabis ''several hundred million dollars'' for a group of works that included the painting. ''It was a very attractive offer, but we decided not to,'' Jose said. ''As long as I am here, it will be in my home.'' Technically, the brothers added, nearly everything in their collection is for sale. ''If we don't want to sell a picture, we ask like three times what the estimate would be,'' Alberto said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the circuit they travel, Alberto and David are regarded as princes of art and commerce, but culture was an acquired taste in their household, something they grew into alongside their father. Mary Mugrabi said her husband was at first deeply unmoved by her interest in art. ''I bought him his first picture 30 years ago,'' she recalled. ''He said: 'Why? What is this for? Who cares?' '' Previously, on their honeymoon in Madrid, she took Jose to the Prado. ''He said, 'Who cares?' '' Mary said. But when he became interested, she added, ''he moved so fast, I could not keep up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That began in 1982, when Deitch, who was then an art consultant at Citibank, talked Jose into purchasing a Renoir landscape for $121,000, as an investment. ''He knew my account,'' Jose recalled. ''He started to insist that it is good to buy the Impressionists. I said, 'O.K., buy me anything you want under $100,000.' They insist on sending me the catalogs. Eventually, I begin to pay attention.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jose's parents were Syrian Jews who ran a grocery store in Jerusalem. In 1955, when he was 16, he went alone to Bogota to live and work with relatives. ''The business of my uncle was shmattes,'' he said. He began as an office gofer and did everything from selling cloth to running errands. In 1961, he started his own wholesale fabric business and eventually became an importer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''By the end of the '70s, the business became one of the biggest textile merchants in Colombia,'' he said. ''At the same time, it became very dangerous to live in the country -- a little kidnapping, you have to go with a bodyguard, you have to have an armored car.'' By the time his sons were around 12 and 13, he said: ''It became risky to send them to school. So we go to America.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jose struggled -- first in Miami, then in New York -- to establish his business, which set in motion the decision to throw his time and resources toward his new hobby. ''In Colombia there was no fashion,'' Alberto said. ''My father would go to Italy and bring back last year's fabric and nobody cared -- the women wore dresses for three days in a row. The business model'' -- selling out-of-date fabric -- ''didn't work in America. So then it became art, art, art.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1987, Jose was at Art Basel, the annual collectors' fair in Switzerland, when he walked by the booth of a German dealer who was selling Warhol paintings. ''I liked the pictures,'' Jose said. ''I told a friend and he said, 'This is late Warhol' -- not so important. I said: 'I don't know what you mean. The paintings impact me.' The feeling I had -- before, it was nothing. Then, at that time, I feel something.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jose bought all four paintings in a ''Last Supper'' series for $37,000 each (he estimates that each is worth $4 million to $6 million today), then quickly dismantled his nascent but not-insignificant collection -- by then it included Mark Rothko, Salvador Dali, Yves Klein and Honore Daumier -- to buy Warhols, Basquiats and Wesselmanns (''His three revelations,'' David Mugrabi called them).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He has a good eye, but to say that this is the artwork I am going to put all of my money into, basically overnight -- it took such confidence,'' his friend Gabriel Safdie said. ''He had the belief, the capacity to assimilate, compute all the inputs, purify it, get rid of the fat and keep the caramel. He was buying Basquiat for $8,000 a picture, this man.'' He has since sold Basquiats for as much as $6 million and $8 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In keeping with the janitor-to-fabric-king arc that everybody in the family relishes, Jose loves to talk about the market trajectories of artists he didn't invest in. ''In the 1960s, you could buy Warhol for $3,000, and you could buy Richard Lindner for $30,000,'' he said, chuckling. ''Now a Lindner is worth $200,000.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the economic fortunes of Lindner and Warhol suggest, the art business -- the selling of taste, of authenticity, of goods that can be deemed by turns rare, innovative or irrelevant -- is a squishy industry, even in the best of times. The Mugrabis cannot know how much the market valuation of different works by different artists will rise or fall, or whose work will rebound more quickly, or not at all, after the art market reaches its bottom. Might Damien Hirst turn out to be the Richard Lindner of our times?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I remember Alberto stopped by the museum four or five years ago -- it was the first time he'd ever seen it -- and I was giving him a tour,'' said Sokolowski, of the Warhol Museum. Sokolowski was struck by Alberto's appraisal of a ''Last Supper'' painting. '' 'Oh, that's beautiful,' '' he recalled Alberto saying. '' 'If I were you, I'd put an insurance value of $15 million on that.' I said, 'Oh, Alberto, you can't do that.' But to them, it would become sort of a self-fulfilling science to say everything is worth what you want it to be.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE MUGRABI MEN ARE DARK, economically built and strikingly angular in their features -- especially Alberto, who looks as if he could have emerged from a Picasso canvas (''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon'' period). They operate out of a small office on Park Avenue at 57th Street. There are walls of bookshelves stacked floor to ceiling with artists' monographs and auction catalogs, but the doorway plaque and their e-mail addresses bear the name of Jose's textile business, Fashion Concepts Incorporated. When others in the art world talk about their moves and their taste, it is always under a collective umbrella -- as in ''The Mugrabis don't want it'' or ''That was bought by the Mugrabis.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's rare to see any of the three Mugrabi men without at least one of the other two. They take breakfast together at the Four Seasons Hotel, or lunch at the restaurant in Lever House, the landmark midcentury office tower where Alberto and the building's owner, Aby Rosen, have commissioned and displayed a number of major pieces (including a 2007 Hirst installation for which they paid $10 million). In London, they rendezvous at Aspinall's, Jose's Mayfair gaming club -- though Jose prefers that Alberto play roulette at a different table. ''He only likes his privacy when he's losing money,'' Alberto joked on the night before the Hirst sale, as each of them frittered away thousands of pounds on each spin of the wheel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sons talk about the art world as if it were the only place where any of them was meant to function -- as if other environments were not only too plain but also rigged against newcomers (and art, at least, was rigged for them). It can sound like a vestige of their third-world -- if wealthy -- upbringing. Alberto said that he and David went to somewhat-obscure colleges near Boston -- Bentley and Babson, respectively -- because they were ''the only schools that would take us. We didn't know anybody. We hadn't been in this country that long.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David often chides his older brother for not having married yet and for being a bit of a playboy. (David has two young children, lives on Park Avenue and goes to bed early; Alberto has lavish dinner parties at his Gramercy Park apartment and employs full-time household staff.) ''My father is able to pretend not to like a picture as much as he does, in order to get a better price,'' David said one day. Then he pointed at Alberto and said, ''Him?'' David shook his head.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Alberto is much more emotional, and I admire that,'' Jose said later. ''But sometimes you can't buy a picture because you don't have the money. Sometimes we don't have the money, but Alberto still buys.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David does credit Alberto for saving him from his former career as a financial broker-dealer. ''I would call Alberto every morning when I got to work,'' David said one day at his parents' Trump Tower apartment. ''I was staring at a computer, and he was going to three-hour lunches, going to look at pictures, going to Paris. It was just much more enjoyable.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jose, who was in the room, smiled at his son. ''Much more,'' he concurred.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mugrabis' approach to art -- to the extent that it supports a specific characterization -- combines a sort of immigrant aesthetic with immigrant entrepreneurship. Jose described the artists they're fondest of as representing the ''true American commercial culture'' (Basquiat, Prince, Koons and even the Englishman Hirst) or ''what America gives to the rest of the world, like <span class="companylink">Coca-Cola</span> and jeans'' (Warhol). They almost never share their collection with museums or galleries without charging a fee. ''But not much -- like one or two million dollars,'' Alberto said. Last year, when Jose learned that a sculpture by the Cuban duo Los Carpinteros he'd just donated to the Guggenheim was requisitioned to storage, he bought it back. ''From now on, if I make a gift, I tell them, 'You have to expose the art,' '' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sheer volume of the family's collection strikes some people as something that is in opposition to the public good. ''It's not that they don't love art,'' Charlie Finch, a columnist for Artnet.com, said. ''They've just been hogging everything. Come on, let someone else in on the game.'' It is often pointed out by fellow collectors that a number of patrons who own work on the level of the Mugrabis, like Saatchi, Eli Broad and Don and Mera Rubell, have opened museums to show off their art.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What others see as hoarding, the brothers attribute, at least in part, to their father's wary nature. For years, the sons endured a sort of apprenticeship during which only their father could make decisions. ''Now both of us can buy what we want,'' Alberto said. ''But we talk everything through before we do it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1998, Alberto paid around $250,000 for his first Hirst piece, a laboratory cabinet filled with medical supplies. ''My father saw it and said, 'What is this disaster?' '' Alberto said. ''He wanted to chop my head off. I said: 'Don't worry about it. This is great.' He said, 'No, this is not great.' He hated it so much, he made me sell in a year. It's probably worth $3 million now.'' (He gave that figure in August but says it's more like $1 million today.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He's always asking us: 'Who's the next Warhol? Who's the next Basquiat?' '' David said. ''But he's skeptical of whatever we bring him.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One such artist, George Condo, said his relationship with the family began in the late '90s when a mutual friend brought Alberto to his studio to look at a painting of a jazz-album cover. ''I remember him saying, 'You've got to meet my dad,' '' Condo recalled. ''I think he put a reserve on it, and his father wouldn't let him buy it. But a few years later, they started buying my pieces in depth.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condo considered it a pretty big stamp of commercial approval: ''They're prestigious collectors. To see your own paintings in one of their apartments, hanging next to a beautiful Basquiat -- it feels great.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHEN THE DAMIEN HIRST auction ended, Jose rushed to the pulpit to high-five the auctioneer, then departed for a quiet dinner. David and his wife did the same. That left Alberto heading into the night through Mayfair ''to find Damien and celebrate.'' Alberto returned to his hotel, Claridge's, where Hirst has been living for much of the past year, but was unable to locate him. One of Hirst's assistants appeared in the lobby and informed Alberto that the artist was with his children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alberto took a seat in the hotel lounge, where a party formed around him: Diane von Furstenberg, the fashion photographer Sante d'Orazio, friends of Hirst's who had been with him, playing snooker, when the ''scores'' from the auction came in. There were shout-outs to others who walked by: Ron Wood, Jack Black, Ben Stiller and William F. Ruprecht, the chief executive of <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span>, who entered making exaggerated, open-mouthed winks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In one hour, 71 million pounds,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They said it was Black Monday -- well, not for Damien,'' Tony Shafrazi, a gallerist from New York, said. ''It was magic, it was. It was rainbows. This proves that art is more important than money.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Damien Hirst should be running <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span>,'' Alberto said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People hear my music and they say, 'Oh, that's your passion,' '' said Antony Genn, a friend of Hirst's who used to be in the band Pulp. ''I say, 'Forget that.' '' Music, Genn said, ''is my life,'' and added, ''Damien Hirst came from nothing, and then, with aplomb, he goes and changes the world.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Ant! Ant! You'd rather not eat than give up your art,'' Alberto said to Genn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It got late, and Alberto headed upstairs to bed before the entire crowd dispersed. ''Tomorrow, I will get up, and I'm going to <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> for the day sale,'' he said. ''I want to buy a few more Damien pictures.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A picture caption on Feb. 26 with an article about the slow pace of home sales erroneously included information about a drop in value for the home shown for sale in the Pacific Heights area of San Francisco. It is not known whether the value of the home, relative to its peak value, has dropped 40 percent. The caption also overstated the overall decline in value for homes in Pacific Heights. The homes have dropped 21 percent from their peak -- not 40 percent, which, as the article noted, is the drop in value for all homes in the San Francisco metropolitan area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Sat Mar 07 2009 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes fell 5.3 percent in January from December, an industry group reported Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors reported that existing-home sales, fell to an annual rate of 4.49 million in January, the slowest rate in more than a decade. Sales were down 8.6 percent from January 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median home price fell to $170,300, its lowest point since March 2003. The median price in January was down 26 percent from its peak of $230,100 in July 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, a closely watched gauge of housing prices reported that single-family home prices fell 18.5 percent in December from a year earlier, the fastest rate on record, and economists said that housing would probably continue to sink as buyers wait for the economy to improve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chris York and Rebecca O'Connell are two such buyers. For the last year, they have been looking to move from Mr. York's one-bedroom condominium to a three-bedroom home in northeastern Massachusetts or southern New Hampshire where they could start a family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple say they intend to spend $350,000 to $400,000 but that many homes in the area still seem overvalued. They have made two bids -- one for $25,000 below the asking price, and another for $60,000 below the asking price -- but have not been able to work out a deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We continue to go into houses and think, 'Yeah, maybe we'll buy this house if it drops another 30 grand,' '' said Ms. O'Connell, 32, who works for a marketing services company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with no pressing need to move, they can afford to hold out for a better deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We can sit around and wait,'' said Mr. York, 33, a civil engineer. ''We'd like to buy a house tomorrow, but we know we can wait and find the perfect house.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their broker, Richard Rosa, said many other would-be buyers were circling the real estate market, tempted by falling prices in Massachusetts towns like Chelmsford or Billerica but hesitating because they expect that if they wait three months, they could get an even better deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said sales were slowest in more affluent communities, where housing values have held up, but have picked up in towns where values have fallen the farthest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales in January were up in the more distressed corners of Southern California and the San Francisco Bay area, according to the property research firm <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span>. Home values in the Los Angeles and San Francisco metro areas are down some 40 percent from their peaks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors estimated that foreclosures or distressed sales -- among the cheapest homes available -- made up 45 percent of sales in January. The Obama administration has laid out a $275 billion plan to help as many as nine million families refinance their mortgages or avoid foreclosure using a variety of incentives and government subsidies to reduce interest rates and principal amounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, home sales were flat in the West. They dropped 5.7 percent in the Midwest and the South, and fell 14.7 percent in the Northeast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory of unsold homes fell to 3.6 million nationwide from more than 4.5 million last summer. At the current rate of sales, it would take 9.6 months to exhaust the excess supply of homes.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ON May 1, 2007, a very different economic era, Janet Faello put her former marital home on the market for $829,000. She and her husband were divorcing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It seemed like a good price for the house, a six-bedroom, three-and-a-half-bath ranch in Dix Hills, in Suffolk County on Long Island. But it didn't sell at that price, or at $750,000, where it landed six months later, or at $699,000, where it stands now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not the Taj Mahal, but it's a nice, well-maintained home,'' said Ms. Faello, a 53-year-old massage therapist with two daughters in college who remains in the house, which she and her ex-husband still jointly own. Her ex-husband lives elsewhere. ''I haven't been entertained once with an offer, and I'm still not getting any bites.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the house unsold, Ms. Faello said she and her ex-husband are struggling to meet expenses. Taxes alone are $13,860 a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm not ashamed to say to you, I have had to borrow money from my father,'' she said. ''We each want to move on. We're just hoping and praying things will turn around.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Would-be sellers in New York City's suburbs understand her pain, whether they are trying to sell a Cape Cod for $300,000 or a center hall Colonial for $1 million. In a housing market characterized by eroding home values, high inventory and tight credit for borrowers, many feel stuck in a place they don't want or can't afford. As the recession becomes more severe and unemployment mounts, they fret each week their properties remain unsold, and fear losing equity. While buyers hunt for exceptional values, sellers feel like hostages. And their pain is sometimes drawn out when deals that seem to be done blow up just before the closing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have an offer and we've accepted it,'' said Ray Lopez of Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y., a manager for <span class="companylink">Metro-North Railroad</span> who has been trying to sell his house since last March. Last year he signed a contract, but learned two weeks before the closing that the buyer could not get a mortgage. While he hopes the current deal will go through, he said he won't relax until three weeks after the closing. ''Anything could happen,'' he said. ''You don't know till you have the check in your hand.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All real estate is local, as brokers like to say, and comparable sales information is most useful within a smaller neighborhood, because prices vary so much even within one community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, all the reporting agencies are concluding that the number of sales of single-family homes in 2008 was down from 2007 in the New York metropolitan area, and prices in general were down. The median price for a home sold in the metropolitan area was $458,600 in the fourth quarter of 2008, down 11.7 percent from a year earlier, according to the National Association of Realtors. Those figures reflect the agency's tracking of sales in Bergen, Hudson and Passaic Counties in New Jersey; and the Bronx, Kings, Putnam and Westchester Counties in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Connecticut, the median price of a single-family home sold in 2008 was $268,000, down from $295,000 the year before, according to the Warren Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of pending home sales in the Northeast, meanwhile, decreased 14.5 percent from December 2007 to December 2008, according to the National Association of Realtors. And some experts are warning that the housing market may not hit rock bottom for at least another year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A seller's anguish may not be as sharp as the pain of a homeowner facing foreclosure. But the situation can alter life plans and jettison hopes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some sellers are losing hope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider Mary Beth Lang of Shelton. She is 62, with grown children and a husband who retired as a buyer for a technology company. Her dream went like this: sell the house and move to their new custom home in Kentucky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her five-bedroom, four-bath house went on the market for more than $1 million in 2006. The price has since slid to $875,000, but there are no takers. Repainted, with many personal effects removed to look less cluttered, it no longer feels like home. The Kentucky house? It's for sale, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Sometimes dreams just blow away,'' Ms. Lang said. ''Everything is incredibly depressing. Of course, there are people with sadder stories.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conventional wisdom holds that well-priced, attractive and aggressively marketed homes will sell. Now that is not necessarily true, said Cynthia Lippolis, principal broker with River Towns GMAC Real Estate in Croton-on-Hudson. ''I have some good listings that are priced very well and attractive, yet they are sitting there,'' she said. ''The economy is holding everyone back.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Bednar, a real estate agent representing buyers at DRI Real Estate Company in Ridgewood, N.J., said many sellers overvalue their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The industry has nailed into people's minds that their houses are worth a certain amount,'' said Mr. Bednar, who blogs about the New Jersey market at njrereport.com. ''Sellers remember what neighbors sold their houses for two years ago and hold on to those unrealistic comparables. They need to accept the current reality of the market.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bednar said he knows that sellers do not always have the leeway to drop their price. Others will be asked to pay a steep price for features buyers consider undesirable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In a boom time, buyers tend to overlook things like a high tension line that's a little close to the house, a street that's a little too busy or an odd layout,'' Mr. Bednar said. ''In a down market like this, those preferences are magnified.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JONATHAN GREENBERG paid $792,000 for a lake house in Montville, N.J., in 2005, attracted by its unusual architecture and striking views. Then he invested nearly $100,000 in improvements. At the time he was single, but is now married and a father. With its steep slopes and 30-foot drop to the lake, the property is not ''kid-friendly,'' said Mr. Greenberg, who sells investment properties for a living. He listed the house a year ago for $930,000. The price is now $670,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People say they love it, but it doesn't have some of the fundamentals families are looking for,'' said Mr. Greenberg, 41, whose wife, Malu, is expecting a second child. ''It'd be perfect for New Yorkers who need some kind of getaway. It's stressful. We do feel stuck.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some sellers manage to find equilibrium in limbo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pamela and Daniel Greenhall of Aberdeen Township, N.J., have been trying to sell their ranch-style home since May, when they learned they were expecting a third child. Their house, priced at $279,900, has three bedrooms and one bath. Mrs. Greenhall, 33, a school counselor, and her husband, 33, a carpenter, bought the house for $235,000 in 2004 and took out a loan for renovations. ''If it sold, we wouldn't stand to make a dime,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month Mrs. Greenhall prepared for the new baby by converting one child's bedroom into a nursery and doubling the children up in the other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're blessed in that we can still afford it,'' said Mrs. Greenhall, who delivered a boy on Feb. 3. ''We're comfortable. Is it a little cramped? Yes. Am I being overtaken by toys? Yes. But that's O.K.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Margaret and Matt Brown, teachers in Westchester, took a similar approach. Last spring, when Mrs. Brown, 38, was pregnant with their second child, they listed their two-bedroom home in White Plains for $519,000. Within a month they reduced the price to $499,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the baby's birth approached, the couple took the house off the market. Just then a buyer offered $475,000, but the couple rejected the offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now it's $465,000,'' said Mrs. Brown, a little ruefully, referring to the current asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new baby arrived last June, and in January the house was put back on the market. On the Feb. 7-8 weekend the Browns staged an open house themselves, after listing their home on <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span>, placing advertisements in two newspapers and sending e-mail messages to everyone they know.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twenty-three people showed up. Mrs. Brown said that 11 knew about the open house from a sign outside; 6 spied the listing on <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span>; 4 were referred by friends; and one saw a newspaper advertisement. (One declined to talk.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, the Browns made an offer on a bigger house conditioned on the sale of their house. The owners accepted it, but are leaving the country and anxious to sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That puts a little pressure on us,'' Mrs. Brown said. After the open house she paid to list the house with an online multiple listing service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People who move into a new place before selling their old one feel even more stressed. Take Patrick Sweeney, 43, a father of three from Rowayton, who put his home on the market after he and his wife agreed to divorce and moved into separate homes. Mr. Sweeney is a builder who constructed the six-bedroom, six-bath house himself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house went on the market last month for $1,995,000, $300,000 less than Mr. Sweeney had banked on. There were no offers. He was surprised.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The thinking was always, 'It will sell in a heartbeat,' '' Mr. Sweeney said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is worried now, and he plans to drop the price this spring. ''This can't go on forever,'' he said. ''It's got to go. We're paying to keep the heat on.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In spite of the months without a buyer, Ms. Faello of Dix Hills is still optimistic that her house will sell, if she can just find the right approach. First she listed with a broker, then switched to an online multiple listing service that charged a flat fee. She also listed the property on <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span>, which cost her nothing, and on ForSaleByOwner.com, which charged. Recently she began interviewing new real estate agents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I feel as if I get a little sharper each time,'' she said. ''The amazing thing is, they'll see your home and come up with a number they justify by saying they've sold homes for that in the area. But list with them, and they're ready to drop the price.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHEN Robert Hamerslough and his brother, Daniel, put their late mother's four-bedroom house in Yonkers on the market last summer, they received assurances from a real estate agent that they would get top dollar for the tidy 1923 colonial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with an asking price of $799,000, higher than comparable properties in the neighborhood, the house -- even with its gleaming wood floors and welcoming fireplace -- attracted few lookers and no offers. ''This is a terrible time to have a house up for sale,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hamerslough brothers eventually lowered their asking price to $719,000. They also dropped the real estate agent and listed the house on forsalebyowner.com. It's one of a proliferating number of real estate Web sites attracting sellers who are opting to do the deal themselves and avoid paying a sales agent's commission in a down economy, industry officials said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like the Hamersloughs, many sellers today realize that the boom days are gone and that new marketing tactics are required, real estate officials said. The latest statistics show that the number of house sales in Westchester County dropped sharply at the close of 2008 compared with the year before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to a report issued on Jan. 26 by the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service, the number of sales of single-family homes, condominiums, cooperatives and two- to four-family houses in Westchester fell in 2008 by more than 26 percent, to 6,639, from 9,022 the year before. In 2005, when the market was sturdier, 10,524 homes sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most-watched number -- the median sale price of a single-family home -- held steady for most of the year as many sellers, like the Hamerslough brothers, resisted price concessions. But by the end of 2008, the median price for the year had fallen to $650,000, down 5 percent from the year before. For the fourth quarter of the year, the median sale price was $570,000, down almost 11 percent from the same quarter a year before, the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, inventory has increased, although not to worrisome levels, said P. Gilbert Mercurio, the chief executive of the listing service and the Westchester County Board of Realtors. As of Dec. 31, 2008, the number of houses (single family, co-ops, condos and multifamily) on the market in Westchester was 5,392, up 14.5 percent from the year before. As Mr. Mercurio noted in the report, those numbers are far below the annual levels of 8,000 or more recorded during the early 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking ahead, Westchester will be especially vulnerable to the vicissitudes of Wall Street, real estate officials said. The listing service's fourth-quarter closings reflect sales during the summer and ''do not at all reflect the impact of the economic chaos that commenced in October of 2008,'' Mr. Mercurio said. The damage to the real estate market from that period will not be officially known until the first-quarter numbers for 2009 are released in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A decrease in the average price of a house at the end of 2008 suggests that the high end of the market has already been affected by the loss of jobs and bonuses in the financial sector, the report said. For the first time since the listing service began tracking million-dollar-plus sales in 2000, there was a decrease in those houses' market share. The luxury market constituted 22.8 percent of Westchester's homes sales in 2008, compared with 25.4 percent in 2007 and 24.7 percent in 2006, the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Responding to the pressure on the high end of the market, Babette Ballinger recently dropped the price of her four-bedroom Dutch colonial on four acres in Yorktown Heights to $999,999, from $1.2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When you look around you and see terrific houses just sitting, you realize that it's a highly competitive marketplace we're in, and that the old ways of selling a home don't always apply,'' Ms. Ballinger said. ''You can't just depend on real estate agents. You have to be aggressive and get out there and market the house yourself.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She has also listed the house with one of the online services and said she would reduce the price even further if the deal is closed without the services of a sales agent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Leah Caro, the president and principal broker for Bronxville-Ley Real Estate in Bronxville, argued that especially in a tough market, sellers need seasoned professionals working for them. Moreover, with many homeowners behind on mortgage payments or facing foreclosure, agents trained to negotiate with banks are especially in demand, said Mark Boyland, president of the Multiple Listing Service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there is one bright spot in an otherwise grim market, it is the emergence of a new group of opportunists: first-time home buyers eager to take advantage of falling prices. They made up 41 percent of all buyers in 2008, up from 36 percent in 2006, according to a survey from the National Association of Realtors.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greenwich -- LORY GAMBRILL put her colonial-style house here on the market in September, the day after the government announced its takeover of the mortgage finance companies <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. At $1.75 million, it was considered well priced for the neighborhood, which boasts newer, larger homes -- and Carlos Delgado of the New York Mets among the neighbors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She expected it to be snapped up. ''My broker told me it wouldn't even make it to the open house,'' Ms. Gambrill said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seventy real estate agents attended the open house in October, but over the next five months it was shown only seven or eight times, she said. She rejected an offer of about $400,000 below asking price. ''It's impossible -- no one is buying anything,'' she said recently. This month, Ms. Gambrill asked her broker to take the house off the market temporarily.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of the mortgage crisis, layoffs and lack of consumer confidence, her story is being duplicated across the state. Housing prices have rolled back to 2004 levels, and will probably not level off until 2010, said Timothy M. Warren Jr., chief executive of the Warren Group in Boston, which tracks New England real estate sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The impact of the decline in sales as well as prices has been felt from Greenwich to Woodstock in the northeast corner of the state, and represents the steepest falloff in about 20 years, Mr. Warren said. There was not one month in 2008 in which sales increased from the previous year, his data showed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Statewide, sales of single-family homes plunged 23.66 percent last year and prices fell 9.15 percent, the data showed. In Fairfield County, the hardest hit, sales were down 31.27 percent and prices plummeted 11.97 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The kiss of death are those great big houses,'' said Ginny Green, an agent with Wheeler Real Estate in Darien, who has been in the business 33 years. Homes of 7,000 square feet or more, once a coveted size for masters of the universe looking to buy in the area, are now sitting on the market for months or longer, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And as the fortunes of local financiers founder, brokers expect more high-end homes to be put up for sale in the spring. ''That's the buzz, at least,'' said Kathy Lawten, an agent with Country Living Associates in New Canaan, who said she was working twice as hard for half the money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Darien took a major hit, with sales nose-diving 43.95 percent: Two hundred and thirteen homes sold in 2008, compared with 380 the previous year. The price drop was not as steep -- 3.38 percent, to $1,285,000 from $1,330,000 -- a sign that ''people aren't willing to bargain or can't afford to bargain,'' Mr. Warren said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New Canaan, sales fell 34.23 percent. According to Ms. Lawten, some sellers are going to great lengths to move their properties by offering decorating allowances and other incentives. To encourage real estate agents to attend open houses at his six unsold homes in Fairfield County, Steven Kerschner, a Norwalk developer, offered the agents a raffle for prizes that include a weeklong vacation in St. Thomas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other sellers are offering third-party home warranties as an incentive, said Dan Sperduto, the owner of Era Realty Pros in Niantic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To sweeten the deal for agents on a three-bedroom colonial in Darien, Ms. Green urged the owner to increase the sales commission to 3 percent from 2 percent. ''I don't know if it will make a difference,'' she admitted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of people are renting,'' Ms. Green said. ''They are in paralysis.'' Even demand for waterfront homes has dried up in her area, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Would-be buyers seem to be waiting it out, watching to see what impact the stimulus package may have on the economy and monitoring both home prices and interest rates, said Barbara L. Pearce, chief executive of H. Pearce Company, a North Haven-based real estate firm. ''It's bad,'' she said. ''The only thing that works is to price your home correctly, and most people won't do that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Norwalk and Darien, ''buyers are there, at low, low prices,'' Ms. Green said. ''They're what we call bottom fishermen.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices slid 5.3 percent last year in Norwalk -- to $500,000 from $528,000 in 2007 -- but the drop was smaller than that of most other Fairfield County towns: Prices declined more than 10 percent in Stamford, Stratford, Ridgefield and Trumbull, and 23.19 percent in Bridgeport. New Canaan's prices were down 7.72 percent and Westport's 9.43 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The upper end has been pretty slow,'' said Nancy Healy, the owner of Shore and Country Properties in Greenwich. This month, 155 homes were for sale there for $5 million or more, the top price at $95 million. Last year's sales dropped 40.22 percent, and the median price fell 11.25 percent, to $1.775 million from $2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The news is not all bad, however. The start of the spring market has brought out buyers in some towns. ''There is pent-up demand, and young families are coming out of Manhattan,'' said Bill Andruss, a broker with <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span> in Greenwich. First-time buyers and corporate transfers are also shopping, agents said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists also see a glimmer of hope. When adjusted for deflation, the price decline is not as steep as it seems, said John M. Clapp, director of the University of Connecticut Center for Real Estate and Urban Economic Studies. ''At the end of the year,'' he said, ''the state was losing ground less rapidly.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SINCE last fall, Kathy Wallach and two other real estate brokers, Bryan McMillen and Margaret Trautmann, have descended on the Syosset station of the <span class="companylink">Long Island Rail Road</span> every Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As commuters wait to board trains, the brokers hand out brochures promoting the property of the week along with a comparative market report for the last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are going face to face, eye to eye, the old-fashioned way,'' said Ms. Wallach, a broker with Daniel Gale <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>'s Locust Valley office who has been selling homes on the North Shore for 16 years. ''Everyone is nervous about the market.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2006, the number of sales of existing single-family homes has plummeted on Long Island. Sales declined 21.5 percent in Nassau County and 32.1 percent in Suffolk, according to the New York State Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the final months of last year, the median price in Nassau was $425,000, down 10.5 percent from the fourth quarter of 2007. In Suffolk, the median price was $355,000, down 11.2 percent from the fourth quarter of 2007, according to data from the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The news was gloomier last month even as real estate agents said that they are hoping that falling interest rates -- and now falling prices -- will spur some activity in the traditional busier spring market. Last month, sales closed on 461 homes in Nassau, with a median price of $385,000, down 12.5 percent from January 2008. In Suffolk, there were 484 sales, with a median price of $320,000, down 14.3 percent from January 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joseph Mottola, chief executive of the Long Island Board of Realtors and the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island, described the market as ''certainly softer than it was a year ago.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crisis on Wall Street, Mr. Mottola said, has hastened the drop in values, which had risen nearly 100 percent from 2003 to 2007. He called the current prices ''the inevitable return to the norm.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are no ghost towns on Long Island,'' he said, but he acknowledged the slowdown in sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are hot spots: sales in West Islip and Elmont rose in the last three months of 2008 compared to the previous year. But generally, the golden rule of real estate still applies, those in the business say: location, location, location. Good schools and access to transportation still make homes easier to sell, real estate officials say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Craig Bell, an agent at Prudential Douglas Elliman's Syosset office, said that although volume was down, top school districts like Jericho and Syosset remained ''very much of a draw.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In good times and bad, real estate officials said, the waterfront is a lure. ''It is not replaceable,'' Mr. Mottola said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, even homes on the Great South Bay or Long Island Sound are fetching less than they did a year ago. ''It is not immune,'' Mr. Mottola said. ''But the same house on the water will cost you more than the same house off the water.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also beckoning are projects near downtowns and transportation. Because the economy is forcing people to seek smaller homes, apartments and condominiums, smaller properties in these locations are gaining in popularity, said Eric Alexander, executive director of Vision Long Island, a nonprofit planning group. More than 70 projects that include attached town homes, condominiums, downtown apartment buildings and mixed uses are planned, approved, in construction or have been built, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tough times also call for new marketing strategies. Frank S. Urso, broker-owner of Long Island Village Realty in Syosset and president of the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island, said that brokers and agents ''have to adjust to what Gen X and Gen Y buyers are looking for more than they have in the past.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With younger buyers using social networking sites to find homes, Mr. Urso said, agents list homes on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and upload house tour videos on YouTube, including aerial searches to show if a house sits in the middle of a block or backs up to railroad tracks, and interactive floor plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''More marketing dollars are going towards the Internet,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers are also trying to add what the broker Shawn Elliott called a ''wow factor.'' To top off the gilded appeal of a waterfront Kings Point home, Mr. Elliott, broker-owner of Shawn Elliott Luxury Homes and Estates, said that the $9,995,000 list price included new his and hers cars: a Ferrari convertible and a Maserati coupe. ''It is the turn-on,'' Mr. Elliott said, and is attracting what he called ''the ego market.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After no one showed up at an open house recently, Stanley Sherwood, whose five-bedroom, four-and-a-half-bath East Hampton home was listed with Prudential Douglas Elliman in Sag Harbor, came up with a twist. Mr. Sherwood, an international tax lawyer, said he would consider swapping his home, which has a turret and a pool, for a Manhattan condo, co-op or other real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are no traditional buyers anymore,'' he said, hoping to find a swapper whose apartment is worth about the same as the $2.2 million listing price for his house.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A TYPICAL winter's day in Genoa, Nev., might include savoring a view of the snow-heavy Sierra Nevada, or a vista of fields dusted white. There might be cows and horses dotting the landscape, and pickup trucks rumbling and rambling up and down the roads. But a homeowner shoveling snow would be a rare sight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We call it Genoa snow,'' said Bill Bowersock, a retired financial executive who bought a second home for $279,000 in 1995 with his wife at the Genoa Lakes Golf Course. ''We're on the dry side of the Sierras -- we get about a tenth of the precipitation they get in Tahoe. So if you have four inches of snow in the morning, by 11 a.m., it's melted off the roads and by 2 p.m., you're on the golf course.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Genoa, with Minden and Gardnerville, make up the Carson Valley in a roughly 10-mile stretch of western Nevada. It's about an hour's drive south of Reno and 30 minutes east of Lake Tahoe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Carson Valley's mild climate and four distinct seasons are a big draw for second-home owners and retirees from Southern and Northern California; the relatively low real estate prices are also a lure. The valley, which has a population of about 40,000 and is surrounded by the Carson range to the west and the Pine Nut Mountains to the east, is about a four-hour drive from San Francisco and about eight hours from Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate agents say they are also seeing more people from the East Coast. Valley dwellers can avoid the crowds and higher property prices of Lake Tahoe, yet the lake activities in summer and ski resorts in winter are still less than an hour away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A region of about 425 square miles, the valley prides itself on its Old West heritage. It gets its name from the frontiersman Kit Carson, who passed through in the 1840s on a mapping expedition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Carson Valley also played a role in the 1849 California gold rush. Not long after gold was discovered, wagon trains flooded into the valley, said Laurie Hickey of the Douglas County Historical Society in Gardnerville. The immigrants grazed their animals on the lush valley floor and stocked up on provisions before trying the trip over the Sierra.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some stayed. Mormon settlers opened a trading post in what is now Genoa in 1851, and about 50 years later, both Gardnerville and Minden, a few miles away, were established.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Pretty much everything in Nevada started in the Carson Valley,'' Ms. Hickey said. ''This is where people put down roots.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Scene</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At an elevation of 4,700 feet, the Carson Valley has a high-desert climate -- cool nights and warm days -- but the foliage is thick and green in spring and summer. Near Genoa, the wooded foothills are often in shadows by midafternoon as the sun sinks behind the Carson range, which rises 3,000 feet above the valley. Just six miles away, where Minden and Gardnerville are linked by the north-south Highway 395, the contrast is stark -- the sky opens up over large expanses of flat ranchland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Minden has a small historic district with a few antiques and gift shops, restaurants and an old-fashioned town square, complete with a gazebo. But its charm is offset by long stretches of sprawl along the main road.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gardnerville is much the same. Look closely, though, and you'll find vestiges of its history. There are three Basque restaurants, for instance, serving dishes like oxtail or beef tongue stew, pigs' feet and tripe. After the gold rush and up until the 1960s, many Basque immigrants came to the valley to work as sheepherders; they later opened boarding houses and restaurants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We lost our last Basque boarder eight years ago,'' said J. B. Lekumberry, who, with his sister, took over the operation of the J. T. Basque Bar and Dining Room from their parents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Genoa, less than a mile square, has been largely untouched by development. Many of its houses were built in the late 19th or early 20th century on lots of less than an acre. Residents still get together to make 4,000 pounds of candy every September for the Candy Dance Arts and Crafts Faire, a fund-raising event begun in 1919.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's an upscale French restaurant, La Ferme, a bakery, and the red-brick Genoa Bar, opened in 1853, which claims to be the oldest bar in Nevada. Its owner, Willy Webb, said his clients ranged from bikers and ranchers to golfers and politicians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the region may have a small-town feel, world-class outdoor activities abound. In addition to the skiing and boating at Lake Tahoe, there is hiking, fishing in the Carson River, biking, hunting, horseback riding and especially golf -- four courses in the valley alone, and several more within an hour's drive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are big golfers,'' said Sondi Goldstone, a human resources consultant from Fremont, Calif. ''We had to have a place that had multiple golf courses.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June 2007, Ms. Goldstone and her husband, Buddy, a financial planner, bought a 2,900-square-foot house in the East Valley area of Gardnerville on four acres for $750,000 -- $125,000 under the asking price. They plan to retire there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Carson Valley is also known as a destination for glider pilots. ''The longest-distance flights in the Northern Hemisphere have been flown from Minden,'' said Leo Montejo, a doctor and glider pilot from Fremont, Calif., who flies his own small plane to the Minden-Tahoe Airport to spend weekends in Genoa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Montejo and his wife, Carlota Fenes, bought an 1880 carriage house last June for $400,000 and spent $160,000 on renovations. Their 4-year-old twins, Leo and Adriano, love the wildlife in the backyard -- deer, foxes, even the evidence of bears -- and their parents appreciate the amenities. ''Every morning we can walk to the bakery to get fresh French bread,'' he said, ''and right next door they have espressos that are as good as anywhere in Paris.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pros</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carson Valley's wide-open spaces will most likely stay that way. Residents in Douglas County, which includes Genoa, Minden and Gardnerville, recently voted for strict limits on residential development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cons</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Skiers leaving the valley for the Lake Tahoe ski resorts (Heavenly, half an hour away in South Lake Tahoe, is the closest) can face treacherous roads in winter. Drivers must carry chains, or have a four-wheel-drive vehicle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Real Estate Market</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in Carson Valley have dropped about 35 percent since the peak in 2006, said Lori Raschilla, an owner of Century 21 Clark Properties in Minden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You couldn't even have bought a starter home for under $300,000 a couple years ago,'' she said. ''Now we have some in the very low $200,000 range.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with communities on Lake Tahoe, where new homes cost at least $800,000 and an older home can't be had for less than $600,000, Ms. Raschilla said, the valley has bargains. At the low end, she said, there are small two-bedroom ranch homes in subdivisions like Chichester in Gardnerville and Sunridge north of Minden on half-acre lots. In the East Valley in Gardnerville, houses range from $600,000 to more than $1 million and tend to be larger and set on lots of several acres.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In and around Genoa, prices tend to be a bit higher, said Gina Gillmor-Coons, who owns Gillmor Coons Real Estate Group. They range from $284,900 for a 1,500-square-foot 1970s-era house on a half-acre in the Sheridan Acres subdivision to $8 million for a ranch on 203 acres.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AS the housing market shudders through another year of eroding prices, second-home buyers are finding a silver lining in the hundreds of thousands of foreclosures that now dot popular communities throughout the Sun Belt: bargains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sheer volume of foreclosures has pushed such sales from a somewhat arcane sideline into the real estate mainstream. And far from being rundown or neglected, many vacation homes now in foreclosure are just a few years old, with amenities like pools and high-end kitchens that appeal to second-home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finding and buying a foreclosed property is easier, too, thanks to a wealth of online tools and a growing familiarity with the process among banks and real estate agents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not an incidental thing anymore,'' said Ruth Ahlbrand, who, with her husband, John, owns ReMax Central in Las Vegas. The agency has 200 bank-owned properties among its listings and a team of agents who deal in foreclosures and distressed property. ''It's become a business that banks and the real estate industry have invested in to make work more efficiently,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Las Vegas, which lured second-home buyers during the housing boom with a wave of high-rise condominiums and new developments outside the city, has become something of the ground zero of the phenomenon. In January, nearly 80 percent of residential sales were foreclosures, according to the Greater Las Vegas Association of Realtors. The city's well-publicized foreclosure bus tours attract second-home buyers not only from around the United States but from Canada and Europe as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Susan Milliken and her husband, Bill Golberg, had been monitoring prices in the Las Vegas area from their home in Vancouver, British Columbia, and decided to take the plunge last summer, buying a 1,160-square-foot bank-owned foreclosure in the Sun City Anthem development, just outside Las Vegas, for $180,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two-bedroom, two-bath home, which the couple plan to use a least six months a year when Mr. Golberg, who is 62, retires, had previously sold for $285,000. Ms. Milliken, 54, estimated that the property's being in foreclosure probably saved them $50,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The prices were just so much lower here than in Vancouver,'' Ms. Milliken said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, more than 2.3 million properties in the United States received a default or auction notice, or were seized by lenders, an 81 percent increase from a year earlier, according to RealtyTrac, which collects default data. Of those properties, about 580,000, or a quarter of the total, were in Florida, Arizona and Nevada, prime second-home locations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while the market for foreclosed properties has traditionally attracted savvy professional investors, said Randy Paun, a real estate agent in Pensacola, Fla., buyers who plan to keep and use their properties as second homes are becoming more and more common.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are seeing many more family buyers going this route,'' said Mr. Paun, who said his business was now almost entirely foreclosure related. ''Now it's individual buyers looking for a deal.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of poring over default notices at the local county courthouse, buyers can turn to a crop of Web sites including RealtyTrac.com, ForeclosurePoint.com, ForeclosureS.com, <span class="companylink">Zillow.com</span> and others that provide full property details as well as maps and satellite images.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate experts caution that the abundance of foreclosed properties and the ease of finding them online does not guarantee a bargain. Depending on the type of foreclosure, some deals can involve a degree of risk and frustration, especially for the second-home buyer, who may be negotiating the purchase from a different part of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Ignorance is definitely not bliss when you are buying a foreclosure'' said Alexis McGee, president of ForeclosureS.com. ''Above all, don't pay market price,'' she said. ''There is no point in going to all this trouble if you are going to pay market price.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The level of difficulty is often determined by the type of foreclosure. Foreclosures generally find buyers in three ways: through a preforeclosure sale; through an auction; or through real estate agents who work for banks to help sell portfolios of seized property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a preforeclosure sale, the homeowner is usually in arrears and is trying to sell the property before it is seized by the bank. A buyer who steps in at this stage can often find a bargain but may have to negotiate with an often distraught property owner. And if the price turns out to be less than the bank is owed, called a short sale, the lender must also agree to the deal, which may take 60 to 90 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A buyer can sit there for two months not knowing whether they've bought a house or not,'' said Wayne Strickland, sales manager at Kitty Dunes Realty in Kitty Hawk, N.C., who said he received regular inquires from second-home buyers interested in foreclosures on the Outer Banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another type of sale is the bank auction, which Mr. Strickland described as a crap shoot for a second-home buyer. Buyers at bank auctions often lack the ability to do proper inspections, obtain title insurance and in some states must pay the full price of the home on the day of the auction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you are the winning bidder, you've bought a house,'' Mr. Strickland said. ''No backing out.'' And if the house you've just bought is occupied, you may then have an eviction to deal with.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Houses that don't sell at auction become known as real estate owned, or R.E.O. properties, and are the most transparent of foreclosure transactions. Buyers can do inspections, and the bank owner must deliver a ''clean'' title, ensuring there are no outstanding taxes or other liens. A potential drawback is that the buyer is dealing with a bank, not a person, and that bank may be in the process of trying to sell hundreds, even thousands, of other houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Dealing with the bank was one of the most unpleasant experiences I've ever had,'' said Nadia Nouri, 48, an executive account manager for a technology company in San Jose, Calif., who bought two houses last fall in the Summerlin community of Las Vegas. The houses, each about three years old, previously sold for more than $400,000, and were bought by Ms. Nouri and a business partner, Vance Bishop, 39, for around $250,000 each. One deal was with a private seller, closing in 30 days, and the other was with a bank, taking more than two months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You would think that banks would want to get these properties off their books quickly,'' she said. ''But they are slow and bureaucratic and seem to make everything as difficult as possible.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks say that they are working hard to get deals done but that foreclosures, by their nature, can be complex. ''When we get someone who is interested in a property, we often have to get approval from a third party because the mortgage loan has been repackaged on Wall Street and sold to an investor,'' said Jumana Bauwens, a spokeswoman for <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>, which bought the mortgage lender <span class="companylink">Countrywide Financial</span> last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with inventories of bank-owned homes expected to top one million by next year, banks are cutting prices more frequently to stay ahead of the rising foreclosure wave.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If banks don't price their properties below the market right out of the gate, they have already lost the race,'' said David McCarthy, chief executive of Integrated Asset Services, a company based in Denver that helps banks value and sell R.E.O. homes. He said some banks were now cutting prices as often as every 20 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chris Matty, chief marketing officer at ForeclosurePoint.com, said that in markets with large R.E.O. inventories like Phoenix, Las Vegas, San Diego and Miami, banks were now accepting offers at 20 to 30 percent below market value in order to move properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the deals are not only in the Sun Belt. David Odell and his wife, Susan, of Park City, Utah, recently bought two town homes in Park City that were in foreclosure and owned by banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the Park City market, it is the banks that are creating the floor on prices,'' said Mr. Odell, 45, ''and they are often willing to take a 30 to 40 percent haircut.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Previous sale prices for the homes were in the $450,000 to $500,000 range, but the Odells -- who run an Internet business devoted to cooking called foodell.com -- bought each for around $300,000. In both cases the bank responded to their offer within 24 hours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Odell said one house would be used by his parents when they come up from Texas for four months in the summer and would be rented to seasonal ski resort workers in the winter. He hopes to find a long-term tenant for the other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decision to start looking at foreclosed properties stemmed in part from his disillusionment with the stock market, Mr. Odell said, but also in part from a realization that the current market for foreclosed homes was very different from its traditional image.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We all grew up thinking that a foreclosure was a derelict property with all the windows broken and the doors hanging off,'' he said. ''But that's not how it is now. These are relatively new properties, and they are in foreclosure because people just extended themselves a bit too far.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The headlines generated by President Obama's speech on housing and separate comments from the Federal Reserve about the deteriorating economy did little to move stock markets on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as Mr. Obama outlined a $75 billion plan to give as many as nine million families assistance in refinancing their mortgages or avoiding foreclosure, a government report provided more gloomy news for the housing sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home construction fell to its lowest level on record in January as builders virtually closed up shop amid a plunge in demand, tightened credit markets and a flood of foreclosure properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department reported on Wednesday that privately owned housing starts in January fell 16.8 percent from December, to an annual rate of 466,000. That was the slowest pace since at least 1959.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The numbers show a housing market that is still declining after more than two years of slumping prices and lower demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home values, which rose steadily for more than a decade, have fallen by an average of about 25 percent from their peaks, and economists expect that prices will continue to slide as more people lose their jobs and the economy slips deeper into recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Housing and the U.S. economy are still in a free fall,'' said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS Global Insight. ''It's clear that we haven't done anything to stabilize housing. We haven't stabilized the rise in foreclosures. And until we do that, I think we're not going to see a bottom.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors seemed to take the housing report in stride.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones industrial average rose 3.03 points, to 7,555.63, while the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index fell 0.75 point, or 0.1 percent, to 788.42. The Nasdaq composite index fell 2.69 points, to 1,467.97.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil prices settled at $34.62 a barrel, down 31 cents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A day earlier, markets fell sharply on worries about the stability of banking systems in Eastern Europe and across the world, with the Dow sliding within reach of its lowest levels since the start of the credit crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banking stocks continued to lose ground Wednesday, with shares of <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span>, <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> and <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> each falling more than 4.5 percent. Analysts say that investors are likely to remain wary of jumping back into stock markets until they see some sign of a turnaround in the battered financial system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Treasury's 10-year note fell 30/32, to 99 30/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 2.76 percent, from 2.65 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, the pace of housing starts was 56.2 percent below its levels in January 2008, a sign of how much builders have scaled back construction. Single-family housing starts fell 12 percent from December, to an annual pace of 347,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits, which offer a glimpse of future construction, were also lower in January, falling 4.8 percent, to a seasonally adjusted rate of 521,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In normal times, builders need to construct 1.25 million to 2 million new housing units every year to keep pace with immigration, the natural growth of the country's population and the demand for newer homes, said James Glassman, senior United States economist at <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there is one bright spot to dwindling new-home construction, it is that supplies will eventually fall in line with demand. At the end of December, the inventory of unsold homes fell to a 9.3-month supply from an 11.2-month supply a month earlier, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Eventually that's how you get your inventory in line,'' Mr. Glassman said. ''The problem with the builders is that they're competing with property that's coming to the market from foreclosures. There's this tug of war going on between the resale market and the builders.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Obama is expected to address the foreclosure crisis and the floundering housing market, which lies at the center of the recession, in a speech later Wednesday in Phoenix. The administration has promised to use some $50 billion from the federal financial bailout to try to keep people in their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of housing starts in January was 56.2 percent below its levels in January 2008, a sign of how sharply builders have scaled back construction. Single-family housing starts fell 12 percent from December, to an annual pace of 347,000.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">The Downside For Condos In a Downturn</span>
</div><div class="author">By TERI KARUSH ROGERS   </div><div>2333 words</div><div>8 February 2009</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DURING the recent boom, buyers who coveted condos for their sex appeal could also make the case that condos were a smarter choice than co-ops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In theory, you didn't have to prostrate yourself, financially and otherwise, before a board for approval, and you could sell or rent pretty much to whomever you chose, should the need, or whim, arise. You could also put down a lot less money than the 20, 25, or even 50 percent of the purchase price customarily demanded by co-ops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as the city's fortunes buckle and heave, these very differences have potentially rendered some of the city's condo buildings dangerously exposed to the downturn. Then there is a distinction many condo buyers probably dismissed as a boring legality: If a condo unit is the subject of a foreclosure, the bank gets first dibs on the equity. With real estate prices way off their peak, that means some condo buildings will collect nothing but dust from residents who have also failed to pay their common charges, leaving the remaining owners to shoulder the burden of higher costs or reduced services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Defaults on common charges began to spike last fall, according to lawyers hired by increasingly jittery boards to file liens (the first step toward foreclosure) against owners in arrears.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We had maybe four or five before October,'' said Adam Leitman Bailey, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, referring to the number of liens his firm filed last year against condo owners in Manhattan and Brooklyn. ''It really got going this fall. We had 28 filings here and 17 in Brooklyn. These aren't in the wealthiest or the poorest buildings. It's the buildings with the younger 30- or 35-year-old professionals buying a $1 million to $2.5 million apartment, who haven't been working for 20 or 30 years and are relying on their job to pay for it.'' Other lien-filing lawyers said the pace had picked up by at least 10 to 25 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're seeing more, especially in the higher-end buildings where you never heard of foreclosures,'' said Adam D. Finkelstein, a real estate lawyer with Kagan Lubic Lepper Lewis Gold &amp; Colbert in Manhattan. Starting last quarter, his firm began filing two or three liens a month, up from two or three per year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to figures provided by the online research company PropertyShark.com, condo lien filings more than doubled in Brooklyn during the second half of 2008, and the number of filings in Manhattan zigzagged, with 156 in the first quarter, 186 in the second, 154 in the third and 203 in the fourth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the aggregate number of liens is still small (47 in Brooklyn and 67 in Manhattan in December, for example), they may be the first sign of trouble: Liens typically lag months behind defaults in common charge payments, and the bottom didn't truly fall out of the city's economy until last fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, barring a swift economic renaissance, lawyers, managing agents and condo boards are bracing for things to worsen significantly this year as job losses mount, severances and savings evaporate, and the new reality sets in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The world as we've been living in it for the last several years has changed seemingly overnight,'' Mr. Finkelstein said. ''We're at the very beginning of this.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While lawyers are reporting a similar rash of defaults among co-op owners, the risk to the building (and by extension to the defaulter's neighbors) is slight by comparison. That's because a co-op building is entitled to its share before the bank can claim anything in the event of foreclosure (the ultimate consequence of nonpayment of maintenance charges).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in condo foreclosures, the debt priorities are reversed. After a foreclosure process that these days can take two years -- during which unpaid common charges proliferate -- the building gets its due only after the bank is paid in full. And many condo owners have little equity in their apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think it's safe to say that the value of any apartment purchased in the last two years is less than its purchase price,'' said David Kuperberg, the president of Cooper Square Realty, a Manhattan property management company. ''The simple calculation is that if you bought an apartment a year ago and financed 90 percent of the purchase price, as many did, and now it's worth 20 percent less, you're upside-down as an owner.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even worse from the perspective of the condo building, if an apartment owner defaults on common charges but keeps up with mortgage payments, it falls to the building rather than the bank to pursue the foreclosure action.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In that situation, the building must pay the bank the entire balance owed under the mortgage. This prospect is so onerous in a down market that a vast majority of liens for unpaid common charges never advance to the foreclosure stage, said Aaron Shmulewitz, a real estate lawyer at Belkin Burden Wenig &amp; Goldman in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, buildings often sue the owners personally -- looking for other assets and garnishing wages, if there are any. But they are effectively powerless to force the expulsion of a deadbeat owner who has no equity. So far, there hasn't been an uptick in condo foreclosure filings in Manhattan and Brooklyn, according to PropertyShark.com. Instead, owners in financial distress seem more willing to play chicken with the condo board than with the bank, and they appear to have some wiggle room when pressed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bailey said that to date, a majority of defaulting owners had paid up once his firm had filed a lien.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The owners are hoping we won't file, and then they find a way to pay, whether they're borrowing it from relatives or using their last dime,'' said Mr. Bailey, who observed that the days of refinancing one's way out of debt were long gone. ''Usually they will pay for their home first, before credit cards and health insurance, because keeping a roof over their heads is their family's biggest priority.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the biggest priority for condo buildings is preserving cash flow. With smaller reserves dictating a more hand-to-mouth lifestyle than that of most co-ops, many have little choice but to assess owners if defaults grow large enough. Never welcome, increased assessments can push additional owners over the brink and into arrears. That is one reason many managing agents and lawyers have begun encouraging condo boards to forsake neighborly empathy and play hardball.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It used to be three months and then you'd file a lien, and now at the most it's two months and in many case it's just one month,'' Mr. Shmulewitz said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just how long to wait depends on a building's exposure. ''If two people are defaulting in a 200-unit building,'' Mr. Finkelstein said, ''you can probably exercise some leniency. But it's more problematic in a 40-unit building, even though it probably won't kill you. You've got to evaluate your risk. If you know someone has a very low mortgage and there's a lot of equity, you can cut them a little slack, because you can collect if there's a foreclosure.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While all condo buildings share vulnerabilities putting them at greater risk than co-ops to defaulting owners, condos of recent vintage appear to be in the greatest peril. For starters, these buildings often have less-experienced boards to navigate a crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The fear is much more acute in newer buildings than in established condominiums,'' said Mr. Kuperberg, the managing agent, whose company has helped about 40 buildings open in the past three years. ''There's a greater likelihood that many apartments were sold for more than they're worth today. And newer buildings have many people who bought with no-income-verification loans and very relaxed criteria. They also have younger owners who may be less established.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's more, many of these overleveraged, less well established owners are among the several hundred thousand who bought under the 421-a tax abatement program. As the 10-year abatements phase out in steps every two years, the recipients experience increasingly drastic tax increases -- which many had been counting on income gains to offset.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider the following hypothetical situation, provided by Paul J. Korngold, a real estate lawyer in Manhattan, which he said was consistent with many Manhattan units selling in the $1 million to $2 million range under the 421-a program. What starts out as a $1,214 annual tax bill climbs to $4,613 in the third year, $8,012 in the fifth year, $11,411 in the seventh year and $18,209 when the abatement expires.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But those numbers assume that the city doesn't raise assessed values or tax rates. Factoring in what Mr. Korngold called a historically conservative 3 percent combined average increase, the unit owner who begins with a $1,214 annual tax bill owes $10,046 in the fifth year and a staggering $32,887 when the abatement expires.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly 300,000 condo units were constructed under the program in the five boroughs from 2002 through 2007, according to the Department of Finance. That figure includes 132,431 units in Manhattan, where about 22,000 owners are in their fourth year of the program, 31,000 are in their fifth or sixth, and 12,000 are in their seventh. Because 421-a purchases were concentrated in a limited number of buildings, they are potentially destabilizing to these buildings in a down economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kuperberg sketched out a second chain of events, this one pertaining to new buildings with many unsold units. It unfolds like this: Unable to sell half the units in a building, a struggling developer stops paying common charges and defaults on obligations to the lender. Foreclosure by the lender may take years, while individual unit owners effectively wind up paying double their normal common charges. This pushes some owners, themselves struggling, into default. Meanwhile, they are trapped -- unable to sell, even at a steep loss, because most mortgage lenders won't lend to potential buyers in a building where half the units are in default.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That is a death spiral that could push a building into bankruptcy,'' Mr. Kuperberg said. ''You basically have a building unable to meet its operating expenses.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once the lender succeeds in foreclosing on the developer, there may not be enough money to cover the lender costs and unpaid common charges, forcing the unit owners to permanently swallow the loss. And while the lender must pay carrying costs going forward, it may decide not to throw good money after bad and instead dump the units at auction. The investors who buy them may act against the building's best interests -- renting them out cheaply (introducing a transient population that, among other things, inflicts more wear and tear) and electing boards who defer maintenance and refuse to make improvements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We work with a building that's about 50 percent sold and the developer is gone -- they lost all their money and they weren't able to sell,'' said one managing agent who asked to remain anonymous out of concern for the impact on property values in the building. ''The lender took over and pays the common charges but doesn't talk to us and won't return our calls. If you're running a building and 50 percent of the ownership doesn't give you direction, that's a problem. But I'm really nervous about what happens if the lender sells into the vulture market.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even condo boards in fully sold buildings have begun to contemplate the once unthinkable: slashing the very amenities that defined the recent boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The boards are starting to talk about cutting things that might be considered a little excessive,'' said Leslie Bogen Winkler, the vice president and director of management at Penmark Realty, a property management firm that has opened 50 condo buildings in the last three and a half years. ''They may reduce health-club hours and maybe scale back breakfast. The biggest amenities that are costly are the health club with a swimming pool. It can run up to $200,000 to $400,000, depending on the size, hours open and operator.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Staff cuts may also be in the offing at some buildings, though union contracts present significant hurdles. Moreover, said J. Brian Peters, the senior managing director of property management for Rose Associates, which owns or manages about 20,000 apartments in New York, ''you can cut positions, but at a certain level that's devaluing the product. And it's the best product that's going to survive the easiest in this downturn. We're really more focused on increasing revenue.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To that end, condo boards are considering adopting flip taxes, increasing alteration fees and bumping up sublet fees. They are also easing restrictions on the length of sublets so that strapped owners unable to sell their units can more easily rent them out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then again, other condos have the luxury of spare cash and might actually come out ahead in the downturn, Mr. Kuperberg said. ''The recession can be a good opportunity to buy capital improvements and do upgrades,'' he explained, ''because contractors don't have a lot of work and material costs are way down. It's an opportunity to invest not only in cosmetic things like the lobby but in infrastructure that could reduce operating costs.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LEHIGH ACRES, Fla. -- Desperation has moved into this once-middle-class exurb of Fort Myers, where hammers used to pound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its straight-ahead stare was hidden amid the chatter of 221 families waiting for free bread at Faith Lutheran Church on a recent Friday morning; and it appeared a block away a few days earlier, as laid-off construction workers in flannel shirts scavenged through trash bags at a home foreclosure, grabbing wires, CDs, anything that could be sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I knew it was coming,'' said Gloria Chilson, 56, the former owner of the house, as she watched strangers pick through her belongings. ''You take what you can; you try not to care.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Welcome to the American dream in high reverse. Lehigh Acres is one of countless sprawling exurbs that the housing boom drastically reshaped, and now the bust is testing whether the experience of shared struggle will pull people together or tear them apart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The changes in these mostly unincorporated areas outside cities like Charlotte, N.C., Las Vegas and Sacramento have been swift and vivid. Their best economic times have been immediately followed by their worst, as they have generally been the last to crest and the first to crash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Lehigh Acres, homes are selling at 80 percent off their peak prices. Only two years after there were more jobs than people to work them, fast-food restaurants are laying people off or closing. Crime is up, school enrollment is down, and one in four residents received food stamps in December, nearly a fourfold increase since 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Obama is scheduled to visit Fort Myers on Tuesday to promote his economic stimulus plan. But residents here tend to view it as the equivalent of an herbal remedy -- it can't hurt but it probably won't heal. Instead, in church groups and offices, people call for ''industry'' and repeat one telling question: ''What do we want to be when we grow up?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's one of the things we struggle with: What is our identity?'' said Joseph Whalen, 37, president of the Lehigh Acres Chamber of Commerce. ''We don't want to be the bedroom community of southwest Florida; we don't want to be the foreclosure capital.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Legacy of the '50s</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lehigh Acres, like much of Florida and many suburbs nationwide, was born with speculation in its DNA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The area got its start in the 1950s when a Chicago pest control baron, Lee Ratner, and several partners bought thousands of acres of farmland and plotted about 100,000 lots. With Fort Myers, 15 miles to the west, developers left little room for schools, parks or even businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What they sold was sun and quiet living.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They used to bring 20 busloads a day,'' said Bob Elliott, a former salesman for Mr. Ratner's company who struck out on his own in 1982. ''We had 300 customers, seven days a week.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By 2000, the lots had been sold, but most stayed empty. Only about 30,000 people were living in an area roughly four times the size of Manhattan. The builders really started to arrive in 2004, setting up model homes on Lee Boulevard next to Mr. Elliott's office with the faded wooden sign that said ''$50 lots.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bill Spikowski, a city planning consultant in Fort Myers, said that because Lehigh Acres had so many parcels and few restrictions on what could be built, smaller companies battled for customers. From 2004 to the end of 2006, developers completed 13,183 units in Lehigh Acres -- nearly doubling the total stock of 15,216 that existed in 2000, according to Lee County figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residents remember the boom for its noise, with dump trucks lining the streets and power tools heard in nearly every neighborhood. Housing prices doubled, then tripled, and jobs were plentiful, nearly all of them tied to real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signs of trouble were ignored. ''Sometimes houses would sell three or four times in a few months, and no one would move in,'' Mr. Elliott said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then in 2007, it all went quiet. Houses stopped selling. Foreclosures multiplied. The median home price in the Fort Myers area dropped to $215,200 in December 2007, from a peak of $322,300 in December 2005. It had fallen to $106,900 two months ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Work disappeared with the profits. According to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, Lee County lost a higher percentage of jobs (8.8 percent) from June 2007 to June 2008 than any other county in the nation. Unemployment in the county rose to 9.8 percent in November, from 3.5 percent in March 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lehigh Acres was particularly hard hit because it relied on construction. This was where the carpenters and exterminators of southwest Florida lived because it was more affordable or close to work. And by last spring, life as they knew it had come to an end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Downward Spiral</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trinkets for $1 were an early sign of trouble. Early last year, garage sales and estate auctions became more common in Lehigh Acres as families sold what they could to survive. No one seemed interested in buying whole houses, and foreclosures soon gave way to empty homes that became magnets for crime.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thieves stole air conditioner parts for scrap. And on distant roads with only a few new homes and faded blue street signs from the '50s -- on Narcissus Boulevard, on Prospect Avenue -- drug dealers moved in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2007 and 2008, the Lee County Sheriff's Department shut down more than 100 houses in Lehigh Acres where marijuana was being grown. In 2008, the police confiscated nearly 3,000 plants valued at nearly $7 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last winter, Charlotte Rae Nicely, executive director of Lehigh Community Services, noticed something else. More people were going hungry. Demand was increasing at the food pantry she runs at a nondescript office park, with dozens of new faces appearing week after week, even as the population was declining.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wondering what other social service agencies were experiencing, she decided to form a group that would coordinate assistance. It was the first sign that Lehigh Acres was fighting the recession in an organized way, and the group's mission appeared in its name: Team Rescue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The monthly meetings now include about a half-dozen churches, nonprofit groups, business owners and representatives from county government, including the sheriff's office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Discussion at one recent gathering centered on the host of troubles that follow unemployment -- issues that until recently had rarely been seen in new American suburbs. Hunger was chief among them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The organizations offering food in Lehigh Acres have seen demand increase by as much as 75 percent in the last year. And the people being served are no longer just the chronic poor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The line at Faith Lutheran included a mix of ages, races and former income levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luis Oquendo, 38, said he had been showing up for his weekly bread allotment since last fall, after full-time construction work disappeared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fred Csifortos, 62, a retiree surviving on $650 a month in disability payments, said the free food left more money for his medications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Megan Brown, standing in line with her well-dressed daughters, Kayley, 2, and Sydney, 4, had come because she feared the worst. Her husband still had his job, she said, ''but things are getting more and more tight.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Team Rescue, of which Faith Lutheran is a member, considers itself successful, not just because it has helped more families but also because organizers believe that the links they are forming will be the foundation of a tighter community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Nicely said she was especially encouraged by the Sheriff's Department's new ''weed and seed'' program, intended to revive Lehigh's most troubled neighborhoods by involving residents in community policing and cleanup.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And home sales in Lee County are picking up, running roughly even with foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Six months ago, you might get one out of 20 houses with a multiple offer,'' said Kevin Williamson, a real estate agent who has lived in Lehigh Acres for 22 years. ''A couple of weeks ago, I had one with 13 offers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But no one here would describe Lehigh Acres as out of the woods. Real estate agents said the homes that are selling here typically go for only about $45,000, a third of what they cost to build. They predict that foreclosures will continue to keep prices low for two more years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Job growth is also still nonexistent. Randy Burns, 50, the gregarious owner of Lehigh Discount Furniture, says he now receives 15 to 20 calls a week from people asking him to buy their furniture or help them move out of town -- and he said he planned to leave, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Until there's jobs and foreclosures stop,'' he said, ''nothing's going to change.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Latest Battle</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Creating a community in a deepening recession, many here now say, feels harder than dealing with a Category 5 hurricane. Panic is a powerful headwind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Voters defeated a proposal last year to incorporate Lehigh Acres, partly because residents feared higher taxes. And Team Rescue, for all its strength as a unified front, is still trying to figure out how to curb the spread of desperation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most recently the group has been struggling with a growing wave of families that either visit multiple food pantries using aliases or return the food to supermarkets for money or other items.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Nicely, at Lehigh Community Services, said that in November she started using a magic marker to blacken UPC symbols on cans so grocery stores would not accept them as returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We even had to do that on the toys for Christmas,'' Ms. Nicely said. Without such limits, she said, the neediest families might not be served.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, she often feels torn, saying, ''I can't be sure I wouldn't do the same thing if I was a single parent and my kids were hungry.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The needs are so strong now,'' she added, noting that there were more canned peas than peanut butter on her shelves because of growing demand. ''They've never been this big before.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A similar struggle between cohesion and chaos was also evident at a recent evangelical men's meeting, where 8 of the 15 members said they had been laid off in the last year. Even as the group had helped some of the men cope, others said their families had been broken up by the stress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then there is Ms. Chilson. She lost her house partly because of the boom (if not for easy credit, she might not have refinanced her mortgage a few years ago), the bust (which led to her husband being laid off from his pest control job) and overspending (which led to more than $20,000 in credit card debt).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She and her husband had lived in their simple green ranch house for 18 years, and the night they were kicked out, they stayed across the street with an elderly man whom Ms. Chilson had often helped with his medication.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Chilson put her couch in an old friend's house, her frozen steaks in another. And as she scrambled to find work and a place to rent, she decided to thank those she could.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At one point, she tried to vacuum a neighbor's house as an act of appreciation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the vacuum stayed quiet. Ms. Chilson discovered that the electricity had been turned off because the bill had not been paid. Any day now, she said, her neighbor will be leaving Lehigh Acres with all the others.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PERHAPS it is just as well that Brooke Astor, the grand dame of New York society, did not live to see the shriveling of real estate wealth and the loss of confidence now settling in on the elite blocks of the Upper East Side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When she died at 105 in the summer of 2007, buyers with what seemed to be bottomless bank accounts were bidding up co-ops on Fifth and Park Avenues and surrounding streets to ever-higher prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a new report on the luxury market now makes clear, that surge in conspicuous consumption among the wealthy continued to drive the entire Manhattan real estate market higher in 2008. Even after sales of lower-priced apartments faltered, the sale of co-ops, condos and town houses costing more than $5 million set new milestones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report, released last week by Stribling &amp; Associates, found that records were set last year that are not likely to be repeated anytime soon for co-ops selling for $5 million or more. These included the highest average and median prices; the number and value of sales; and even the highest price paid for a single co-op, $48 million, for a large duplex at 1060 Fifth Avenue facing Central Park at 87th Street. The value of all luxury town house and condo sales also reached new highs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It seems too obvious to refer to 2008 as the best of times and the worst of times, but there it is,'' wrote Kirk Henckels, the director of private brokerage at Stribling and the author of the report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late in the year buyers became wary. Many luxury co-ops priced too high in that hot market have lingered, losing their special luster in a new era of austerity, and at least some would-be buyers lost much of their liquidity in the faltering economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asking prices were cut and cut again, including that of Mrs. Astor's 14-room duplex apartment at 778 Park Avenue, with its five wood-burning fireplaces and red lacquered library designed by Albert Hadley. It had been listed with great fanfare at $46 million with Leighton Candler of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span> last May, when prices reached their zenith.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the listing had some challenges, despite Mrs. Astor's celebrity. The place needed work, and despite the vast space, the apartment designed for her was really just a very, very, very large one-bedroom. Last November, as the real estate market all but collapsed, along with segments of the finance industry, Ms. Candler threw the equivalent of a Hail Mary pass, dropping the asking price to $34 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That 26 percent price cut seemed huge at the time, but as sales continued to stall in the luxury market, large price cuts on luxury apartments became commonplace. Last week the price was cut once again, this time by another 15 percent, to $29 million, and the listing was turned over to a Stribling team: Mr. Henckels and Margaret Furniss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked why they had received the listing after having been passed over last spring, Mr. Henckels said, ''We were the ones who priced it right in the first place.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During 2008, the total value of sales of Manhattan apartments declined, cutting into the profitability of many brokerage firms, leading to some layoffs and the closing of some real estate offices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Henckels's report shows that the total value of sales of co-ops valued above $5 million rose by about a third, to $1.7 billion from $1.29 billion, in 2007. At the same time, the number of sales increased by more than 20 percent, to 157 from 128 the year before. There were 20 co-op sales for more than $20 million in 2008, compared with 11 the previous year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report showed a 26 percent increase in town-house sales for more than $5 million, and a review of similar condominium sales shows an even larger increase in sales of new condos, as luxury developments were completed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the situation turned around sharply in the fall. The report found, for instance, only eight co-ops in contract for more than $5 million as of the middle of last month, compared with 79 co-ops at the same time in January 2008, a 90 percent decline. Lower-priced apartments are now driving the market, brokers say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, brokers are nothing if not optimistic. In the last week or two, several luxury brokers noted an increase in showings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, a newly listed two-bedroom apartment on the 13th floor of 834 Fifth Avenue was said by brokers to have stirred a bidding war, and a quick deal close to the $30 million asking price. After the deal was done, a buyer came in with an offer above the asking price, one broker said -- just like the old days.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To the Editor:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Re ''Home Construction Ends Its Worst Year Since 1959'' (Business Day, Jan. 23):</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New research demonstrates that the floor on the housing market has not been reached and continues to be a drag on the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S.&amp;P./Case-Shiller Home Price Index for November 2008, published on Jan. 27, found record declines in home values around the country in November. The index of 10 cities is down 27 percent from mid-2006, having fallen each of the last 28 months.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These numbers underscore the critical need for Congress and the Obama administration to address the housing market in the stimulus package.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unless measures are taken to spur housing demand, home prices will continue to drop, further destabilizing the broader economy.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Enticed by tumbling housing prices, more Americans signed contracts to buy homes in December despite concerns about the economy, an industry group reported on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said that pending home sales rose 6.3 percent in December from a month earlier, with strong gains in the South and Midwest. The number of pending home sales -- those in which a buyer has signed a contract but not closed -- were up 2.1 percent from December 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But economists cautioned that December could prove to be nothing more than a bump in real estate's long slide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They rebounded from an all-time low, so the level is still low,'' said Patrick Newport, United States economist at IHS Global Insight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of pending sales for 2008 was down 9.5 percent from 2007 -- a sign of the toll that the tight credit markets had inflicted on the flagging housing market. The Commerce Department reported that new-home sales in December fell to an annual rate of 331,000, their lowest point on record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median home price in December was $175,400, down more than 15 percent from $207,000 in December 2007 and at its lowest point since May of 2003, the National Association of Realtors reported.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Home Construction Ends Its Worst Year Since 1959</span>
</div><div class="author">By JACK HEALY   </div><div>480 words</div><div>23 January 2009</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In further signs of the dire economic situation, new-home construction fell to record lows in December and jobless claims continued to soar, the government reported Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home construction fell 15.5 percent from November to December to an annual pace of 550,000 units, the slowest pace since the Commerce Department starting compiling the data in 1959. Home builders have all but shut down projects as home values plunge and potential buyers stay on the sidelines of the troubled housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What you're seeing is capitulation by home builders,'' said John Lonski, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Capital Markets. ''The news you got today reinforces the view that stabilization of housing starts is well off into the future.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of new-home construction in December was 45 percent below its levels from a year earlier. The government estimated that 904,300 housing units were started in 2008, a drop of 33 percent from 2007. Last year would be the worst for housing starts on record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve has cut its benchmark interest rates to record low levels of zero to 0.25 percent to try to revive the struggling economy and stem the losses in housing, and it has introduced new programs to buy mortgage-secured debt. But homes sales and values have continued to decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The magnitude of the housing bubble was unprecedented, and the corrective process promises to be a long and painful one,'' Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR, a forecasting firm, wrote in a note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department reported that weekly jobless claims rose 62,000 to a seasonally adjusted 589,000 for the week ended on Saturday. The nationwide unemployment rate has risen to 7.2 percent, and economists warn that the economy could reach 9 percent as the recession drags on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The worst is not over,'' Mr. Lonski said. ''Rising unemployment and tightening credit conditions are worsening the prospects for housing, which by itself suggests that we could be surprised at how poorly the economy performs in the early part of 2009.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower rates of construction mean that home builders are not contributing to the glut of homes on the market, currently estimated at 4.2 million. At the current rate of home sales, it would take about 11.2 months to absorb the existing supply.</p>

</div><div class="author">By DOUGLAS MARTIN   </div><div>984 words</div><div>16 January 2009</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>15</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trammell Crow, who began his legendary business career as the teller behind the window H-to-M at the <span class="companylink">Mercantile National Bank</span> in Dallas and rose to become one of America's largest real estate developers and landlords, died Wednesday at his farm near Tyler, Tex. He was 94.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The death was announced by Cynthia Pharr Lee, a family spokeswoman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forbes in 1971 and The Wall Street Journal in 1986 called Mr. Crow the largest landlord in the United States. The Journal said the company he founded was then the nation's biggest developer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Crow once had interests in nearly 300 million square feet of developed real estate, comprising 8,000 properties in more than 100 cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His projects, always done with partners, included the <span class="companylink">Dallas Market Center</span>, the Peachtree Center in Atlanta and the Embarcadero Center in San Francisco, and reached from Kansas City to Hong Kong to Brussels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Fortune magazine named him to the United States Business Hall of Fame in 1987, it called him ''one of the most innovative developers in history.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The traditional way of developing real estate was to use other people's money to build a building, depreciate it, sell it and then deploy the profit to start the process all over again with another building. But Mr. Crow's formula was to hold on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You can get rich selling real estate,'' he often said, ''but you can only get wealthy by owning it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">William Bragg Ewald in his book ''Trammel Crow: A Legacy of Real Estate Innovation'' (2005) wrote that many landlords try to avoid tenants for fear they might ask for something, but that Mr. Crow aggressively pursued fixing tenants' problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He signed customers to the shortest lease possible, saying this apparent sacrifice of long-term security allowed him to charge ever-higher rents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clinging to properties meant he needed deep-pocketed partners. He first recruited stalwarts of the Dallas establishment like the civic leader John Stemmons. As he expanded nationally, he enlisted backers like David Rockefeller and Winthrop Rockefeller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Undoubtedly his most important innovation, which he pioneered in 1948 on his first project, a Dallas warehouse, was to build buildings for which he had no tenants lined up in advance. He became, in his own words, ''a confirmed gambler, a speculative builder.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trammell Crow, whose unusual first name was taken from a family surname, was born in Dallas on June 10, 1914. At 10, he began taking paying odd jobs until his father, a bookkeeper, forbade it. As the Depression deepened, the family needed the young man's income, from jobs like plucking chickens and unloading boxcars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After graduating from high school in 1932, he worked as a bank teller and studied accounting at night. He passed his C.P.A. exam in 1938 and joined Ernst &amp; Ernst as an auditor. After serving in the Navy during World War II, he returned to Dallas in 1946.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He married Margaret Doggett in 1942. She survives him, as do his sons Robert, Howard, Harlan, Trammell S. and Stuart; his daughter, Lucy Billingsley; 16 grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Crow managed his wife's family's grain elevator business in Dallas. He began winding it down while looking for better opportunities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rayovac, the battery maker, leased space in a warehouse. When it decided to move to larger quarters, Mr. Crow put together his first real estate deal. He got loans from an insurance company and a local bank to build a warehouse on land he had bought from Mr. Stemmons. He leased half the building to Rayovac and soon found a renter for the rest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His business strategy was set. Mr. Crow and partners went on to build 50 warehouses in Dallas -- and much else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were nonetheless plenty of the ups and downs that characterize the industry. In the 1970s, high interest rates, mounting debt and a glut of office space combined to hurt the company so badly that it sold off many properties. But it never stopped building new projects. By the 1980s, it claimed to be the biggest real estate developer in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Crow stepped down as chief executive in 1977 but remained involved in deals. One that fell through was a plan for the Trammell Crow Company to be one of the developers of a wholesale computer and apparel mart from 40th to 42nd Street along Eighth Avenue as part of the redevelopment of Times Square. Mr. Crow made several trips to New York and personally steered the project before dropping out for undisclosed reasons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other partners also dropped out as the Times Square plan changed in almost every respect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Trammell Crow Company went public in 1997, and its shares began to trade on the New York Stock Exchange. In 2006, the company was sold to the <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis Group</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Crow was instrumental in bringing the Republican National Convention to Dallas in 1984. He and his wife were avid collectors of Asian art, for which they established a museum in Dallas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Crow also came up with the idea for a bronze sculpture erected in 1995 on a downtown Dallas plaza of three cowboys and 70 six-foot-high longhorn steers. The local art community sneered. Cynics suggested he was really trying to forestall a new hotel on the site that could compete with one he owned nearby. The historically inclined groused that Dallas, unlike nearby Fort Worth, was never really a cow town.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have about 8 or 10 pieces from Rodin in my buildings here,'' Mr. Crow said in an interview with The New York Times. ''Under their sort of criticism, we shouldn't have any sculpture from Rodin in Dallas. Rodin never even came to Dallas.''</p>

</div><div class="author">By JOSH BARBANEL   </div><div>843 words</div><div>6 January 2009</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>20</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For those New Yorkers who wondered what the Manhattan real estate market might be like without the ever-rising bonuses of Wall Street's elite, the answer is now emerging: an abrupt decline in transactions, tottering prices and buyers who are still looking but unwilling to sign a contract. Those are some of the conclusions in a series of market reports on the fourth quarter of 2008 released on Monday by brokerage firms, appraisers and other real estate analysts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices on completed sales of co-ops and condominiums, some negotiated months or years ago, were flat or down slightly, but the number of completed sales and newly signed contracts had plummeted, analysts said, as the economy faltered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pamela Liebman, president of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, a real estate brokerage, said that though the Manhattan market had continued to rise in the past year when most of the American housing market was in decline, it ''came to a grinding halt on Sept. 15,'' when credit markets collapsed and buyers lost confidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now we see the effects of buyers sitting on the sidelines, and they will remain on the sidelines until they get some confidence back,'' Ms. Liebman said. ''A lot of brokers are making friends with lawyers and doctors and all those people who were left behind in the heyday of Wall Street, three months ago.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One market report, by <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, found that the number of closed sales declined by at least 30 percent compared with the fourth quarter a year earlier as the Manhattan market all but stopped after the failure of <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> in mid-September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other reports, using different data and criteria, found somewhat smaller but still striking declines. A report by the Prudential Douglas Elliman brokerage found that resales of existing Manhattan apartments fell by 24.8 percent, to 1,408 sales, while the sales of condominiums in newly completed buildings rose sharply. Contracts for many of those new condominiums were negotiated in a different market, a year or more ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another report, by Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead Property, put the average apartment sale price at $1.45 million in the fourth quarter, up slightly from the same period in 2007, but down 2 percent from the third quarter last year. The median price was $895,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These reports found the average co-op price was $1.1 million, down 8 percent from the third quarter, but up 3 percent compared with the fourth quarter a year earlier. The median price of a co-op was down 8 percent from the third quarter last year and down 4 percent compared with the fourth quarter in 2007. The average condominium price was $1.7 million in the last quarter. The reports found that the number of transactions declined by 9 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But all the analysts agreed that the prices did not yet show the full impact of the recession, which will likely show up in closings in the first quarter this year. Jonathan Miller, an appraiser who prepared the data for Prudential Douglas Elliman, said that the prices of apartments in contract declined 20 percent between August and December last year, with an abrupt drop in late September and early October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Corcoran report noted that the number of listings on the market peaked in November, since some discouraged sellers took their apartments off the market in December. But the number of listings going into contract has fallen off each month since July. In December, the report showed 484 listings going into contract, a 57 percent decline from the 1,122 listings that went into contract in December 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The worst is yet to come; there is a blood bath coming,'' said Matthew Haines, a founder of the real estate site Propertyshark.com who prepared the Corcoran report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond the first quarter this year, assessments varied. A number of brokers said that as sellers cut prices, they will create an opportunity for buyers to get good deals that were unimaginable a few months ago, especially at a time when mortgage rates are falling. Several said they were counting on the Obama administration to bring in a wave of confidence that will change the psychology of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When the market solidifies itself and everyone feels confident that we are on solid ground, you are going to have hordes of buyers,'' said Diane M. Ramirez, the president of Halstead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But others worry that the market will need more than psychology to support it. Gregory J. Heym, an economist who prepared the reports for Halstead and Brown Harris Stevens, said that unless the economy strengthens, the weakening job market in New York City could further dampen enthusiasm for real estate. He said the city had lost about 18,000 jobs in the 12 months that ended in November, while city economists are now predicting a loss of 170,000 over the next year or two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Each time they update the forecast, it gets worse,'' Mr. Heym said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Construction spending fell less than expected in November as record activity on nonresidential projects helped offset another steep decline in housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said construction spending dropped 0.6 percent in November, less than half of the 1.3 percent decline economists expected. A 4.2 percent fall in housing construction was partly offset by a surprisingly strong 0.7 percent rise in nonresidential activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But economists expect that housing, which has been in a slump for two years, will continue to struggle. They also are concerned that nonresidential projects will falter as developers deal with a severe financial crisis that has curbed the appetite for new shopping centers and office buildings and made it hard to get new financing.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BY most accounts, the commercial property market reached its pinnacle in early 2007 with the <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group</span>'s acquisition of <span class="companylink">Equity Office Properties Trust</span> and its prized cache of more than 500 office buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $39 billion deal was the largest of a spate of mergers and acquisitions. Back then, trophy towers were a hot commodity for large investors with seemingly insatiable appetites for commercial properties and copious credit to buy them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(In fact, with the ink barely dry on its agreement, Blackstone, a private equity firm, was able to resell a big chunk of the E.O.P. portfolio.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the credit crisis and recession crushed deal making in office buildings in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From January through December, there were just 1,410 transactions nationwide, valued at $49.3 billion, versus 4,410, valued at $207.2 billion, for the corresponding period in 2007, according to the latest data from <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>, a research company. It predicted that sales would total $53 billion to $55 billion for all of 2008, further below a recently reduced forecast of $61 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, demand for offices has softened as companies have cut back or consolidated operations; many of them are already subleasing space that they no longer need. Office vacancies nationwide rose to around 13.5 percent by mid-December from about 12.5 percent, on average, in 2007, according to <span class="companylink">Reis Inc</span>., another research company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, all these negative conditions are taking a toll on investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some property owners are dealing with tighter cash flows and reduced profits from lost tenants or falling rental rates. In Manhattan alone, rents are expected to plunge 10 to 20 percent by 2010, and nationally by 5 to 15 percent, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield, the commercial broker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shareholders in real estate investment trusts that focus on office properties have watched their returns plummet as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industry analysts expect little improvement this year. ''It's safe to say that it's going to get worse before it gets better,'' said Maria Sicola, the executive managing director of research at Cushman &amp; Wakefield, noting, too, that the office market tends to lag the overall economy because of its long leases. She said, ''2009 will be a difficult year -- we'll continue to see job losses in many regions of the country.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 1.9 million jobs have been lost since January 2008, about a third of them among office workers, and many of those are in the troubled financial services industry, according to Raymond G. Torto, the global chief economist for <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>, the commercial brokerage firm. He predicted that as many as two million more jobs could vanish by the end of 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the positive side, new development remains under control. ''This was our saving grace,'' said Sheila K. McGrath, a real estate analyst at <span class="companylink">Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods</span>, explaining that high construction costs and tighter financing had helped to curtail new projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what can investors do to minimize their losses until the next growth cycle?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For landlords, whether they own trophy towers or modest suburban buildings, the advice is simple. ''You will need to maintain cash flow and tenants and minimize expense -- that's your only strategy right now,'' Mr. Torto said. ''As an owner in a highly illiquid market, it's too late to sell,'' except at distressed prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what about buying? That question seems harder to answer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you're a buyer, you're looking for prices to settle lower,'' Mr. Torto said. ''Some buyers cautiously see this as an opportunity. This is a time when core trophy properties become available, and they would never be able to get in that market before.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, a big investor could find deals in distressed or potentially troubled properties; in a recent report, <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span> identified 649 of them nationwide. Those on the list included several Manhattan office buildings that were acquired through Blackstone two years ago by Macklowe Properties. Macklowe, in turn, gave them up because of financing problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Blackstone was extremely savvy -- or very lucky -- by disposing of the E.O.P. property as quickly as it acquired it,'' said Paul E. Adornato, a senior real estate analyst at BMO Capital Markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the smaller investor, there may be some buying opportunities in modest buildings outside urban areas, as well as in office REITs, which are dividend-paying companies that hold portfolios of properties. The office REIT sector over all was trading at a discount of nearly 36 percent to net asset value in mid-December, according to Mr. Adornato.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Office REITs had a 44 percent loss, on average, for the year through Dec. 30, according to the latest data from the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, compared with a 40.5 percent loss for all property REITs during that same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industry analysts urge investors to exercise caution when picking REITs, however. ''While we acknowledge deep discounts available, we don't necessarily see a catalyst now to get the stocks moving,'' Mr. Adornato said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, he and others maintain that some office REITs are better positioned to weather the anemic economy and tight lending environment, and they advised investors to pay close attention to company balance sheets, focusing on cash reserves and debt levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You want to look at who's got loans coming due,'' said Ritson Ferguson of ING Clarion, explaining that refinancing can be dicey these days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of their lower-than-average leverage, Mr. Ferguson said, he is relatively optimistic about <span class="companylink">Vornado Realty Trust</span>, <span class="companylink">Highwoods Properties Inc</span>. and Office Property Trust. He said he also preferred <span class="companylink">Boston Properties Inc</span>. because it has longer-than-average lease terms -- ''north of seven years'' -- on its buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. McGrath, meanwhile, said she favored Alexandria Real Estate Equities, which specializes in laboratory space. While the REIT was not immune to the economic slowdown, she said, she viewed its ''concentration in life science and lack of exposure to financial tenants as a positive.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Adornato also ventured from the plain-vanilla office companies. He was positive about <span class="companylink">Douglas Emmett Inc</span>., which owns office space, along with apartments, in ''high-barrier-to-entry markets,'' where there are often obstacles to new development. He singled out another REIT hybrid, <span class="companylink">Liberty Property Trust</span>, which owns office and industrial property in diverse regions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While most analysts see few regions as particularly strong, some are upbeat about the Washington area, given the continuing demand from the federal government and the incoming Obama administration. ''I think defense intelligence will remain a top priority for the country,'' Mr. Adornato said, ''and you need office space for that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was also more bullish about so-called Class A buildings, which are often in superior locations and attract the highest-quality tenants and rental rates. ''I would think that the Class A property will likely do better,'' he said. ''The tenants who could not afford Class A before would be able to move up from Class B as prices are lowered.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How bad has the housing market gotten? With home values dropping by faster rates each month, a real estate agent near Detroit said that if houses weren't priced as low as foreclosures, they simply would not sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That grim assessment underscored numbers released Tuesday showing that home prices in 20 metropolitan areas across the country dropped at a record rate of 18 percent in October from a year earlier as the fallout from the financial collapse reverberated through the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the measure, the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case Shiller Home Price Index, all 20 cities surveyed reported one-year price declines in October. Prices in 14 of the 20 metropolitan areas fell at a record rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''October was clearly the free-fall month,'' said David M. Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>. ''Everything was going against us in October, without exception.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After increasing steadily through the first part of the decade, home prices have fallen every month since January 2007, their slide accelerating as troubles in the housing market infected the broader economy and brought down financial firms. Now, as buyers sit on the sideline and a glut of unsold homes clogs the market, economists say that home prices might continue to slide throughout 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's just been an absolute downward trajectory,'' said Michael Darda, chief economist at MKM Partners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to another report released Tuesday, the December survey of consumers by the Conference Board, overall consumer confidence dropped to its lowest levels on record this month, after rising slightly in November, as Americans braced for a long recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only 6.6 percent of Americans said that business conditions were good, and 6.2 percent of people said jobs were plentiful, down from 23.6 percent a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices in every metropolitan area in Case-Shiller's 20-city index dropped from September to October, and six of them -- Atlanta, Detroit, Minneapolis, Washington, Charlotte, N.C., and Tampa, Fla. -- posted record one-month declines. The index excludes many midsize metropolitan areas and some large cities, like Houston and Philadelphia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The numbers show that the cities that had the greatest gains in the housing boom are now suffering the steepest drops as a flood of lender-owned homes and distressed sales hit the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices in Las Vegas and Phoenix, where developers built subdivisions stretching into the desert, fell by nearly a third in October from 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices in Miami fell by 29 percent. There, homeowners who tried to wait out the market are paying a price, said Madeline Romanello, a real estate agent with Douglas Elliman. Sellers who turned down offers of $700,000 for a house they had listed for $900,000 are now scrambling to sell for $550,000, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices in New York declined 7.5 percent in October over the same month a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fourteen of the 20 cities in the Case-Shiller survey posted double-digit declines for the year. The relative winner was Dallas, which had the smallest decline, 3 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Realtors said that foreclosure sales and distressed sales dominated the market, forcing other sellers to lower their prices or take their homes off the market and wait.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If the house doesn't have a foreclosure price on it, even if the owners aren't in foreclosure, buyers aren't even looking,'' said Kathy Buterakos, a real estate agent in Grand Blanc, Mich. ''It's the worst I've ever seen it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To stimulate interest in open houses, she has sent out bulletins to neighbors, posted notices in gyms and local apartment complexes and had her sister put up fliers at a hospital. But no one has responded, Ms. Buterakos said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller numbers were the latest round of bleak news for the housing sector, which is at the center of the country's broader economic troubles. Foreclosures, bad loans and collapsing housing prices contributed to the financial crisis earlier this year, and now the widening recession is dragging housing down even more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, the National Association of Realtors reported that sales of previously owned homes, which dominate the market, fell to the lowest rate in years. Home values tumbled 13 percent in November from a year earlier, the sharpest drop in more than 40 years, the industry group reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A glut of unsold houses is weighing down the market, and housing is likely to deteriorate further in 2009 as the jobs picture continues to weaken. Unemployment is at 6.7 percent, its highest point in a decade, and is expected to rise further next year, to above 8 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People who think they're going to lose their job don't buy a home,'' Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Mizuho Securities</span>, said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ON the eve of a new year, it is becoming clear that the real estate market in Hudson County, the ''Gold Coast'' zone just across the river from Manhattan, will have to wait at least two years to celebrate a more prosperous era.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once New Jersey's hottest market for high-end condominiums -- drawing streams of Manhattanites -- Hudson now finds itself with 24.1 months' worth of unsold inventory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a much bigger backlog than exists in Brooklyn, which has a 13.8-month supply, and it exceeds unsold inventory levels in Queens; in Orange, Rockland and Westchester counties in New York; and in Fairfield County in Connecticut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Long Island, the unsold inventory is also swollen. It would take 20.9 months for all the houses and condos currently on the market there to find buyers, given the current pace of sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new assessment of the region prepared by the Otteau Valuation Group presents a generally unlovely picture of residential sales markets:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan now has an 11.8-month supply of unsold inventory, said Jeffrey G. Otteau, whose Old Bridge, N.J., company analyzes contract sales figures and advises real estate brokers. ''This is not terribly big,'' he said, ''but it is significantly bigger than a year ago -- and much bigger than the days when multiple bidders were circling around every available unit on the market.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are a few other areas encircling Manhattan that also maintain what might be described as less-than-albatross-sized inventories, including:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Passaic County in New Jersey, home to the large suburban communities of Clifton and Wayne, which has a 12.9-month supply of housing on the market;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Union County, N.J., home to Elizabeth, Summit and Westfield, which has a 13.8-month supply;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morris County, N.J., an area with 150 towns, including Mendham, Morristown and Mountain Lakes, which has a 14.1-month supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across New Jersey last month, the pace of sales fell 30 percent below the same month in 2007. In October, the drop was 28 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before that, according to various market reports, there had been a brief, sharp uptick around the region, ascribed to lower mortgage rates and asking prices. But Mr. Otteau's numbers clearly indicate that once the banking crisis, job losses and bailouts began in October, sales fell and inventories rose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Hudson County, home to Hoboken and Jersey City -- an area known as ''Wall Street West'' -- sales were 26 percent fewer in November than the month before, and 47 percent fewer than in November 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking further ahead, Mr. Otteau has recently raised the issue of potential overbuilding in Hudson County -- in addition to his contention that outer-ring suburbs already have a surfeit of single-family housing on large lots that will not appeal to buyers of the next decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One large developer in Hoboken, the Applied Development Company, stopped building anything other than rentals as of nearly two years ago, said its president, David Barry. ''We saw the condo market getting ahead of itself, and becoming temporarily overbuilt, for sure,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But of the rentals that Applied is moving ahead with, several developments are in Hudson County. ''We just started on 225 Grand, a 348-unit rental in Jersey City,'' Mr. Barry said, ''and we're preparing to start with the Berkshire, 93 rental units, at the Shipyard.'' The Shipyard is an Applied rental/condo complex on the Hudson in Hoboken.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It will be about two years before these come online,'' he said, ''and when the economy does turn around, my experience is that the first market to benefit from that is the apartment market. As jobs are added, the first thing that happens is many people go out and rent an apartment.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Land costs have become ''more reasonable lately,'' Mr. Barry added; as a developer, he is seeking to capitalize on ''an opportune time to get in the ground with apartments.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condominium developments that have already posted strong numbers of sales contracts -- like the Trump Plaza Jersey City -- will most likely continue to sell units during this ''off time,'' he said, but starting new condo construction at this point is ''plain crazy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the ''suburban sprawl'' single-family-home developments that New Jersey policymakers have long been trying to rein in, Mr. Otteau predicts the market will only worsen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales pace is slack in the northwestern part of the state, where large-lot single-family development prevails. The inventory backlog is 23.6 months in Sussex County, 21.6 months in Warren County and 16 percent in Hunterdon County, according to the Otteau numbers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the more urbanized northeastern New Jersey counties of Bergen and Essex, the residential backlog approaches 16 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Likewise, in New York State, the inventory in outlying boroughs and counties is very large compared with that of Manhattan and Brooklyn. Westchester County has the next-largest inventory to Long Island, at 18 months. Orange County's inventory is nearly 18 months, and Rockland's is 14.5. Mr. Otteau foresees a ''structural shift'' in housing demand that will come into sharper focus in the region when the overall market improves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Right now we are all focusing on how bad it is,'' he said, ''but what we are also seeing is a historic reversal of home-buying demand away from suburban and rural areas to cities and inner-ring suburbs that are more walkable than driveable.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Otteau says the shift was partly because of higher energy prices. But the dominant reason is that the number of households with children living at home is on a persistent decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In 1985,'' he said, ''50 percent of households had children at home. In 2000, that was down to 33 percent. Today it is 29 percent, headed to 25 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That means that 75 percent of home buyers over the next 15 years will have childless households -- and within that group are empty-nester baby-boomers, or couples or singles buying a first house. And that means that three out of four home buyers will have no interest in a house in the suburbs with a good school system, which is pretty much what we've created over the last 50 years.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Otteau cited a new study from Virginia Tech projecting that a nationwide surplus of 22 million suburban homes on lots larger than a sixth of an acre will be languishing on the market by 2025.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DEPENDING on how you measure it, 2008 could go down in the history books as the best or worst of real estate markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though brokers and analysts say that prices on contracts signed in the last few months have fallen sharply, the decline has not yet worked its way into the official records, the closed transactions filed with the New York City Department of Finance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A review of city filings suggests that when the final reports on the fourth quarter of 2008 are released early next month they will show that average and median prices on closed transactions increased slightly over the previous quarter and held their own compared with the same quarter in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, average prices lagged about 14 percent from the peak in the first quarter of 2008, but by far less, only 2 percent, when the hugely expensive condominiums at the Plaza and 15 Central Park West are excluded from the calculations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average co-op prices were off 6 percent from the last quarter and 16 percent from their peak. Condominium prices were off 12 percent, but when the past sales of the two luxury condo projects were excluded, condo prices reached a new peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Behind these completed transactions is a dark picture. During the last quarter, the number of transactions plummeted by 30 percent from the third quarter of this year, and about 15 percent from the fourth quarter of 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lag in reporting prices in New York is particularly long for two reasons: Co-op sales that require the approval of co-op boards, and sales in new condominiums that have gone into contract many months or even a year before closings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal company Miller Samuel Inc., said prices in recent contracts fell 15 to 20 percent, which will show up in lower closing prices in the next quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts worry that with the loss of tens of thousands of high-paying jobs in finance, it may take many months or years for the real estate market to turn around.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corrections Appended</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are team-oriented, highly ethical, extremely competitive, profit-oriented, risk-averse, consumer-focused, and we try as much as possible to squeeze out any ego. Hubris is the beginning of the end.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Herbert Sandler, June 2005</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN FRANCISCO -- Herbert Sandler, the founder of the Center for Responsible Lending, is standing in his bayfront office watching a DVD that trains brokers to pitch mortgages by extolling the glories of the real estate boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The video reeks of hucksterism, and it infuriates Mr. Sandler.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I would not have approved that!'' he declares. ''I don't think we should be selling our loans based on home prices continuing to go up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the DVD was produced in 2005 by a mortgage lender that Mr. Sandler and his wife, Marion, ran at the time: <span class="companylink">World Savings Bank</span>. And the video was a small part of a broad and aggressive effort by their company to market risky loans at the height of the housing bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Sandlers long viewed themselves -- and were viewed by many others -- as the mortgage industry's model citizens. Now they too have been swept into the maelstrom surrounding who is to blame for the housing bust and the growing number of home foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once invited by Congress to testify about good lending practices, the Sandlers were recently parodied on ''Saturday Night Live'' as greedy bankers who handily sold their bank -- and pocketed $2.3 billion in shares and cash -- in 2006 before many of their loans began to sour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, the United States attorney's office in San Francisco announced dual inquiries into whether World Savings engaged in predatory lending practices or misled investors about its financial well-being. And the bank has been sued by numerous borrowers who claim they were misled into taking out mortgages they could not afford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the center of the controversy is an exotic but popular mortgage the Sandlers pioneered that helped generate billions of dollars of revenue at their bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Known as an option ARM -- and named ''Pick-A-Pay'' by World Savings -- it is now seen by an array of housing analysts and regulators as the Typhoid Mary of the mortgage industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pick-A-Pay allowed homeowners to make monthly mortgage payments that were so small they did not cover their interest charges. That meant the total principal owed would actually grow over time, not shrink as is normally the case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now held by an estimated two million homeowners, the option adjustable rate mortgage will be at the forefront of a further wave of homeowner distress that could greatly delay or even derail an economic recovery, mortgage industry analysts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Wachovia Corporation</span>, which bought the Sandlers' bank two years ago, was so battered by the souring portfolio of World Savings that it began writing off losses now projected at tens of billions of dollars and eventually stopped offering option ARMs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through it all, the Sandlers have maintained they did nothing wrong beyond misjudging the real estate bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I didn't mislead anybody, and to the best of my knowledge, our company didn't, though there may have been an isolated case here and there,'' Mr. Sandler said. ''If home prices hadn't declined by 50 percent, nobody would be raising these questions.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sandler also finds it incredible that borrowers feel victimized by Pick-A-Pay. ''All of a sudden their home is worth half of what it was, and they say they didn't know.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the Sandlers embraced practices like the use of independent brokers who used questionable methods to reel in borrowers. These and other practices, critics contend, undermined the conservative lending practices that the Sandlers built their reputations upon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This product is the most destructive financial weapon ever deployed against the American middle class,'' said William J. Purdy III, a housing lawyer in California who is representing elderly World Savings customers struggling to repay their loans. ''People who have this loan are now trapped, and they can't get another loan.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Birth of Pick-A-Pay</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marion Sandler, now 78, was a Wall Street analyst in the early 1960s when she and her husband decided to buy a bank that took only savings deposits and made mortgage loans -- a thrift, or savings and loan, in banking shorthand -- and run it themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sandler, now 77, was a lawyer in Manhattan who grew up poor on the Lower East Side, the son of a compulsive gambler whose earnings were consumed by loan sharks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Sandlers searched for a thrift in the sizzling California market and paid $3.8 million in 1963 for an Oakland enterprise called Golden West Savings and Loan Association, which later became the parent company of World Savings. It had a main office and one branch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Reagan era deregulation arrived, the Sandlers and two other competitors were able to market option ARMs for the first time in 1981. Before that, lawmakers balked at the loan because of its potential peril to borrowers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">World Savings initially attracted borrowers whose incomes fluctuated, like professionals with big year-end bonuses. In the recent housing boom, when World Savings started calling the loan Pick-A-Pay, they began marketing it to a much broader audience, including people with financial troubles, like deeply indebted blue-collar workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the entire thrift industry soared after deregulation, the Sandlers' business also took off. They avoided financial problems by doing things like scrutinizing borrowers' incomes to make sure loans were manageable and performing astute appraisals so the size of a mortgage was in line with the value of a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our protection was our total underwriting of the loan,'' Mr. Sandler said. ''From scratch.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When many of the Sandlers' competitors in the thrift industry later began collapsing under the weight of bad loans and investments, Congress and the media invited the couple to speak about the proper way to do business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The deregulatory situation attracted bums, charlatans, crooks, phonies, con men,'' Mr. Sandler told an ABC News program in 1990.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Sandlers also held onto World Savings' loans rather than selling them off to Wall Street to be repackaged as securities. They say this made them more alert to risky borrowers than were lenders who sold off their loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When foreclosures occurred, World Savings executives would drive to the house to see if they had made mistakes appraising the property or underwriting the loan. ''We called these the van tours,'' Mr. Sandler said. ''And we would say, 'O.K., have we done anything wrong here?' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More Philanthropic Work</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the Sandlers' wealth increased, so did their philanthropy. Over the years, they financed scientific research and groups like Human Rights Watch and the American Civil Liberties Union. More recently they founded and financed ProPublica, a nonprofit investigative journalism enterprise that has collaborated with The New York Times on coverage and a news archive. Its 14-member advisory board includes two top <span class="companylink">New York Times Company</span> editors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Sandlers' giving intersected most directly with their business interests in 2002 when they helped create an advocacy group for low-income borrowers called the Center for Responsible Lending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The center was the successor to a smaller organization in North Carolina, whose director, Martin Eakes, had helped the elderly and minorities avoid predatory banking practices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I said, 'Isn't that incredible what he is doing?' '' Mr. Sandler recalled. ''I said to Martin, 'What would it take to do what you do on a national scale?' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Eakes, who became the center's executive director, had also just helped secure a new mortgage lending law in North Carolina that prohibited, among other things, the use of prepayment penalties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I hated prepayment penalties,'' Mr. Eakes recalled, noting that such charges make it hard for cash-poor borrowers to refinance a loan for one with more manageable terms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Mr. Sandler supported the center's antipredatory goals, he disagreed with Mr. Eakes's position on prepayment penalties and sought to change his mind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sandler acknowledges that some lenders used the penalties to lock borrowers into ''absolutely awful'' loans. But he said his bank used the penalties to fend off unethical brokers who enticed borrowers with low-interest-rate loans that often had hidden fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You have to understand how independent brokers work,'' Mr. Sandler says. ''They are the whores of the world.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite that distaste, World Savings made extensive use of brokers. By 2006, they were generating some 60 percent of its loan business, he acknowledged. He said he was compelled to do so because of brokers were a dominant force in the mortgage industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a check on the representations that brokers made to borrowers, World Savings sought to telephone applicants to ensure that they understood the terms of their loan. These calls reached only about half of the borrowers, however, according to a former World Savings executive. Mr. Sandler did not dispute that point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Customer complaints that an unethical broker had misrepresented the terms of World Savings loans is at the heart of a lawsuit filed against the bank and others in Alameda County, Calif. The broker was sentenced to a year in prison for misleading at least 90 World Savings borrowers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sandler points out that the company was itself a victim of this broker, that it cooperated fully with authorities, and that it was not charged with any wrongdoing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others have also raised questions about how carefully World Savings disclosed lending terms to its borrowers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August, a federal judge in South Carolina ruled that World Savings had violated the federal Truth in Lending Act by telling borrowers that choosing to make minimum monthly payments on Pick-A-Pay mortgages might cause their principal to grow -- when in fact it certainly would occur.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Wachovia</span>, which is defending the case, has appealed the ruling. Mr. Sandler said he was not familiar with this lawsuit, but generally, he says, ''<span class="companylink">Wachovia</span>'s legal defense is deficient.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Speedy Merger</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By 2005, World Savings lending had started to slow, after more than quadrupling since 1998. The next year, <span class="companylink">Wachovia</span> bought the bank in a hastily arranged deal. The Sandlers say they sold their firm at the top of the market because they were growing older and wanted to devote themselves to philanthropy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some current and former <span class="companylink">Wachovia</span> officials say that the merger was agreed to in days and that it was impossible to conduct a thorough vetting of World Savings' loans. Others say the portfolio was adequately scrutinized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Herb and his wife had run a tight ship,'' said Robert Brown, a <span class="companylink">Wachovia</span> board member. ''There was not a huge concern about it because they had not had any delinquencies and foreclosures.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others were less sanguine. The creditworthiness of World Savings borrowers edged down from 2004 to 2006, according to <span class="companylink">Wachovia</span>'s data. Over all, Pick-A-Pay borrowers had credit scores well below the industry average for traditional loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't think anyone thought a Pick-A-Pay product was a customer friendly product,'' says a former <span class="companylink">Wachovia</span> executive who requested anonymity to preserve professional relationships. ''It is easy to mislead them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">World Savings lending volume dipped again in 2006 shortly after the sale to <span class="companylink">Wachovia</span> was initiated, according to the company's federal filings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This prompted World Savings to attract more borrowers by taking a step that some regulators were starting to frown upon, and which the company had been resisting for years: it allowed borrowers to make monthly payments based on an annual interest rate of just 1.5 percent. While World Savings continued to scrutinize borrowers' ability to manage increased payments, the move to rock-bottom rates lured customers whose financial reliability was harder to verify.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Russell W. Kettell, a former chief financial officer of World Savings, says the merger created ''pressure'' for ''a pretty good-sized increase in loan volume.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked if <span class="companylink">Wachovia</span> ordered World Savings to drop its rate, Mr. Kettell said, ''No, but they wanted volume and wanted growth.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A swift increase in option ARM lending had prompted federal regulators to weigh tougher controls on lending standards in 2005. Of the $238 billion in option ARM loans made nationally in 2005, World Savings issued about $52 billion, or more than one-fifth of the total.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Susan Schmidt Bies, a governor of the Federal Reserve System until last year, said the surge in volume in ARM lending caught regulators by surprise, and that she regrets not acting more quickly to protect borrowers because she believes that they could not understand the risky nature of option ARMs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When you get into people whose mortgage payments are taking half of their cash flow, they are in over their heads, and these loans should not have been sold to this customer base,'' she said. ''This makes me sick when I see this happening.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March 2006, two months before the <span class="companylink">Wachovia</span> deal, Mr. Sandler wrote regulators and objected to several aspects of the new rules, including the regulator's conclusion that option ARMS ''were untested in a stress environment.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He argued in the letter that World Savings had few loan losses in the recession of the early 1990s. Then again, the current financial crisis is far more severe than what occurred then -- far more severe than anything the country has faced since the Great Depression.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the third quarter of this year, <span class="companylink">Wachovia</span> was projecting $26.1 billion of losses on a World Savings loan portfolio worth a total of about $124 billion. About 6.2 percent of the Pick-A-Pay loans were more than 90 days late, it said, compared with an industry average of 8 percent on option ARMs and 1 percent on <span class="companylink">Wachovia</span>'s traditional loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>, which is now buying <span class="companylink">Wachovia</span>, is more pessimistic: it expects losses of $36 billion on the loans unless efforts to stem foreclosures help rescue part of the portfolio. The losses caused analysts and others to reassess the Sandlers' legacy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the ''Saturday Night Live'' skit, Paul Steiger, the former executive editor of The Wall Street Journal and the editor in chief of ProPublica, was among those who wrote to the show's producer, Lorne Michaels, saying the Sandlers had been unfairly vilified. Mr. Michaels apologized for the skit (which suggested that the Sandlers ''should be shot'') and removed it from NBC's Web site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sandler says <span class="companylink">Wachovia</span> did not work hard enough to help struggling borrowers, and that his loans became scapegoats for other problems at <span class="companylink">Wachovia</span>. He remains confident that losses on its loans will not reach <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>'s projections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He says World Savings was hit especially hard because it had made so many loans in volatile markets like inland California, but he disputes homeowner assertions that his option ARMs are at fault.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have not been able to identify one delinquency, much less a foreclosure, that is due to the product,'' Mr. Sandler said, adding that ''if home prices had not dropped, you wouldn't see'' a single article.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, analysts expect the option ARM fallout to be brutal. Fitch Ratings, a leading credit rating agency, recently reported that payments on nearly half of the $200 billion worth of option ARMs it tracks will jump 63 percent in the next two years -- causing mortgage delinquencies to rise sharply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sandler says that his loans are not in the pool that will become distressed in the next few years; he says they reset at a later date. He adds that were he not sure that the market would recover he would have sold his <span class="companylink">Wachovia</span> stock at the time of the takeover. His charity has sold off much of its <span class="companylink">Wachovia</span> stock, but he said he and his wife retain a substantial portion of their personal holdings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the Sandlers have their detractors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As the largest and most respected regulated institution providing option ARMs, I hold the Sandlers responsible because a large percentage of home borrowers -- but not all -- should have been advised that it was in their best interest to have a fixed-rate mortgage,'' said Robert Gnaizda, general counsel for the Greenlining Institute, a homeowner advocacy group. ''I believe that financial institutions have a quasi-fiduciary responsibility not to mislead the borrower.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sandler insists that World Savings prided itself on ethical conduct and that untoward behavior was never tolerated. ''We were also a family, and you expected people to live their personal and business lives in a particular way,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Reckoning: Articles in this series are exploring the causes of the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: January 6, 2009, Tuesday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A headline on Dec. 25 with an article about Herbert and Marion Sandler, bankers and philanthropists whose <span class="companylink">World Savings Bank</span> originated a type of adjustable-rate mortgage called Pick-a-Pay that has led to many foreclosures as the real estate market and the economy collapsed, described incorrectly the consequences to the Sandlers of the criminal and legal investigations of the practices of the bank, which they sold to <span class="companylink">Wachovia</span> in 2006. As the article noted, the Sandlers were once trusted mortgage pioneers and now face scrutiny, but they are not ''pariahs.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: January 16, 2009, Friday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Dec. 25 about Herbert and Marion Sandler, bankers and philanthropists whose <span class="companylink">World Savings Bank</span> pioneered a type of adjustable-rate mortgage called the Option ARM, referred imprecisely to their discussions on prepayment penalties with Martin Eakes, the chief executive officer of the Center for Responsible Lending, which the Sandlers helped found in 2002. During the housing boom, they were among those who persuaded Mr. Eakes of the acceptability of some proposed state regulations that would strictly limit, though not ban, prepayment penalties on the small fraction of prime mortgages that had them, including those from World Savings. Mr. Eakes and the Center for Responsible Lending have continued to oppose prepayment penalties generally, on both prime and sub-prime mortgages; Mr. Eakes did not ''drop his opposition.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: June 11, 2009, Thursday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Dec. 25, 2008, about Herbert and Marion Sandler, whose <span class="companylink">World Savings Bank</span> marketed adjustable-rate mortgages called option ARMs, referred imprecisely to a decision after the bank's sale to <span class="companylink">Wachovia</span> was initiated in 2006 to get more customers for such mortgages by lowering to 1 percent the interest rate borrowers would have to pay. World Savings reduced the rate then from 2.85 percent to 1.5 percent, but it was <span class="companylink">Wachovia</span> that lowered the rate to 1 percent, in 2007, according to data the Sandlers provided after the article was published.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The article also gave insufficient context for comments by Susan Schmidt Bies, a former Federal Reserve System governor, regretting that federal regulators had not imposed tougher controls on lending standards for option ARMs before the collapse in the real estate market that led to bank losses, foreclosures and recession. She was discussing option ARM lenders generally, not World Savings specifically.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales plunged last month, and housing prices fell at their fastest rate in 40 years, the latest indication that America's battered housing market will continue to struggle in a rapidly deteriorating economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes, which make up most of the market, declined 8.6 percent in November, to a seasonally adjusted rate of 4.49 million, according to the National Association of Realtors, a trade group. The median price of a home fell 13 percent in November, to $181,300 from $208,800 a year ago, its lowest point since February 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's probably the largest price drop since the Great Depression,'' said Lawrence Yun, chief economist of the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The troubles plaguing the housing market, which are at the heart of America's financial crisis, are only multiplying as the recession deepens and a spiral of rising unemployment, lower wages and economic uncertainty gathers force.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Housing dragged down the markets this summer,'' said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS Global Insight. ''Now it's the economy and financial markets that are dragging down housing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of single-family homes dropped 8 percent from October to November while the sales of condominiums and co-operatives fell even more, 13 percent, the Realtors association reported. Home sales declined across the country, but were the steepest in the Northeast, where they dropped 12 percent in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pool of unsold homes grew slightly to 4.2 million last month. At the current sales rate, it would take 11.2 months to sell the excess inventory, an increase from the 10.3 months of supply in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing values have plummeted since the peak of the market in July 2006, when the median home price hit $230,200. The median price in November was down 21 percent from the 2006 level as sales declined, credit dried up and a flood of foreclosed homes hit the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists expected home values to decline through the first six months of 2009. Joshua Shapiro, the chief United States economist at MFR, said some parts of the country might be only halfway through a retrenchment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Home sales haven't come down to prices that clear the market, given the size of the bubble that preceded this,'' Mr. Shapiro said. ''You need to have a correction, you need to have an adjustment.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve has tried to bolster housing by lowering its interest rate target to record lows and promising to buy billions of dollars of mortgage-backed debt. Mortgage rates have fallen as a result, but economists said that many buyers might not get back into the market until the rates on a 30-year fixed mortgage drop to 4.5 percent from the current 5.3 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department also reported Tuesday that new-home sales dropped to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 407,000 in November, from a downwardly revised rate of 419,000 in October. The median price of a new home sold in November was $220,400, down 11.5 percent from the period a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many homes that were sold were done so by owners forced to sell. Mr. Yun, the economist with the Realtors association, said that about 45 percent of all sales in November were distressed sales in which the sellers faced foreclosure or had to sell their homes for less than the value of the mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those sales were especially pronounced in regions hit hardest by the housing collapse. In parts of Southern California, more than half of all houses sold in November had gone through foreclosure at some point in the last 12 months, according to MDA <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span>, a real estate research firm. In the Las Vegas metropolitan area, that figure was 71 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Outside of distressed properties, the market is nonexistent almost,'' Frederick Cannon, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, said of the California market. ''You don't want to sell into it. Most people are saying, 'I'll just stay in this house.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A real estate agent in Riverside County in California, Gary Crutchley, said that he had sold six homes in the last four months. Three were foreclosure sales, two were ''short sales,'' in which homeowners sold to avoid foreclosure, and one was a traditional sale -- to a couple that had saved their money and were looking to buy into a distressed market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They're few and far between,'' Mr. Crutchley said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors who seemed to initially take Tuesday's economic news in stride sold late in the day. Stock markets closed lower ahead of a shortened trading session on Wednesday. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 100.28 points, or 1.2 percent, to 8,419.49, while the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index was down 8.47 points, or 0.97 percent, to 863.16. The Nasdaq composite index declined 10.81 points, to 1,521.54.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, the Commerce Department reported that the gross domestic product, the broadest measure of the economy, declined at an annual rate of 0.5 percent in the third quarter as corporate profits fell 1.2 percent. And the Reuters/University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment rose to 60.1 in December, up from 55.3 in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Treasury's 10-year note fell 15/32, to 113 31/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was unchanged at 2.17 percent.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EVEN in a sluggish real estate market, some buyers and sellers have been able to come to a meeting of the minds: all it takes is a seller with the stomach to slash the asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take the 19-foot-wide five-story brownstone at 123 West 85th Street. Although town houses on the West Side have sold for more than $15 million in recent years (and two are on the market for $25 million or more), this particular building, between Columbus and Amsterdam Avenues, was worth far less. It had been divided into nine apartments, needed extensive renovation and still had four apartments occupied by tenants protected by rent-stabilization laws.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But on the plus side, it has many fireplaces (nonworking), hardwood floors, tall windows and decorative molding throughout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the closing a few weeks ago, the investors who owned it said they had turned down offers of as much as $3.4 million in the past. When it went on the market last summer, however, as the economy sagged, they set a firm asking price of $3 million. But, said the listing broker, Dexter Guerrieri of Vandenberg, they found no takers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the sellers pressing to close on the transaction before year-end, they and Mr. Guerrieri agreed on the real estate equivalent of a Hail Mary pass, a price cut to $2.2 million, or more than 25 percent, if a buyer was able to close in just a few weeks. They were offering quite a buy: The next lowest asking price for a West Side town house is $3.1 million, on West 90th Street near Riverside Drive, according to Streeteasy.com. That building also has tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If buyers feel it is a compelling price, they will take out their checkbooks,'' Mr. Guerrieri said. ''The buyers came up in droves.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the two weeks before the cuts, the brokers did not have a single showing, he said. In the two weeks after, they showed the place nine times, and in the next two weeks, 19 times, before it went into contract on Nov. 14.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were 13 offers, most in those last two weeks. The eventual buyers turned out to be a real-estate-savvy investment adviser and his wife, who plan to restore the town house to its original layout and use it as a second home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property records list the buyer as George Bianco, a senior vice president and financial adviser at <span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span>, and his wife, Shirley Lindefjeld Bianco. They paid the asking price of $2.2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bianco said that until about 15 years ago, the couple rented in a building on West 86th almost directly behind their new house, but then moved to Westchester County. In the 1990s, when real estate was at a low, he said they bought a ''foreclosure home from a bank that was being liquidated'' and fixed it up. Later, they bought a 30-acre farm in Bedford, where they raise sheep and sell organic wool. Mr. Bianco said they would keep the farm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his view, real estate sales have slowed because sellers and buyers are confused about the value of real estate. ''Here the sellers were motivated to find out where the market was,'' he said. ''My personal opinion is that the real estate market, while it will be soft for a while, is a wonderful market long term.''</p>
