<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN the 1970s, when the Hunts Point section of the Bronx became associated with drugs, crime and prostitution, a group of bow-front row houses in the 800 block of Manida Street remained an oasis of tranquillity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, some residents of the block would like to ensure that the houses remain intact. They are thinking of seeking landmark status.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are about 40 of the homes, which were built around the turn of the last century, though the borough's historians have not determined an exact date. Semidetached two-families, they were built in a Flemish architectural style that would have been familiar to the Bronx's overwhelmingly Germanic population at the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The brick homes are a most unexpected gem in Hunts Point, a small peninsula separated from the rest of the South Bronx by the Bruckner Expressway. Properties there are mostly industrial buildings and low-income housing developments that in the last decades of the 20th century were plagued by arson and other problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When I first started doing walking tours in the 1970s,'' the architectural historian Barry Lewis said, ''there were two neighborhoods I wouldn't go into: Hunts Point and Red Hook. They were peninsulas, and you couldn't get out if a gang confronted you.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That sense of danger notwithstanding, the two-story row houses endured, and Mr. Lewis was pleasantly surprised to stumble upon them one day while visiting a nearby community group called the Point Community Development Corporation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Around the corner was this lovely row of town houses, some of them beautifully restored,'' he said. ''You would think you were in Park Slope.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residents of the block have long known they had something special, and a number of them take extra pride in their homes. Cybeale Ross bought her 2,792-square-foot home in 1958 for $16,500; she has preserved the high ceilings, French doors, bay windows, Gothic arches and stained-glass skylight, though she did turn a dumbwaiter shaft into a closet. She calls the 800 block of Manida Street a ''little oasis.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We never sold our home,'' Ms. Ross said. ''When the Bronx was burning, people were running like it was the plague. I said, 'No, I live in the Bronx, I work in the Bronx, the Bronx is my home.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other longtime residents include Jeannette Johnson, the wife of the Big Band-era bandleader Buddy Johnson, and Cynthia Phillips and Orrin Hercules, who describe the block in the '50s and '60s as one of elegance and refinement, populated by doctors, lawyers and musicians. Ms. Phillips, who bought her 2,624-square-foot home for $17,000 in 1961, said some of them had been modified a bit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Some of the owners made changes,'' she explained. ''The back entrance would be a bedroom in most of the houses, but the gentleman who owned my home prior to me made a kitchen at the back. Most of the homes have kitchens in the middle of the house.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hercules said he installed wooden paneling and drop ceilings in his home in the 1970s. He is now removing those elements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I guess at the time, people wanted to conserve heat,'' he said. ''But now I'm taking out the drop ceilings and paneling, and going back to the original walls, because these are beautiful structures. They all have French doors separating rooms, and upstairs have skylights, and there are patios in the back.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maria Torres bought her home in 2006, and said she knew of at least one person who bought a home on the 800 block of Manida Street more recently, hoping to restore it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Sidney A. Miller, a director of the Haven Heights Group in the Bronx, a real estate brokerage, values in the 800 block of Manida Street can be widely divergent, depending on how much historic detail remains in the home, whether the basement is finished or whether there is a garage. (In general, homes on the west side of Manida have garages; those on the east side do not.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the online real estate marketplace <span class="companylink">Zillow.com</span>, homes on Manida were valued as high as $533,000 at the residential real estate market's height in late 2008. Now they are closer to $370,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Torres, who moved to the neighborhood to work at the Point, said the Longwood Historic District was right on the other side of the Bruckner Expressway from Manida Street. ''This block probably should be landmarked,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lloyd Ultan, the Bronx borough historian, agreed, though he said finding historical data about the 800 block of Manida Street had not been easy. The homes were built around 1900 on subdivided estate or farmland at a time when the suburbs of New York City were being developed to alleviate congestion. At the time, the Bronx's largest population was of German ancestry, Mr. Ultan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The second-most-spoken language in the Bronx was German,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The homes may have been built by Henry Morgenthau Sr., a prolific Bronx real estate developer who also served as ambassador to the Ottoman Empire and was the grandfather of Robert M. Morgenthau, the longtime Manhattan district attorney. There is, however, no record of a direct tie to the elder Mr. Morgenthau, Mr. Ultan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bow-front homes on Manida Street may be the only example of this type of Flemish architecture in the entire city, similar in spirit but not identical to the Bertine Block Historic District on East 136th Street in the South Bronx, where the architecture is inspired by northern Germany, Mr. Ultan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are a lot of hidden treasures in these areas that most people think are devastated,'' he said. ''It's very difficult to get any real historic background, though. But I think there is a good claim for these homes to be landmarked.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FOR most home sellers, their ties to a property end at the closing. But for a few others the attachment can continue on for years, because they also assume the role of banker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seller financing, in which an owner offers a buyer a mortgage, was almost unheard of over the last decade, when money was cheap and lenders vied aggressively for borrowers with myriad mortgage products. But as lending conditions have since tightened drastically and the housing market has softened, seller financing is emerging as an option for both parties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The terms for these transactions may be different from what borrowers would find through conventional lenders, but real estate experts say they are otherwise straightforward. An owner typically agrees to transfer title to the home in exchange for a note and a security interest in the property. The note is paid off like a conventional mortgage, though to the seller instead of a bank. Closing costs may be slightly lower: there's no need for an appraisal, for instance, because the seller already knows a property's value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Walter Molony, a spokesman for the National Association of Realtors, said seller financing was common in the early '80s, when rates on the 30-year fixed mortgage rate topped 16 percent ''and conventional financing ground to a virtual standstill.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''After interest rates gradually declined it became less important,'' Mr. Molony said. ''But today it remains an important tool in higher-cost markets.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elise M. Barry, the chief executive of the Manhattan Association of Realtors and the Manhattan MLS Inc., says condominium developers, in particular, will sometimes offer financing to help sell the last units in a project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, prospective buyers typically cannot qualify for traditional financing unless 70 percent of the building is sold, if it's a new development, according to <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, the government-sponsored companies that set the underwriting rules for most mortgages. In some cases, <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> will waive that requirement, even with as few as half the units sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Albert Laboz, a principal of United American Land, a family-owned developer based in Manhattan, said that earlier this month he had begun offering five-year mortgages at 5.99 percent to buyers at SoHo Mews, a 68-unit development on West Broadway and Wooster Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Laboz said his building's units -- mostly two-bedrooms listed for about $2 million -- sold slowly last year. The units that did sell, he said, were all-cash transactions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Since we were under 50 percent sold, nobody could qualify for <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> or <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> financing,'' he said. ''And nobody else, really, was financing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At that point, Mr. Laboz said, his company sought the approval of its construction lender to offer loans to buyers who made down payments of at least 35 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 5.99 percent interest rate is competitive with those of so-called jumbo mortgages, defined as being above $729,750 in Manhattan. But Mr. Laboz conceded that the loan terms would discourage some borrowers: they would have to refinance the loan or pay it off fully within five years. But he said the loans were meant for those who could not obtain financing elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One buyer has qualified for this financing, he said, though the market has improved since his company started the financing program, and now more than half of the building is sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Laboz said he would still offer the loans, partly because the Fannie and Freddie mortgage limit of $729,750 may not be enough for prospective buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neil Garfinkel, a real estate lawyer in Manhattan, said more affluent borrowers like those buying at SoHo Mews might be more likely to refinance out of a five-year mortgage than someone buying at the lower end of the market with less room for error. ''If you're borrowing $200,000 and you're having trouble finding a loan today,'' he said, ''who knows where you'll be five years from now?''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IT was happenstance that brought Kevin Cheng to Astoria, Queens. A friend had an extra bedroom in his apartment, which was on the ground floor of an attached two-family row house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''So I moved into Astoria not knowing it was such a great neighborhood,'' said Mr. Cheng, who was born in Taiwan and raised in South Brunswick, N.J. ''And I completely fell in love with it and I stayed in the apartment even after my friend moved out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cheng was living there when he met Joanna Hong one weekend night. They brushed shoulders as they passed in the doorway of an East Village bar, and began dating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Hong, who was living with her family in Jamaica Estates, Queens, later moved in with Mr. Cheng. They married two and a half years ago and, with an eye toward starting a family, planned to leave the $1,200-a-month apartment once they found a home to buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple, now both 31, thought about the Long Island suburbs. But Mr. Cheng, who studied hotel and restaurant management at Raritan Valley Community College, didn't want to lengthen the commute to his job as cafe manager at the Reebok Sports Club on the Upper West Side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, ''my husband said there is no way he is going to maintain a house, it is a lot of work,'' said Ms. Hong, a graduate of Stony Brook University and now a paralegal at Bracewell &amp;Giuliani in Midtown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They briefly considered Manhattan but, in their price range of $500,000 or below, saw only very small places in co-op buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So it was easy to decide to remain in Astoria. They wanted enough space for a baby, at least for its first few years, in a fairly sizable new building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But they found few choices, as condominium buildings in Astoria tended to be small.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple bid about $500,000 on a two-bedroom of around 900 square feet at the Astoria Windsor, but found themselves less than excited about the place, which was far from the train.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Think about if it is a heavy snow day or if it is raining really hard, or if you go food shopping and have a lot to carry,'' Mr. Cheng said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They decided to keep looking. They then bid around $445,000 for a one-bedroom of just over 700 square feet in a nearby building called the Astoria. But as negotiations dragged on, they again found they weren't excited. This one, besides being far from the train, didn't seem roomy enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They had been eyeing Long Island City, south of Astoria. When they began their hunt about two years ago, ''there wasn't much development,'' Ms. Hong said, ''but they are slowly building.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They had dined in Long Island City, admired the view of Manhattan and visited the P. S. 1 Contemporary Art Center. Every time, they had had the same reaction: ''These places are really nice!'' Mr. Cheng exclaimed. And the many new condominiums gave them plenty of options.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was at this point that Ms. Hong's brother, Joel, became a factor in their search. Mr. Hong, 29, a graduate of St. John's University who works as a financial analyst in Midtown, lived at home but was looking for his own place. He had considered a one-bedroom co-op in Forest Hills, Queens, well located between his job and his parents' house. A few buildings there had the amenities he sought, including a gym, but ''I wasn't crazy about the apartments themselves,'' he said. Though he could afford around $500,000, prices there were much lower: $250,000 to $350,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The siblings' apartment search often became a weekend excursion for the Hong family, which includes their parents and a sister, Josephine, and her husband, who live in Woodside. ''We would have brunch together and look at different places and chat,'' Mr. Cheng said. When Mr. Hong saw the Long Island City waterfront, ''I instantly fell in love,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group made the rounds of the new condos in the area. ''Quite frankly, a lot of the one-bedrooms were kind of small relative to prices,'' Mr. Hong said. ''They were all sub-700 square feet. I didn't think it was worth it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their aim was to get the most space for the lowest price. By the time the group settled on the two finalists -- Hunters View and L Haus -- they knew they would be buying two apartments, coming in as a ''package deal,'' Mr. Hong said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We did a pro and con about the two buildings,'' Ms. Hong said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hunters View had a balcony, a great Manhattan view and floor-to-ceiling windows. L Haus, in an L shape with a landscaped yard, had beautiful kitchen and bathroom fixtures. But its rent-to-own program was problematic. ''As a home buyer,'' Ms. Hong said, ''I wouldn't want to buy a place where someone next door is renting.'' Negotiations there stalled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The winner was Hunters View. The group bought stacked units, one on top of the other. Each of the identical one-bedrooms cost about $420,000, with a monthly common charge of around $600.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They bought contiguous apartments, which gives them the ability to one day duplex it or sell it to someone looking to combine,'' said Patrick W. Smith, a senior vice president of Brown Harris Stevens and the condo's director of sales. (The building, which has 72 units, is 75 percent sold, he said.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each unit has more than 800 square feet, and a balcony of more than 100 square feet. The dining area can easily be sectioned off as a baby's room. Ms. Hong is happily decorating. ''Our furniture has been upgraded from Ikea to Crate and Barrel and West Elm and stuff like that,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hongs' mother, Mei Fung Hong, is glad the siblings are together. ''She said, 'I only have to visit you at one place rather than at two different places,' '' Ms. Hong said. ''We are there for each other, so she won't have to worry.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cheng, an expert cook, enjoys the new kitchen appliances and the open layout. ''I can cook while watching TV,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's Mr. Hong's life that has changed the most. ''I have a lot more time to do stuff,'' he said. After a long commute, ''you want to be lazy. But now I feel proactive. I go to the gym more often. Kevin and I play basketball.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He gets a major perk: ''I can't really cook at all,'' he said. So, almost every evening, ''I will run upstairs for dinner, chitchat, and just kind of hang out and watch TV.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE Columbia is a tall yellow-brick condominium at the corner of Broadway and West 96th Street, populated by many families and professionals. On weekday mornings, the lobby bustles with kids scurrying to school and grown-ups hurrying to work. Lately, though, there has been an addition to the hubbub: Contractors, lines of them, waiting for authorization to ascend the elevator to the apartments they are in the process of renovating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Men with tool belts used to be a common sight around condo and co-op buildings in a city that was renovation-mad. But when the economy collapsed and the real estate market tanked, the contractors, along with the carpenters, plumbers, electricians, floor guys and stone guys, seemed to fade away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now they're coming back. Across the five boroughs and beyond, the renovation business, which fell victim to tightening credit, declining home sales and overall economic misfortune, is starting to pick up. The increase reflects contradictory forces: a fitful but growing sense that the economy is getting better and, at the same time, more subdued ambitions for the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think a lot of it has to do with people having a longer-term perspective in their home now,'' said Doug Milles, a member of the condo board of the 300-unit Columbia. He added, ''I've always felt personally that it's a good time to invest in your property during down times, because when things get better, you're going to have a lot more attractive property.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contractors around the region say their phones are starting to ring again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've been swamped for the last month,'' said Constantine Rigas, the owner of Bullfrog Builders, which does work in New York City as well as Long Island and Westchester County. ''We're getting just a tremendous amount of people saying: 'I spoke to a friend six months ago and had been meaning to call you. I'm ready to do this now.' '' Business has been so promising for Rikk Davidson, the owner of As You Wish Interiors, a design and building company, that he is opening a showroom in Midtown Manhattan this spring. ''We are putting our money where our mouth is,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barry Goggin, the owner of the Barry Goggin Construction Corporation in Ronkonkoma, N.Y., is now booked about six months in advance for remodeling jobs, most of them on Long Island. A year ago, it was two months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's like there's been a pent-up demand,'' he said. ''People needed work done and maybe put it off until times got better.'' Mr. Goggin says he believes that many of the clients now upgrading or expanding their homes would simply have bought a bigger house several years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local statistics are hard to find. The New York City Buildings Department, for instance, is responsible for issuing building permits, but doesn't distinguish between projects done for commercial developers and for individual homeowners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, many home renovation projects don't require permits. (Those that do involve structural changes, like rearranging plumbing.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University, however, predicted in a recent report that the downturn in the home remodeling industry nationwide had hit bottom and that business would steadily increase through the rest of 2010. ''Housing prices in most markets of the country have bottomed out,'' said Kermit Baker, the director of the remodeling futures program at the Harvard center, which does policy research on housing markets. ''People are saying, 'Let's go ahead and do that project.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2004, during the frothy heyday of Manhattan real estate, Joe Laszlo bought the 475-square-foot apartment in Morningside Heights that he had been renting for five and a half years. The building was converting to a co-op, so he got an insider price. He expected, of course, that the market value of the apartment would climb (indeed soar, if the good times continued) and that several years later he would sell it and buy a bigger, nicer place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last spring, Mr. Laszlo realized that his plan probably wasn't going to work. So he is making his place more attractive. This means renovating the ''renter-grade'' kitchen (dated appliances, inefficient storage space, postage-stamp counter space) and bathroom (crummy fixtures, boring tile).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finding a contractor to do the job was no problem, since no one seemed to have much work. ''With one or two exceptions,'' he said, ''folks were interested in talking to me for what seemed like a relatively modest project.'' He got four or five bids and went with a midrange candidate; work began last fall. The renovation was supposed to be completed in eight weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, it took almost six months (total cost about $36,000). A few foul-ups contributed to the delay -- like the countertop that took weeks to create, and then fell and smashed to pieces the day it was to be delivered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the contractor's office got busier. Mr. Laszlo felt as if he had ''undivided attention when I started the project,'' he said. ''By the time I reached the midpoint, it felt like it was divided. That was good for them. Not so good for me.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though contractors are again in demand, they have far to go to get back to their boom years, which means homeowners can still get a good deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sheri Whitley estimates that by doing renovation work now instead of a few years ago, she and her husband, Mark van Dok, are saving about $10,000. The owners of a co-op in a 19th-century building on Adam Clayton Powell Boulevard, they are having a parlor converted to a master bedroom, and replacing windows and floors in a second bedroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They bought the apartment for a steal during the height of the boom because the owner had to sell quickly. For a variety of reasons, including a newborn baby, they put off major renovation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Before, we had thought we would strip the woodwork ourselves,'' Ms. Whitley said. But with prices more reasonable now, ''we said, let's just hire someone to do it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some renovation projects amount to the extra steps necessary to sell the place in today's uncertain market. Jordan Lippner recently listed his two-bedroom prewar co-op on West 78th Street for $1.595 million, but only after he replaced the floors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he bought the apartment four years ago, he renovated it, adding built-in bookshelves and installing top-of-the-line appliances (Viking range, Thermador double oven, Bosch dishwasher). But by the time it came to the floors, he'd run out of money. He hid the chipped and worn planks under area rugs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he decided to sell, his agent, Joyce Bernstein of Prudential Douglas Elliman, advised him that new floors were worth the expense -- and the inconvenience. A few years ago, she said, she would have told him the opposite.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'd have said, 'People will pay up and fix the floors themselves.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in today's market, ''you really have to give something special to get the money you want,'' she said, adding, ''The rest of the apartment was in such mint condition, the floors would have been the first thing the buyer would notice and want to cut the price.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lippner got her point. ''If I was going to spend over a million and a half dollars on an apartment,'' he said, ''I wouldn't want to see floors looking like they were 50 years old and crumbling.'' The new ones cost $13,000 and are Brazilian oak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like prospective buyers, however, prospective renovators may still find their visions tempered by financing hurdles. In previous years, owners used home-equity loans and home-equity lines of credit to finance lavish remodeling projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Theproblem with getting one today is not the interest rates: a revolving home-equity line of credit is relatively cheap. (The average rate was 5.52 percent in February 2010, compared with 8.70 percent in February 2007, according to Keith Gumbinger, a vice president of HSH.com, a mortgage analysis and financial publishing firm. The average rate on a fixed-rate home-equity loan was 7.86 percent in February, compared with 8.09 percent in February 2007.) But banks and other lenders have tightened their standards, and home-equity financing is harder to get.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, many people are paying cash. That's what Mr. Lippner and Ms. Whitley and Mr. Van Dok did. So, too, are Susan and John Gramas, a retired couple who hired Mr. Davidson of As You Wish Interiors to do extensive renovations on their semiattached 1930 house in Bayside, Queens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First came the bathroom. They deep-sixed the tub, installed a shower with a granite bench, and redid the floors and wall with glass tile in shades of brown and beige.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then came the kitchen -- an objectionable space, Mrs. Gramas said, with pink and gray Formica. The new space has been reconfigured, and has granite countertops (beige with gray and green flecks), glass tiles, cherry cabinets and a stainless-steel Viking refrigerator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now to the basement. They have upgraded the electricity and are redoing a bathroom and laundry room, as well as creating a special space for their cats and their litter boxes. Mrs. Gramas says they have spent about $120,000 on the renovations and are thrilled.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A small asphalt lot fills a nondescript corner of Chelsea, visually bland, wrapped in iron fencing and carpeted with a couple dozen cars. The only thing remarkable about it is that it exists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lot provides cheap parking for tenants in the adjoining public housing development, the Elliott-Chelsea Houses, an unlikely perk in a neighborhood synonymous with the trappings and traps of success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the lot's valiant fight against the physics of real estate and government finance is about to come to an end. The city Housing Authority is selling it to a developer for $4 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sale is part of a sweeping citywide plan to shoehorn up to 6,000 homes affordable to low- and moderate-income families, along with some shops, into parcels of public housing property deemed ''underutilized'' -- mostly open spaces and parking lots. Set in motion in 2006, the plan is now hitting its stride, with 3,500 units either finished or in the pipeline, including four projects completed and another eight under way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The initiative is rooted in practical needs and grander hopes for the future of public housing. The new construction will help Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg reach his goal of preserving or creating 165,000 affordable units by 2014. It will also generate money for the cash-poor Housing Authority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With their parking lots, greenery and open space, the city's housing complexes were often ''under-built to what zoning would allow,'' said Ilene Popkin, the authority's assistant deputy general manager. Ms. Popkin said her goal was ''to identify where the opportunities are for affordable housing development that makes sense.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sold-off parking lots will be replaced with new lots nearby, Ms. Popkin said. ''No one lost a parking spot as a result of what we did,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, there is, not surprisingly, some resentment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until recently, Duwain Boyce, 18, who lives at Stapleton Houses, on the north shore of Staten Island, had a million-dollar view: the stalagmites of Lower Manhattan rising across the harbor, dingily framed by his bedroom window. He now gazes upon a building for low-income older people, under construction on a former parking lot and set to be eight stories tall when it opens later this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It makes me feel claustrophobic,'' Mr. Boyce said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His mother added wryly that bringing elderly people into public housing might make them obvious targets for criminals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prospect of losing public housing land, and to tenants paying higher rents in many cases, has fanned fears that the authority wants to edge out its residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Elliott-Chelsea, the new units on the site of the current parking lot, at Ninth Avenue and West 25th Street, will be open to households with annual incomes of up to $150,000 for a family of four. Assurances that lost parking spaces will be offset by spaces in a garage beneath the new building have done little to temper existing tenants' misgivings. Rumors flew -- all false -- that the new units would be million-dollar apartments built by Donald J. Trump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's going to be too crowded, and this project is falling down around us,'' said Karen Hodges, 52, who has lived at Elliott-Chelsea for two decades. ''Sweetheart, they took a lock off my door and told me I had to wait until August to get it fixed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But at Stapleton, the new building has also lit a sense of hope. Perhaps it will ease the stigma the development carries, some tenants said. Perhaps it will even tamp down crime.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a great idea,'' said Steven Nelson, a 39-year-old welder. ''Maybe with a lot of older people in the neighborhood, some of the younger loose cannons will slow down in their activities.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Geraldine Parker, president of the Stapleton tenants association, said several tenants hoped to move into the new building -- open to people 55 and older -- ''to get away from young people and blasting music.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I wish I was old enough to get in there,'' added Mrs. Parker, who is in her 40s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Popkin, the authority official, said the new developments, planned in concert with the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, were expected to bring in $75 million -- money that could be used to fix up existing buildings -- through sales of the sites and long-term ground leases to private developers that construct and own the buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new construction also dovetails with the authority's efforts to refashion its original blueprint, modeled on the Le Corbusier vision of ''towers in the park,'' or soaring residential fortresses set in vast moats of green. Underpinning that vision, said Nicholas D. Bloom, author of ''Public Housing That Worked: New York in the Twentieth Century,'' was the belief that ''if you put people in sanitary good housing, with air and modern facilities, all the problems of the slums would end.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the towers instead isolated residents from the thrum of the city streets, and critics decried some open expanses as too vast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Kelly, the Housing Authority's general manager, said that along with the new construction, the agency was looking to reopen streets to integrate developments into the ''tapestry of the surrounding neighborhood.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bloom said the success of the new program hinged on how thoughtfully it was executed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It all comes down to design,'' he said, ''and if they're able to add new housing without destroying the nice qualities -- apartments that have light and air and nice views.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Soundview Houses in the Bronx, where the green spaces are as big as city blocks and sown with gracious trees, three new buildings are planned for a boomerang-shape plot stretching between the development and the Bronx River, with a fourth set for a patch of land that now has picnic tables and barbecues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mary McGee, the tenants association president there, said residents were worried about asthma aggravated by construction, and more overcrowding of buses, community centers and schools. ''They have to consider the people who are living here,'' Ms. McGee said. ''These people are going to come in and start utilizing what we have, and we don't have anything.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Elliott-Chelsea Houses, the parking lot brought in only $1,396 in parking fees last year. But residents described it as more than the sum of its 42 spaces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a buffer in an increasingly alien neighborhood filling up with high-end galleries, club-land debauchery, and multimillion-dollar glass lofts. Which is why people like Phyllis Gonzalez, the tenants association president, say there is reason to fear the 168-unit tower planned for the site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are blessed to be here; we know that,'' Ms. Gonzalez said. ''But it's getting tighter and tighter, and we're going to have a big building in our face.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A picture caption last Thursday with an article about hiring fitness trainers for home workouts referred imprecisely to the people shown. Amber O'Neal, the trainer, is at the right, next to Kristen Leigh, her client; the words ''at left'' referred to the picture's position in relation to the caption.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Thu Apr 01 2010</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHEN Laurie Davis wakes up in the morning, she sometimes feels like skipping her workout. But two days a week, hitting the snooze button is not an option: she knows that at 7 a.m., Yvette Rose will ring the buzzer at her Manhattan apartment with hand weights and resistance bands in tow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Even when you don't want to get up and put your workout clothes on, there's just no excuse,'' said Ms. Davis, an account executive at a New York advertising agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many people find that hiring a personal trainer who makes house calls is the only way to ensure they stick to their fitness goals. Although it may sound like a luxury, training at home has grown more affordable since the economy soured because more instructors are willing to strike deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are plusses and minuses to an at-home workout. For the client, training in the living room means giving up commercial-gym amenities -- spinning rooms, saunas, the latest elliptical machine -- in exchange for privacy, convenience and, most important, an iron-clad appointment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the trainer, making house calls means not having to split fees with a gym or invest in a lot of equipment. On the down side, it can mean having to lug heavy weights and operate in spaces that may not be ideal for a vigorous workout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Every time you go in, you have to scout around and make sure there isn't stuff lying around or that the floors aren't sticky,'' Ms. Rose said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Children and dogs can also be a problem. ''I've taught yoga classes where the client will be in a plank position, and her son jumps on her back,'' she added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the price for at-home training is usually about the same as for meeting a trainer at a gym -- in the New York area, it usually costs $75 to $225 an hour -- many personal trainers and yoga and Pilates instructors are hungry for work, so it is a buyer's market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Liz Neporent, president of Wellness 360, which manages residential gyms in co-ops and condominiums, said that since the downturn she has seen a sharp increase in the number of highly qualified trainers asking to get on Wellness 360's payroll, which offers steadier work but lower hourly pay than independent contracting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It used to be like pulling teeth to get them to come,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many private trainers do not want to admit that they will lower their rates, but some clients are quietly passing on the word. Karen Hochman, editorial director of TheNibble.com, an online food magazine, said that her Pilates teacher gives her a half-price discount. Without it, she said, she would not be able to afford twice-a-week lessons in her Manhattan apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm grateful the recession has provided me with this opportunity, though I wish I could pay my teacher more,'' Ms. Hochman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Andrea Albicocco, meeting a personal trainer at the gym in her condominium in Hoboken, N.J., helped her get in shape for her wedding last fall. ''I'm the kind of person who doesn't push myself at the gym,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though Mrs. Albicocco had previously worked with trainers at a fitness club, she found the setting too public. ''I didn't like the way people were watching me,'' she said. ''You feel self-conscious while the trainer is showing you how to do it and pushing you.'' At her home gym, she was able to negotiate a rate of $65 an hour -- down from $75 -- by paying for 25 sessions up front, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some people are able to afford at-home training by teaming up with a friend to share the cost. ''Trainers are realizing that they may not be able to charge their regular fee of $80 an hour for a solo session, but they can charge two people $50 an hour and train them together,'' said Neal Pire, a personal trainer from Ridgewood, N.J. ''So they are charging less per person, but they are also making more money.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are challenges. Safety is an issue, which is why Amber O'Neal, who owns a fitness company in Atlanta called Cafe Physique, never sends a female trainer to a male client unless his wife is also a client and is home during the session. Ms. O'Neal focuses exclusively on sending trainers to people's homes -- she had owned a workout studio, but the weak economy prompted her to close it -- and said she often fields calls from men requesting female instructors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The more they insist, the more suspicious she becomes. ''There are times when you can tell that something is not right,'' Ms. O'Neal said. Cafe Physique also reserves the right to cancel a session at any time, and trainers are told they may abort a session if, for any reason, they feel threatened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, students and trainees must also be mindful of whom they let into their homes, so Ms. O'Neal also runs background checks for all the trainers she hires.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For those considering individual trainers, Mr. Pire recommends interviewing several candidates and getting referrals from their clients. ''Ask them, 'Did you ever feel uncomfortable having them over?' '' he said. ''They'll be honest with you. People are surprisingly forthcoming.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Neporent says that the trainer should also have liability insurance and certification from a well-known accrediting agency, like the American College of Sports Medicine, the National Strength and Conditioning Association or the Yoga Alliance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At-home training can undermine an instructor's authority, some instructors say. Jonathan FitzGordon, a yoga instructor in Brooklyn, said he preferred meeting with clients in a rented studio space than their homes, though it costs him more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When you bring me into your home and you're paying me, I'm more like a servant,'' he said. ''I don't play that role when you come to me.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. O'Neal said that some clients want to watch television while working out. Her personal trainers can usually roll with it, she said, since many of them are high-energy multitaskers themselves. ''They'll say: 'Oh, you're watching ''The Tyra Banks Show.'' O.K., here's what we did last week,' '' Ms. O'Neal said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, the gym has distractions, too. When Mrs. Albicocco was working with a trainer at her local gym, she said that she did not always have his full attention. ''I'd be in the middle of a training session, and people would be walking up and talking to him, and I'd think, 'Hey, I'm paying all this money -- talk to me.' ''</p>

</div><div class="author">By DAVID STREITFELD </div><div>707 words</div><div>24 March 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>9</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The volume of home sales is slumping even as the number of properties on the market is rising, which is putting new pressure on prices, according to economic data released Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The triple whammy of bad news stoked fears that the brief recovery in housing was finished and another dip had begun. If that proves to be the case, it could slow the broader economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The housing market may remain a noose around the neck of the U.S. economy for some time yet,'' Paul Dales of Capital Economics told clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates are near their postwar low, and the government is offering buyers a tax credit of as much as $8,000 if they will do a deal now. But the appeal of both inducements has proved faint this winter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes fell 0.6 percent in February from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.02 million units, the National Association of Realtorssaid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop, which was roughly in line with analysts' predictions, came after a sharp decline in December and a more modest one in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This winter has been brutal,'' said Michael E. Menatian, president of the Sanborn Mortgage Corporation of West Hartford, Conn. ''People were hunkered down, worried that things were going to get worse and petrified to make a big move.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors' association cited the winter weather as a reason for some of February's lackluster results, although sales were actually strongest in the storm-plagued Northeast and Midwest and weakest in the West. The South was down slightly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales volume has retraced about two-thirds of its upward swing since last spring, said Sal Guatieri of BMO Capital Markets Economics. Volume is only 7 percent above the level of February 2009, when many buyers expected the recession to develop into a depression.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only positive thing to say about February, Mr. Guatieri wrote in a research note, ''is that the rate of decline has slowed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A smaller pool of buyers inevitably means that sellers have to settle for less. Home prices in January fell 0.6 percent from the previous month, the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> said in a separate report. The decline in December was revised downward to a 2 percent drop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal index is now at a new low for this housing cycle, and roughly at the same value it had in the fall of 2004. The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span> Case-Shiller Home Price Index, which uses a different set of data, is still modestly above its lows of last spring. The Case-Shiller numbers for January will be released next week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the market has truly turned down again, the respite was brief. After three years of declines, both sales and prices began stabilizing last year. One major reason was the tax credit. Originally due to expire Nov. 30, the credit sparked a mini-frenzy as buyers struggled to strike deals before the deadline. Congress then extended and broadened the credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many agents, lenders and brokers expect sales to pick up again, at least temporarily, as the credit's new deadline of April 30 approaches. ''Things are starting to loosen up,'' said Mr. Menatian of Sanborn Mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More sellers are putting their homes on the market, doubtless hoping to lure buyers eager to take advantage of the tax credit. At the current sales rate, it would take 8.6 months for all homes on the market to find buyers, up from 7.8 months in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A normal market has about six months of inventory. In 2008, the level hit a modern peak of over 11 months. If the many homes in the process of foreclosure make their way to market in the next few months, inventory levels could jump again, putting renewed pressure on prices.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAVE CREEK, Ariz. -- The uncertain line between hope and despair divides this exurb of Phoenix, where the trim stucco houses used to sell so briskly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It winds around the swimming pools and the pebbled yards of East Montgomery Road like a slow-burning fuse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On one side are people like the Setbackens, Gary and Cissie, who moved here from Washington State and, with prudence, have managed to pay their mortgage bill month after month. On the other side are those like Kelley Carter, who never dreamed that home prices would fall so hard, and got in over their heads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two in five homeowners in this sprawling development 30 miles northeast of Phoenix are underwater on their mortgages. And that reality is wearing away household budgets and people's patience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Arizona is one of five states that, with money from Washington, hopes to help at least some of these people hold on to their homes. Under a new, federally financed pilot program for the hardest-hit housing markets, state officials will decide who will get a homeowner bailout, and who will not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea is as controversial in Washington as it is here. Do the neighbors next door who lived beyond their means -- the ones who, say, bought that house they could not afford, or who binged on home equity loans to buy new cars and flat-panel TVs -- really deserve to be bailed out with taxpayer dollars? Do they deserve to have some of their debts forgiven? And is that fair to the cautious ones who paid their mortgages?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the people of Cave Creek, the answers will fall to state officials like Michael Trailor, the director of the Arizona housing department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A former real estate developer, Mr. Trailor knows firsthand about the perils of the property market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I feel for all of them,'' Mr. Trailor said of the struggling homeowners. ''But we do not have the funds to help all of them. If we can help 6,000 people, which ones should we help?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government will pay for pilot programs in Arizona, California, Florida, Michigan and Nevada with $1.5 billion from the federal banking rescue. That figure is a small fraction of the funds that would be needed to help all of the people at risk. Arizona, for instance, received $125 million. If it allocates $30,000 of aid for each residence, 4,166 homeowners would benefit. But the Phoenix area is bracing for as many as 50,000 foreclosures this year alone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trailor said he was reluctant to help homeowners with ''self-inflicted wounds,'' like those who overspent or cashed out the equity in their homes during the bubble years. He wants the banks to match the public money being used for debt forgiveness, and he is focusing on people whose incomes have fallen but who still hold jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is considering an approach known as ''earned forgiveness,'' where the state and the banks promise to forgive mortgage debt later on, but only if the homeowners stay in their homes and keep making their payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question of who deserves help rouses neighbors here. Not long ago, home values seemed to reach relentlessly toward the bright blue sky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then the boom went bust. Home prices in the Phoenix area have collapsed by 50 percent since mid-2006, leaving many owners with mortgages that are higher than their property values. One in 10 homes in this development in Cave Creek have moved through foreclosure since 2008, according to Netvaluecentral, a real estate tracking company in Glendale, Ariz. Half of the homes here are owned by banks or are being sold for less than the value of their mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Underwater homes make it highly likely people will walk away, and if they do, these foreclosures are going to push everyone's prices down,'' said Brett Barry, a real estate agent here. ''People need to realize that we're in this together.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new reality is evident on East Montgomery Road, where the bust is playing out in a variety of ways.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are the Setbackens, at 4355, who arrived in 1993 and paid down their mortgage even as home prices skyrocketed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the street are the Chatburns, Tim and Leslie. They also arrived in the 1990s, before prices exploded, but struggled recently to keep up with the bills after an injury kept Mr. Chatburn out of work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Chatburn, an air-conditioning repairman, used to say that bailing out his neighbors would be unfair, but he changed his mind after watching news programs about the rescues of big financial companies like the <span class="companylink">American International Group</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I started thinking about all this money we paid as taxpayers to the banks,'' he said, ''and I thought, 'Why don't we take care of our own a little bit?' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Carter, at 4344, arrived in 2005, as the bubble was inflating. She took out tens of thousands of dollars in home equity for repairs and other items, and by this year, she was underwater on her mortgage by $86,000. A single mother, she moved out this month, days before her home was sold in a short sale, which meant her mortgage lender allowed her to sell for less than the value of her mortgage and the lender took the loss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then there is the young couple with a toddler, at 4343. They moved out on the same day as Ms. Carter, before a scheduled foreclosure of their home that was $115,000 underwater. The couple, who asked not to be named, also bought near the peak and took out a home equity loan to pay off their student loans and other debts. Then, a year ago, they stopped paying their mortgage, after both of them lost their jobs for a time. They now have office jobs again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Setbacken, a salesman, said he had warned his neighbors not to get in over their heads but they did not listen. He and his wife might have stepped up to a bigger house if they, like so many of their neighbors, had gambled recklessly on the housing market, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everybody that I know that got themselves in trouble was because of one word: greed,'' said Mr. Setbacken, 63, a former Marine who remains in tip-top physical condition. ''I have no sympathy for any of them, on the financial end. When I hear about dropping the amount you actually owe, I could stick my finger down my throat.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then the doorbell rang. It was a young girl bearing Girl Scout cookies. ''My adopted granddaughter,'' Mr. Setbacken announced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 8-year-old is Ms. Carter's daughter, Ava. Across the street, Ms. Carter was packing up the house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Carter said she felt guilty about leaving. With her short sale, the price of the home went down to the benefit of the new homeowner. But it dragged down prices in the neighborhood, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Carter, a mother of two and a real estate agent who poses as an angel with wings on her Web site, has been through hard times before. Years ago, she considered filing for bankruptcy but then changed her mind. She said she was accountable for her actions and was making what amounted to a business decision to leave her home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I had to take emotion out of it,'' said Ms. Carter, 36. ''If I had a business, and every single month I was losing money, would I keep on paying? No, I wouldn't.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sitting at her dining room table, before a large tank of fish, she recalled how she had made this a perfect home. It is one of the few on East Montgomery Road with grass in the yard, an expensive proposition in the desert. A Mercedes sits in the driveway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said she did not feel she deserved to have her debts forgiven, but added that if her mortgage had been lowered, she would have tried harder to stay. The worst part, she said, is that her decision will hurt Mr. Setbacken, who has watched out for her over the years. ''For Gary, he's going to have to deal with the ramificationsof what I'm doing because I'm bringing his property value down,'' she said. ''I pray at church. I feel horrible for what I'm doing to my neighbors.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later, after Mr. Setbacken talked to Ms. Carter -- she ''cried and cried and cried,'' he said -- he had a change of heart. In an e-mail message, he said that perhaps wealthy Americans could donate money to aid homeowners. If he had more money himself, he might help some neighbors pay their mortgage bills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have focused on the financial issues during these times and overlooked what was more important, the emotional stress that my neighbors are feeling,'' Mr. Setbacken wrote. He walked down East Montgomery Road and gave a bottle of wine to the young couple facing foreclosure. It was, he said, ''to help them pack.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BOSTON -- Jane Petion lived in her home for 15 years and saw its value rise slowly, rise rapidly and, when the housing bubble burst, plunge at a sickening pace that left her owing $400,000 on a house worth closer to $250,000. Last June, her lender foreclosed on the property. The family received notices of eviction and appeared in housing court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then they discovered a surprising paradox within the nation's housing crisis: Their power to negotiate began after foreclosure, rather than ending there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December Ms. Petion signed a new mortgage on her house for $250,000, with monthly payments of less than half the previous level. She and her husband now have a mortgage they can afford in a neighborhood that benefits from the stability they provide. A nonprofit lender made the deal possible by buying the house from her original mortgage company and selling it to her for 25 percent more than its purchase price -- a gain to hedge against future defaults.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was exactly what we needed to get back on our feet,'' said Ms. Petion, who works for a state agency. ''We have income. But another bank, it would have been easy to look at our foreclosure and say, 'I'm sorry, we have nothing for you now.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This counterintuitive solution -- intervening after foreclosure rather than before -- is the brainchild of Boston Community Capital, a nonprofit community development financial institution, and a housing advocacy group called City Life/Vida Urbana, working with law students and professors at Harvard Law School.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the program, which started last fall, is small so far, there is no reason it cannot be replicated around the country, especially in areas that have had huge spikes in housing prices, said Patricia Hanratty of Boston Community Capital. ''If what you've got is a real estate market that went nuts and a mortgage market that went nuts, what you've got is an opportunity.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two years into the nation's housing meltdown, and after hundreds of billions of dollars of federal rescue programs, government officials and housing advocates denounce the unwillingness of lenders to adjust the balances on homes that are worth less than the mortgage owed on them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Research suggests that such disparity, rather than exotic interest rates, is the main driver of foreclosures, in tandem with a job loss or another financial setback. The financial industry lobbied aggressively to defeat legislation that would empower bankruptcy judges to adjust mortgage balances to properties' market value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That reluctance, however, eases after foreclosure, when lenders find themselves holding properties they need to unload, Ms. Hanratty said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We found, frankly, the industry wasn't ready to do much pre-foreclosure,'' she said. ''But once it was either on the cusp of foreclosure or had been taken into the bank portfolio, banks really do not want to hold on to these properties because they don't know how to manage them, don't know what to do with them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Working with borrowed money, Boston Community Capital buys homes after foreclosure and sells or rents them to their previous owners, providing new mortgages and counseling to the owners, who typically have ruined credit. During the process the families remain in their homes. Since late fall it has completed or nearly completed deals on 50 homes, with an additional 20 in progress, Ms. Hanratty said. The organization is now trying to raise $50 million to expand the program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steve Meacham, an organizer at City Life/Vida Urbana, is one reason banks may be willing to sell their foreclosed properties to Boston Community Capital. When families receive eviction notices, his group holds demonstrations or blockades outside the properties, calling on lenders to sell at market value. It also connects the residents with the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau, whose students work to pressure lenders to sell rather than evict by prolonging eviction and ''driving up litigation costs,'' said Dave Grossman, the clinic's director.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''So they're being defended legally, and we're ramping up the pressure publicity-wise,'' Mr. Meacham said. ''And B.C.C. came in; they had a part that buys properties and a part that writes mortgages. It wouldn't work without all three.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A focus of the program has been the working-class neighborhood of Dorchester, where home prices dropped 40 percent between 2005 and 2007, compared with a 20 percent drop statewide, according to research by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. Foreclosures and delinquencies there are more than twice the state average, the bank found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In such neighborhoods, lenders and residents are hurt by evictions, which often leave vacant properties that invite crime and drive down values of neighboring houses, Ms. Hanratty said. ''So it's in the lenders' interest to get fair market value as quickly as possible, and in the interest of the community to have as little displacement as possible.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The program is not a solution for all lenders or distressed homeowners. After months of post-foreclosure negotiations with her bank, Ursula Humes, a transit police detective, is waiting for her final 48-hour eviction notice. Her belongings are in boxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Humes owed $440,000 on her home; her lender offered to sell it to Boston Community Capital for $260,000. But after assessing Mrs. Hume's finances, the nonprofit asked for a lower selling price, and the lender refused.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a recent evening, Mr. Grossman of the Harvard law clinic counseled Mrs. Humes on her options. ''This is a case that doesn't have a happy ending,'' Mr. Grossman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Humes said, ''I depleted my retirement account and everything I owned, but I'm still going to lose it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many commercial lenders, similarly, would shy away from such a program because it involves writing mortgages for borrowers who have already defaulted once -- a high risk for a small reward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For other homeowners, though, the program is a rescue at the last possible second. Roberto Velasquez, a building contractor, lost his home to foreclosure last November, owing the lender $550,000. After extensive wrangling, during which his family stayed in the house, he bought it again in March for $280,000, a price he can afford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the night after he closed, he joined other members of City Life/Vida Urbana at a foreclosed four-unit building in Dorchester from which most of the tenants had been evicted. A group of artists projected videos on sheets in the windows, showing silhouettes of families re-enacting their last 72 hours before eviction. Garbage filled one of the units. Mr. Velasquez said it hurt to stand amid such loss, but he was jubilant at his own perseverance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've been fighting for so long,'' he said, ''and we win, because we're still in the house.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CLOSE your eyes and picture your dream apartment. Do you see light streaming through big open windows? Is there a large kitchen? Nice prewar detail?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now open your eyes and remember that you are in New York City -- an extraordinarily expensive place to live, recession or no recession. So, what would you sacrifice to get a great place?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many people, the answer can be summed up in one little word: elevator. If you are willing and able to climb the stairs to the fourth or fifth floor of one of New York City's 147,500 walk-ups, you may be rewarded with a little something extra at the top, like a better price, some private outdoor space or a great view.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I grew up in Europe where there are lots of old buildings, so the stairs are natural,'' said Stephan Wessels, who lives on the fifth floor of a walk-up building with his wife, Elinor, and baby daughter, Juliana. ''I like the light, I like the fact that it's open, I like that nobody is on top of me making noise.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, Mr. and Mrs. Wessels are trying to sell their Upper East Side apartment. Not to shed those four flights of stairs, he says, but because they want a second bedroom. Their child's crib is now in the hall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Fresh Direct delivers all the way up,'' Mr. Wessels said. ''That's a good thing to bear in mind.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their apartment, No. 5W at 334 East 83rd Street, has 700 square feet, with good light and a decorative fireplace. It's listed at $400,000, a lower price than comparable apartments nearby that do not require a climb. Last week, a similarly sized one-bedroom in an elevator building a few blocks away had an asking price of $445,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Normally in a building that's not a walk-up, the higher you go, the more expensive it is,'' said Philip Horigan, the Corcoran broker with the listing on the Wessels property. ''But in a walk-up, the more you walk up, the cheaper it is. But you still get more light and more square footage.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to shaving money off the purchase price, a daunting set of stairs might also save an owner money on the monthly maintenance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a smaller segment of the market that's willing to walk four flights or more,'' said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel and a partner in Condominium Recovery, which invests in real estate. ''Most of these buildings are co-ops, and the share allocations are smaller as you go up because the value diminishes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a soft market like this one, buyers are often unwilling to make sacrifices. So a drawback -- a location in neighborhoods politely referred to as ''emerging,'' say, or the lack of an elevator -- can be an even bigger-than-usual drag on the price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We couldn't believe what we got for the money,'' said Wendy Lichtenberg, a broker at Prudential Douglas Elliman whose stepdaughter just bought a large one-bedroom in a fifth-floor walk-up on the Upper East Side for under $600,000. ''Up 56 stairs to the Enchanted Egg,'' as we call it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's her stairway to heaven,'' Ms. Lichtenberg added. ''Though honestly, at my age, would I want to walk up all those stairs? No, I would not.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For young buyers, hoofing it may be the best way to get a top-notch apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Dani Super was apartment-hunting in her mid-20s, she needed a second opinion. Ms. Super took her mother, a former real estate broker, to a three-bedroom on the fifth floor of a late 19th-century walk-up building in Chelsea -- a place with the bones and architectural details to suggest that a woman in a hoop skirt might swish down the hallway at any moment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''She walked in and screamed, 'We'll take it!' '' Ms. Super said, demonstrating how her mother marched through the apartment, charged with absolute certainty. ''This is it,'' her mother pronounced. ''You want something like this? You'll walk.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She walked. But now, a decade later, that apartment, at 140 West 16th Street, is on the market again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Super and her husband, Mike Davis, renovated the apartment two years ago with every intention of staying put. They updated the bathroom and the kitchen and built new closets in the master bedroom -- Ms. Super points out that the closets blend nicely with the Old World style of the apartment, but are outfitted to handle today's shoes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ms. Super has a bad hip, and she and her doctors have decided that in the long run, it would be best if she skipped the stairs. So she and her husband are asking $1.295 million for their 1,600-square-foot apartment in the district of the well-regarded Public School 41.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We'll probably look for exactly the same thing,'' Ms. Super said, ''just in Brooklyn and on the first floor.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One feature that many top-floor walk-ups share is private outdoor space -- and some buyers think hauling laundry up a few flights is not so bad if you're just a few steps away from a nice quiet place to get a tan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jerry Minsky, a broker at Prudential Douglas Elliman, is selling a two-bedroom on the fifth floor of 328 Clinton Avenue in Brooklyn for $672,000. The price is no steal for a two-bedroom in that neighborhood -- Clinton Hill -- but at the top of those stairs is a private roof deck with panoramic views of brownstone Brooklyn and the Manhattan skyline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is probably the way I should sell it,'' Mr. Minsky said, leaning back in a chair and pointing his face toward the sky. ''I should just sit up here with a buyer for an hour.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that may not cut it. Walk-ups can be a tricky sell, because it takes a delicate blend of circumstances to create a happy walk-up resident.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a buyer of a certain age, all those stairs throw a wet blanket over the thrill of saving thousands of dollars. Having an elderly canine member of the family can make the journeys up and down tiresome, time consuming and kind of sad. And even people in the prime of life with the stamina to launch themselves from the first floor to the fifth without trouble -- hey, it's aerobic exercise, right? -- may find the climb unbearable if they are hauling along toddlers and strollers, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Steve Linares moved to New York last year with his wife and two small children, he rented an apartment on the fourth floor of a walk-up in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn. At the time he didn't even think about the stairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I figured it was just one of the things that happened when you got to New York,'' he said. ''We moved here from California, I parked the truck outside and started moving things up stairs. I hated it that day.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment did not grow on him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It would be different if I was by myself,'' Mr. Linares said. ''But a 3-year-old wants to be carried on the way up and on the way down. You have the stroller. You have two backpacks. You frequently have to make two different trips.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Linares, who is now separated, moved out this month. He has stairs inside his new rental, but his apartment door is on the ground floor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, would he buy in a walk-up?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''No,'' he said. ''Definitely not.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks, too, can be squeamish about stairs. Some will not finance above the fifth floor of a walk-up building. Others will not go above the fourth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of banks just won't do it because of marketability,'' said Julie Teitel, a mortgage broker at GuardHill Capital. ''I have a friend who has had a walk-up on the market for a year and a half, and they've lowered the price a lot. I'm tempted to buy it myself, but then no older people will come over.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Veronica Coppey made a fourth-floor walk-up in Riverdale work for herfor over 45 years -- all the way through her 70s, and through three children. Now 81, she moved to an elevator building in the fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've always loved it,'' Ms. Coppey said. ''But it became more of a big deal as the years went on. My lady friends found it harder and harder to visit.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment has nice prewar detail -- including a dumbwaiter. But since many buyers in New York agree with Ms. Coppey's lady friends, Daniel Wright, a vice president at Halstead, has priced it accordingly. The asking price for her two-bedroom -- at 525 West 238th Street, a prewar building with Tudor flourishes -- is $275,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Halstead Web site describes it plainly as the top floor of a walk-up. But some brokers are so concerned that the stairs will spook potential buyers that they don't mention this particular feature in the advertisement. They prefer to get the prospective buyer on the phone first, then slip in a mention of the stairs somewhere between descriptions of the light and the view.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Julie Rhinehart, a broker with Brown Harris Stevens, believes in being upfront.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Rhinehart is selling a small renovated three-bedroom at 397 Seventh Street in Park Slope for $859,000. In exchange for climbing to the fourth floor, you get a 250-square-foot roof deck with views of Manhattan, the Statue of Liberty and the harbor. The online ad is frank about the top floor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I put it right on the Web site,'' Ms. Rhinehart said, ''because the best way to market a property is to sell it for what it is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is what the housing stock is made of. When you get to New York City, walks-up are a way of life.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHOTOS: ARE WE THERE YET?: For those willing to climb, walk-ups often cost less, or have a special feature, like abundant light or no one overhead.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CO-OP boards have long had the power to reject an application without explanation, leaving buyers and sellers to wonder whether discrimination was a motivating factor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barbara Ford, a lawyer and Realtor in Floral Park and the chairwoman of the Common Interest Ownership Committee of the Long Island Board of Realtors, found that troublesome.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Because they never had to give a reason why the person was rejected,'' she said, ''it became a license to break the law.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are more than 9,300 co-op units in Suffolk County, with sizable developments in Coram, Patchogue, Bay Shore and Islip. Last year 294 units were sold, with an average price of $156,766.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Ford, determined to get the State Legislature to pass an antidiscrimination bill aimed at co-ops, made several attempts over the course of 15 years. But despite her group's lobbying, ''we were told that our efforts weren't going anywhere,'' Ms. Ford said, because organizations that own co-ops held more sway. Even when the House passed a bill, it would go on to fail in the Senate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, Ms. Ford decided she might have better luck with the county than the state. Along with her colleagues at the Realtors' board -- Randy L. Kaplan, the director of government affairs, and Kathy Engel, the president -- she approached the Suffolk County Legislature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steve Levy, the county executive, ''immediately embraced'' co-op antidiscrimination legislation, and within four months it passed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The law took effect at the end of last year -- and it now appears likely to be introduced this year to the Legislature in Nassau County, which has concentrations of co-op communities in Great Neck, Mineola, the Five Towns and Long Beach. Last year in Nassau, 643 units sold, with an average price of $230,709.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ordinance requires ''fairness in cooperative homeownership.'' Co-op boards must now state in writing why they have denied an application.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Levy described the new legislation as dovetailing with a 2007 housing bill that empowered local human rights divisions to investigate complaints.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate transactions are generally protected by antidiscrimination rules, Mr. Kaplan said. But because co-ops sell corporation shares rather than actual real estate, they fall through a ''loophole in the law to allow discrimination.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the law has not been unanimously embraced. Thomas Flood, general manager and vice president of Richland Management, oversees 20 co-op buildings in Great Neck and 215 units in Hempstead. He described it as ''too complicated'' to have to give every potential buyer a reason for rejection. ''The law fails to recognize that when you have a co-op you have five to seven people making a decision,'' Mr. Flood said. ''It's the totality of the application and there are a lot of different factors.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand Mr. Levy, explaining why he thought a buyer should have a chance at self-defense after board rejection, insisted: ''A person is left pondering, 'Why was I rejected; was it that they thought I couldn't afford it, or was it because they had some kind of prejudice?' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If applicants are being rejected for economic reasons, Mr. Levy said, they should ''have the opportunity to dispel misconceptions'' and show their earning power, whether it is child support not taken into account, or the future income of the self employed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, Mr. Kaplan and Ms. Engel of the Realtors' board met to discuss the law with Edward P. Mangano, the Nassau executive. He later expressed his support by describing its passage as ''a matter of putting pen to paper.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Martha Krisel, Nassau's chief deputy county attorney for special projects, said that although county housing law applied to all housing, including co-ops, and although it prohibited discriminatory practices, ''co-op boards do have their own rules.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, according to Ms. Engel, the law also ensures that boards no longer drag their feet in considering applications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The co-op boards must within 45 days give an acceptance or a rejection for the prospective owner,'' she said, ''and they had not done that in the past. They just put it off and put it off.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 1980s, Ms. Engel recalled, she was ''a victim of discrimination when it came to mortgages,'' because she was a single mother. ''It was horrible,'' she said. ''I had to get a co-signer. Do you know how embarrassing that is? I was the bread earner.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the new law, co-ops must use a standardized application. ''They can't arbitrarily make a more onerous application for someone they want to eliminate,'' Ms. Ford said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a survey four years ago, she added, local Realtors were polled about transactions in which ''they knew discrimination was involved.'' In more than 100 they described ''a situation where the buyers had been rejected and they felt strongly that it had been discrimination.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, when she did co-op conversion work in the 1980s, Ms. Ford recalled, ''it was blatantly brought up that they didn't want to let that person in'' for reasons that included race, ethnicity and disability. ''All you had to do was reject them,'' she said. ''You didn't have to give a reason.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She added, ''If a bank declines to give you a mortgage, they have to tell you why. But this segment of the real estate market has been able to avoid those kinds of responsibilities.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">V. Elaine Gross, the director of Erase Racism, a nonprofit advocacy group based in Syosset, said the new law was ''definitely a step in the right direction.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Levy called the legislation ''a preventive measure'' and hoped it would be instituted statewide.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Good Luck Having</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Sleepover Party</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QOur co-op board wants to impose a requirement for owners to get signed permission from management, 48 hours in advance, to have overnight guests. Is this legal?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A ''I am unaware of any city or state law dealing with this subject,'' said Steven Troup, a Manhattan co-op and condominium lawyer. ''But I strongly suspect that the proposed restrictive guest policy is unenforceable.'' Mr. Troup says that while boards have wide latitude regarding policies in a co-op, a court is likely to find the proposal an unreasonable infringement on privacy. Mr. Troup said the shareholders should petition the board, in writing, to abandon the plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher Maintenance</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Ground-Floor Unit</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QI am a co-op owner at a 90-unit building in Midtown. My ground-floor two-bedroom unit has been allocated the most shares in the building, for no apparent reason. (When I bought the apartment, I was told that it could also be used commercially.) My neighbors on higher floors, with the same square footage, pay less maintenance. Can I sue the building to reallocate the shares?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A ''Share allocations in a co-op are set at the time the building is converted and are virtually impossible to overturn,'' said Aaron Shmulewitz, a Manhattan co-op and condo lawyer. Several factors are considered when share allocations are initially set, he said, including size and location in the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The basis for the larger share allocation in this case might have been because the space was potentially convertible to commercial use. ''It is very unlikely that a court would order the board to reduce the number of shares,'' Mr. Shmulewitz said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When a Rented Unit</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Goes on the Market</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QWe rented a two-bedroom in a condominium building about eight months ago. The apartment needed substantial work to make it habitable, including cleaning, painting and having new windows installed, all at our expense. (We failed to make a thorough inspection before renting.) Now we've been informed the owners plan to sell. I fear that our final months here will be compromised by buyers looking at the place. What are our rights?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A According to Jonathan H. Newman, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, renters generally have an obligation to allow an owner to show an apartment to prospective buyers. (If there is a lease, it should provide some guidance.) Typically, the frequency of such visits must be reasonable, he said, and adequate notice must be given to the tenant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is ''reasonable'' or ''adequate,'' however, depends upon the circumstances. The tenant can work out a timetable with the owner, or decline to allow ''unreasonable'' visits with ''inadequate'' notice. If the tenant chooses the latter option, the owner can start an action in Housing Court and ask the court to decide whether the visits are reasonable and occur with enough notice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the repairs, Mr. Newman said, renters are protected by New York's ''implied warranty of habitability,'' which requires owners to ensure that residential apartments are free of conditions that could pose a threat to life, safety or well-being. So, he said, the writer should consult a lawyer to determine whether a claim against the landlord can be made to recover any costs incurred. JAY ROMANO</p>

</div><div class="author">By MARCELLE S. FISCHLER </div><div>1593 words</div><div>21 March 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ON a drive around Nassau County two and a half years ago, Paul and Jill Haining of Jackson Heights, Queens, fell in love with Sea Cliff, a quirky, gingerbread-laced village overlooking Hempstead Harbor on the North Shore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is only a square mile in area, but they discovered that space had been put to excellent use. In addition to beaches, vistas and parks, they found Gothic and Victorian ''painted ladies,'' quaint Arts and Crafts cottages, and good schools.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of this banished their thoughts of upsizing to a three-bedroom apartment in Queens, sending them instead on a search of the narrow streets and steep hillsides in this outpost of about 5,000, for a house to call their own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month the Hainings paid $669,000 -- list price -- for a stone-and-stucco three-bedroom English Cotswold-style cottage, built in 1918 on a 90-by-100-foot lot. (About two-thirds of Sea Cliff's homes and commercial buildings predate World War II.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was priced right and had multiple bids on it,'' said Mr. Haining, 41, a vice president of Skanska U.S.A. Building, a civil engineering firm. He and his wife are expecting a baby; the setup seemed ''ideal to start a family'' -- and also for the eventual purchase of a boat, which could be moored at the marina at Harry Tappen Beach, an Oyster Bay town facility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The more time the Hainings have spent in town, frequenting the restaurants, the more charmed they have felt. ''Everybody seems friendly, down to earth -- no one has false pretenses,'' Mr. Haining said. ''There are a lot of community programs and events going on.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a recent snowy night, for instance, 150 residents joined a pub crawl fund-raiser for the local beach association, paying $25 each to wander from restaurant to bar along Sea Cliff Avenue, the main shopping and dining street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, in June, 120 families will set out cast-off treasures in a community garage sale, their homes marked on a map drawn up by the civic association. Then, at a local park on the last day of school, the association hosts an ice cream social, scooping out 200 free sundaes. And come October, in a ritual that dates back 30 years, newcomers will be invited to a party at a resident's home to be introduced to the mayor, the trustees and the librarians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's the personal touch,'' said Ann DiPietro, head of the Sea Cliff Civic Association. ''We try to make everyone feel part of the village immediately.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though increasingly upscale of late, Sea Cliff retains its aura as a bohemian outpost in the midst of cookie-cutter suburbia -- an artists' haven of sorts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rose Gunter, who sings on Wednesday nights at Roots, a SoHo-esque restaurant on Sea Cliff Avenue with menu offerings like bacon-wrapped meatloaf, says she still has the ''hippie mentality'' that propelled her to Sea Cliff from the more staid Garden City three decades ago. ''It was handyman specials and people with long hair,'' recalled Ms. Gunter, 60. ''It's beautifully insidious and you can't leave. Even if you do, it draws you back.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Terry Sciubba, broker-owner of Sherlock Homes Realty and a 30-year resident, explained it this way: ''It's not like a typical Nassau County bedroom community. It's still funky. If they don't want the funk, they go to Glen Head.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT YOU'LL FIND</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sea Cliff, in the Town of Oyster Bay, hugs the shoreline south of Glen Cove and north of Glenwood Landing. It is bounded to the east by Glen Cove Avenue and the unincorporated areas of Glen Head.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among its roughly 2,000 residences, the village has cottages, bungalows and smaller Victorians with granny porches packed together along narrow streets at its heart, and larger Gothic and Victorian homes built into hillsides with commanding water views.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Because they value these properties, people have gone to great lengths to restore them,'' said Wayne P. McCann, broker-owner of Harmonious Homes. ''You won't find as much vinyl as in other communities.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fifty-four buildings have local landmark status, and 29 of those are also on state and national registries, including Village Hall and the English Tudor-style fire department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strict architectural-review and zoning requirements are viewed as a safeguard of the old-time ambience. ''We are pretty controlling,'' said Bruce Kennedy, the mayor. ''We are trying to enjoy the same quality of life we have been enjoying for 125 years.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent improvements include a new boardwalk connecting the business district and the waterfront -- long overdue, in some residents' view, as the last one was destroyed in the hurricane of 1938. Also, new streetlights and a village square clock have been added on Sea Cliff Avenue. And public and private foundation money was recently allocated for a $175,000 covered outdoor arts pavilion at the beach for live performances, Mr. Kennedy said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The postwar part of the village, on its eastern fringes, is home to a mix of Capes, colonials, split-levels and the occasional contemporary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT YOU'LL PAY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices have slipped, but ''not as steeply as the rest of Long Island,'' said Dan Maddock, the village administrator and assessor. ''There has always been an irrational appeal for the village and the Victorian houses because of its quaintness,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patricia Desocio, an agent with <span class="companylink">Charles Rutenberg Realty</span>, said Sea Cliff ''seems to hold its value because it is very artsy,'' but she also cited its wealth of homes with harbor views and their appeal to buyers from Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McCann enumerated a few other factors he viewed as assets: the one-hour commute to New York, a small-town atmosphere and walkability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Multiple Listing Service of Long Island recorded 38 sales in 2008, for an average of $713,000. Last year there were 30 sales, and the average dropped by 14.9 percent, to $607,000. But the average length of time on the market held steady for each year, at 104 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Prices were lower because the lower end sold,'' Ms. Sciubba said, citing first-time buyers wooed by the federal tax credit. It was the million-dollar-plus market that stalled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thirty-nine homes are now for sale: a four-room cottage on a 20-by-60-foot lot is listed at $319,000; a six-bedroom 1893 Victorian on a 99-by-172-foot lot is priced at $2.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two- to three-bedroom houses on tight lots can fetch as much as $550,000. Three- to four-bedroom Victorians, colonials and Capes on 60-by-90-foot lots range from $550,000 to $700,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eileen B. Heimer, a broker at Daniel Gale in Glen Head, said that of the five house rentals, the cheapest was a one-bedroom cottage, for $1,300, the priciest a two-bedroom colonial, for $2,300.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT TO DO</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Memorial Park, also known as Hippie Park, has an unobstructed view of Hempstead Harbor. On summer Thursday nights, its concerts (lemonade and cookies provided) draw a crowd. On Friday evenings the music revs up at Sea Cliff Beach. Harry Tappen Beach has a swimming pool, a playground, small boat launches and a 272-slip marina. The Sea Cliff Museum, in a former parsonage adjacent to Village Hall, is open on Sunday afternoons. The five-acre Clifton Park has ball fields. Central and Prospect Parks have playgrounds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE SCHOOLS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sea Cliff is part of the well-regarded North Shore School District, which has 2,876 students and also draws from neighboring Glen Head, Glenwood Landing and Old Brookville. There are three kindergarten-through-fifth-grade schools in total, but village children attend the Sea Cliff Elementary School, then North Shore Middle and High Schools, both in Glen Head.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAT averages in 2009 were 553 in reading, 587 in math and 550 in writing, versus 485, 502 and 478 statewide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE COMMUTE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All but one morning and one evening rush-hour <span class="companylink">Long Island Rail Road</span> train between Sea Cliff and Pennsylvania Stations transfer at either Jamaica or Mineola. The transfer ride takes about an hour, the express ride a few minutes less. A monthly pass is $204, discounted 5 percent if bought online.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sea Cliff is 23 miles from Midtown Manhattan. The drive via the Long Island Expressway takes about 45 minutes, or an hour in heavy traffic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE HISTORY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the mid-1800s, Sea Cliff was a campground for Methodist revival meetings. Its close-set tent sites eventually became lots for small bungalows. By the end of that century the place was a resort. City visitors arrived by steamship and stayed at village hotels or boarding houses, some of which ended up converted for use as private homes. It was wealthy families from Brooklyn who built the large Victorians on the hillsides for their summertime use. The village was incorporated in 1883.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Methodist tabernacle built during Sea Cliff's early campground years was used in the next century as a summer theater; actors like Yul Brynner, Shirley Booth and Basil Rathbone performed. The theater burned down in the mid-1950s.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In February 2001,a Brown University graduate with the improbably suave name Lockhart Steele took up occupancy in a one-bedroom third-floor walk-up apartment on Rivington Street, near the intersection with Ludlow. The Lower East Side could still claim, just barely, to be a marginal neighborhood. Storefront synagogues and housing projects were still more typical than bars with ostentatiously unmarked doors. The neighborhood was a good fit for Lockhart Steele: they were both, as they say, in transition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time, Steele's most glorious accomplishment was five years in the past. As a college senior, he co-wrote and self-published a compendium about the band Phish that soon became a bible for the band's international tribe of followers. But by 2001, he had left a job with an electronics trade magazine and then presided over the failure of an Internet start-up. Steele was a native of Manchester-by-the-Sea, Mass., where, he says, ''they cared more about where you went to boarding school than where you went to college.'' But Steele (St. Paul's School, Class of 1992) was a city boy now, and when he came home to the Lower East Side he was intrigued by what he saw. New people were moving into the neighborhood -- younger people, interesting people. New restaurants and bars followed. Boutiques, too. Music clubs. Lots of life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the next year, he began posting to his Web site photographs of the neighborhood, as well as short news items about local goings-on. Soon, Lockhartsteele.com was an eccentric guide to a certain New York, reflecting the author's interests and the era in which he wrote. In October 2003 he posted about, among other things, the disgraced author James Frey, Schiller's Liquor Bar and Friendster. And about real estate -- Lachlan Murdoch's purchase of 11 Spring Street, Moby's rumored move to Essex and Canal. By early 2004, the site was getting about 3,000 page-views a day, largely on the strength of his wide-ranging real estate posts, which covered apartments, condos, restaurant openings and closings -- anything a New Yorker might do with square footage, a lease and a dream.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May 2004, Steele corralled his real estate posts onto a new site he called Curbed.com. The next year, Steele broke restaurants away to form Eater.com, a site he founded with Ben Leventhal, who now works for NBC; in 2007, shopping news moved to Racked.com. Since then, Curbed has also expanded to the Hamptons, Los Angeles and San Francisco; Racked is in Los Angeles as well as New York; Eater is in five cities, including Miami and Portland, Ore.; and a blog for travelers, Gridskipper, has joined the empire. But Steele's flagship remains New York Curbed, which, with its mix of original reporting, smart packaging of links and tips from readers, has become a prime purveyor of New York real estate porn: closing prices, zoning scuttlebutt, developers' delays, digital pictures taken at open houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amazingly, the audience for Curbed NY has grown steadily, even through the real estate downturn. At first, Steele figured that because Curbed was the quintessential read for good times, its finances would suffer in a recession. He laid off three people in New York, several more nationwide (about 10 to 20 percent of payroll, Steele estimates). But for Curbed the hard times never came. The New York site had 2.6 million unique visitors in 2009, its most ever, about 400,000 more than in 2008; Steele says that advertising revenue went up even faster, by 30 percent last year (Curbed won't release dollar amounts), and that the business started making a profit in the second half of 2009. Steele, who is now 36, explains the counterintuitive growth two ways. First, the young business simply kept growing up, getting better at selling ads, for example. Second, real estate companies ''that were buying full-page ads in Vanity Fair'' began making smaller, focused buys, and that was very good for sites like Curbed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both explanations make sense, but the rosy numbers also seem to validate Steele's original insight: that people are creatures of the neighborhood. Curbed, Eater and Racked are all broken down by borough -- Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens only -- with each borough searchable by neighborhood: NoLIta, SoHo and NoHo/Central Village may all be traversable in one 10-minute perambulation, but in Steele's world, each is its own precinct, with its own heroic architects, villainous developers, quixotic preservationists and celebrity real estate agents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steele says that with the crash, Curbed's editorial tone became less cheeky and more sensitive to people's pain. That may be so, but the site still carries, in an obvious way, the DNA of the gossip site Gawker. Steele was the editorial director of Gawker Media, which also includes gossip sites like Deadspin, Gizmodo and Jezebel, from 2005 to 2007. The Gawker voice -- which Steele helped hone -- is snarky and knowing, but above all, it is episodic. In the Gawker world, every item is potentially part of a longer drama, a narrative to unfold in time (with links to old Gawker posts). At Curbed, the dramatis personae aren't adulterous actors and politicians but buildings, whose fortunes and misfortunes are chronicled in order to help the discerning buyer and to provide schadenfreude to the salivating reader.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To take one example, the Palazzo Grey, a tenement redeveloped for five condominium units on Grand Street, has been the subject of seven posts in the last 18 months. The first post, in September 2008, mocked the building's Italianate name and inflated price tag. Subsequent posts mocked the owners' inability to find any buyers and the eventual leasing of ground-floor space to a Subway sandwich shop. The last post, from July 23, is a classic of Curbed sass, mocking several other Manhattan properties to boot: ''The city's finest new luxury residential buildings have a long and proud history of rewarding buyers with quick and easy dining options as close as possible to the comfort of their new homes. On 23rd Street, Gramercy Starck brought in the Golden Arches, leading to the 'McStarck' nickname. . . . In Harlem's record-setting 111 Central Park North, the more health-conscious Subway took space. Continuing that trend, and confirming a tipster's report, BelDel beacon Palazzo Grey has unveiled its new tenant. Eat fresh, Palazzo Grey, but know that Palazzo Chupi would never sink to such depths.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Curbed's open derision can certainly infuriate the city's developers and brokers. But none of them will say an unkind word about Steele. In part that's surely because he wields a certain amount of power: after what you just read, would you buy a unit in Palazzo Grey? But it's also because Curbed appeals to so many audiences: real-estate daydreamers; neighborhood residents who mourn the loss of local news in other venues; and industry professionals for whom Curbed is essential reading and, for top brokerages like Corcoran, Stribling and Prudential Douglas Elliman, an advertising venue. Above all, Curbed has become a buyer's tip sheet. Along with blogs like Brownstoner.com (based in Brooklyn), StreetEasy.com (heavier on the sales figures and lighter on the gossip) and BrickUnderground.com, Steele's site is a first stop for New Yorkers ready to move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Curbed, like Gawker, can be moralizing, even censorious. Just ask architects like Robert M. Scarano Jr. and Karl Fischer, perennial Curbed villains. But that's surely one reason that so many in the real estate community respect Steele. They see in him someone who thinks deeply about the character of neighborhoods. They notice that Curbed reserves its harshest criticism for those who flout zoning laws or -- worse -- do uncreative work. They recognize, above all, that at a time when the real estate market is as soft as a two-minute egg, Lockhart Steele keeps the faith.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steele's implicit optimism -- that real estate, even when it deserves to be mocked, is always worth the attention -- makes him infectious. The first person I asked about Steele was Rachel Sklar, the former Huffington Post media writer, known for not suffering fools and for uncovering a lot of them. I expected a cool appraisal, some choice words putting Steele in context and taking the measure of the man. Here, in slightly condensed version, is what she said:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The first time I met him, I responded the way a lot of people respond, which is, 'You're Lockhart Steele!' And going on and on about how his name sounded like a James Bond character -- how intimidating is that! Lockhart Steele with babes on each arm! Lockhart Steele will engage in a death battle in a back alley and emerge with a martini. Lock has been everywhere. . . . I have been to the Hamptons with Lock. Only once, but that counts. It's the only way to go to the Hamptons. . . . It is de rigueur for Lock to show up at various Manhattan A-list parties. He is that guy now. But he doesn't stray far from his intellectual, classically geeky roots, no matter how fabulously collared his flowered shirts are. . . . He's not just a real estate nerd. He is a fully formed New York renaissance man for the Internet era.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Sklar insisted that while she had been to the Hamptons with Lock, and adored Lock, she wasn't in his inner circle. For that point of view, I had to talk to Brooke Hammerling, who founded Brew Media Relations, a hip public relations firm in New York. She was similarly effusive. ''He knows things are going to happen before they happen,'' she told me. ''He explained blogging to me before blogging was a known thing. Same with Twitter. Same with Foursquare. All mainstream now, naturally. He's my guide through the Internet world. My Yoda is Lockhart.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When asked about Steele, Dottie Herman, the head of Prudential Douglas Elliman Real Estate, the grand white-shoe firm, was less starry-eyed but in her way no less complimentary. She's more famous, and certainly more feared, than Steele, so she didn't sound overawed by him. But she sees in him a fellow entrepreneur and a useful ally -- she often feeds him tips about her new listings. Herman once invited Steele to address her senior managers. The way Steele tells it, she interrupted him at one point to announce to her employees that they had better pay attention to what he was saying. The Internet was the future of real estate, and Lockhart Steele was the Internet. Herman confirms the story: ''I said, 'Listen, the way you do it is over, and you better get with it.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What she meant is that thanks to people like Steele, the broker's job has changed. ''It's like if you get sick now, a lot of people will go to WebMD first,'' Herman says -- and Curbed is WebMD for real estate, the site where the novice goes to get up to speed. ''Your consumer is more informed, but not necessarily better informed.'' The broker's job is no longer to tell people what a house is worth, or what nearby properties have sold for -- everybody knows that now. Instead, a broker is more useful calming down a buyer agitated by a proliferation of Web gossip. The broker is less salesman, more therapist, or oracle. And by professional obligation, a daily reader of real estate blogs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most sober assessment I heard of Steele came from the man himself. We spoke several times on the phone, then finally met for dinner at Momofuku Ssam Bar, the East Village restaurant owned by David Chang, who is a friend of Steele's. I recognized Steele. We debated against each other in regional competitions in high school, 20 years ago. And here, sitting across the table from me, was the same guy, practically unchanged, with the shaggy bowl cut and the soft voice. I was hoping to see one of the famous flowered shirts that Rachel Sklar had mentioned, but tonight his sweater and button-down could have come from the back of his prep-school closet. He didn't seem cool, which is probably why his cool friends think he's so cool. He wouldn't talk about his romantic life, but in other ways he was earnest and forthcoming. He volunteered that his father drank himself to death three years ago. And he told me that in 1997, he killed a St. Paul's classmate, his best friend, John-Christophe Schlesinger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you're going to do a story about me, you should know the story,'' Steele said. ''I was driving early in the morning, and I fell asleep at the wheel, and we crashed and he died. It's something that's with me every day.'' I asked about how Schlesinger's parents treated him after that. ''If at some point in my life,'' he said, ''I am as good to people as they have been to me, that would be amazing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After that, it was tough to ask Steele really pointed questions, but I tried. Curbed seems to waste little space on apartments worth less than half a million dollars, and Steele had already admitted, during one phone call, that Curbed didn't do much, or enough, to cover real estate in the normal person's price range. ''I think it's a fair critique,'' he said. ''I make this joke that blogs exist because people are bored at work -- which is to say people with white-collar jobs and big screens to stare at. That's undeniable.'' But he was not willing to admit that that might be a bad mission. To him, it was virtuous. ''If we're serving our audience, which is what any self-respecting publication should do, then undeniably we're serving a more upscale audience than any slice of New York.'' But it still might be morally ambiguous. ''Part of the job of Curbed is to turn news into something wry and readable. But how do you do that with affordable housing? We try to cover that, but when we do, we end up as dry and self-important as those topics can be.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fact that Curbed doesn't even cover the Bronx, for instance, suggests the limits of the Lockhart Steele vision, as well as the limits of what high-end advertisers want to support. At dinner, he tried, with some success, to have it both ways. ''I am not,'' he said, ''going to deny there is some general societal good in creating entertaining media. It's fun, and I don't think we need to pretend to a higher good than that to justify our existence.'' But, he added, ''if I were going to try to pretend we're doing some great societal good, we're part of this overall trend toward transparency. This industry has been traditionally closed to consumers. . . . We create more of a balance of power between the industry and the people making the biggest purchase of their lives.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To create that balance of power, the information needs to be reliable, and Curbed has made strides in ensuring the accuracy of its reporting. ''If you look back at what blogging was five years ago,'' Steele said, ''the rules have transitioned from being a little bit Wild West, anything goes to drawing closer to fundamental rules in play for print publications.'' He pointed to a story Curbed ran on Jan. 21 about a building at 211 Elizabeth Street. ''It's really fancy, a condo building, prices high, has a name-brand interior designer, name-brand real estate brokerage is selling it. Every reason to believe it's a quality project. But we get an e-mail from a reader who has purchased in the building and is very, very unhappy with the quality of work in this place. And she sent us basically a rant -- water leak, flood.'' In the old days, Steele says, he might have just posted the rant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in this case, Steele said, his writer Joey Arak wrote to the woman. ''He writes back to her, like, 'O.K., if we're going to do this story, like, do you have some photos or other ways to back up your claims?' Sure enough, she sends on a whole bunch of photos. Then we go to the developers, like, 'Hey we got this complaint from a reader, do you want to respond?' And the final post includes the woman's claims, photos and a post from the developer. That is pretty standard journalism.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well, more or less -- Arak didn't ask to see the condo in question or track down other owners in the building. But in the Curbediverse, as the site modestly calls the world whose story it tells, every new building, every architectural misstep, every bit of shoddy construction, every scrumptious Sunday open house and every regrettable ground-floor Subway has its moment on the screen, for all eyes to see. So that neighbors can whisper, so that buyers can reconsider the neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steele still lives in the same Rivington Street apartment whose sidewalk life inspired him to start blogging. ''I am probably about ready to buy a place and have been too busy working to get around to it,'' he said. He's ''probably overdue for a move.'' It's ''probably ridiculous'' that he has stayed in one place. Then again, it seems doubtful that he's in a hurry to leave. ''I like where I live,'' he said, as if a confession has been forced from him. ''I love my neighborhood.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if he were to move, if he were to raise the profile of some new building with his very chic, very flower-shirted presence, then tell me: who would tip off Curbed?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OTTAWA -- Marie-Yvonne Paint, a real estate agent in Montreal, has the kind of problem most of her counterparts in the United States can only dream about.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have a shortage of inventory right now,'' said Ms. Paint, who focuses on the exclusive and expensive municipality of Westmount. ''It's very annoying. We have buyers ready to buy and not much to show.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Paint's experience is not an isolated example. Like most of the world, Canada's real estate market slumped during the recession. But now, instead of worrying about the recovery of the real estate market, some Canadians are concerned about the prospect of a price bubble. The Canadian Real Estate Association reported that the average price of existing homes rose 19.6 percent in January compared with those in the month a year earlier, the latest in a string of substantial gains dating back through last autumn. By contrast, the average price of existing homes rose 2.6 percent in the United States in the same period, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such drastic percentage gains are not just a reflection of the market's earlier depths. In some Canadian cities, particularly Toronto and Vancouver, prices appear to be heading toward record levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's no surprise the housing market responded to low interest rates,'' said Craig Alexander, the deputy chief economist of the <span class="companylink">Toronto-Dominion Bank</span>. ''The real question is what's going to happen in the next year. It can't continue at the current pace, otherwise a bubble will form.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian home buyers, of course, are not unique in having access to low-interest mortgages. But Mr. Alexander and others attribute the Canadian market's revival to a series of measures that ensured that the recession in Canada did not turn into a real estate disaster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps chief among them is the country's retail banking system, which is effectively an oligopoly dominated by five national banks, including <span class="companylink">Toronto-Dominion</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the time, that arrangement is less than popular among Canadians, who think that a lack of competition leads to, among other things, low interest rates on savings and high service fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Public resentment has repeatedly caused politicians to block mergers between the banks. But in the lead-up to the credit crisis, the closed-shop nature of banking in Canada proved to be the government's, and the economy's, best friend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mindful of government oversight, Canadian banks by and large avoided the structured debt products that imperiled many of their American counterparts. They also maintained comparatively tight controls on mortgage lending to consumers. When zero percent down payments on mortgages were widely available in the United States, Canadians were typically required to put down at least 10 percent. American-style amortization periods stretching beyond 25 years were also relatively unknown in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In Canada, standards got nowhere near as low,'' said Timothy D. Hockey, the chief executive of <span class="companylink">TD Canada Trust</span>, <span class="companylink">Toronto-Dominion</span>'s Canadian retail banking operation. ''When the crisis came upon us, the standards didn't have to change.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One result of that, said Phil Soper, the president and chief executive of Brookfield Real Estate Services of Toronto, is that the slump in housing starts and existing home prices was delayed by about a year in Canada until late 2008. Then, when interest among buyers began to return last year, Canada's still-healthy banks were able to provide mortgages, and housing prices were not depressed by a glut of defaulted properties in forced sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One of the things we see in American businesses that we don't see in our Canadian businesses is a willingness to really push the limits,'' said Mr. Soper, whose operations include Royal LePage, one of Canada's leading real estate brokers. ''When bubbles burst, sometimes the turtle wins.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While demand from buyers has returned, most real estate analysts agree that sellers have been slower to move. There are a variety of theories for that reluctance. Winter is not seen as a optimal season for selling homes in most parts of the country, given Canada's climate. Some economists speculate that many sellers are holding out for more definitive signs of a market comeback. And others think that many sellers have delayed putting their homes on the market because they are undertaking repairs prompted by recently expired home renovation tax credits that were part of Canada's economic recovery plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But whatever the cause, the expectation -- or perhaps the hope -- is that the arrival of spring and the upward trend in prices will inspire increasing numbers of people to list their homes. The increase in supply, in turn, should prevent prices from escalating to bubble levels. January's statistics, both for resales and housing starts, suggest that pattern may be developing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Soper is among those who caution against reading too much into the current market buoyancy about long-term price trends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Canadians in the financial and real estate sectors feel a little bit smarter than they should about the strength of the economy and industry over the last few years,'' he said. ''Certainly the underlying economy isn't strong enough to support the prices we've seen over the last few weeks.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Grants are getting a divorce,'' Ian Kleier says after studying the gossip pages at the kitchen table of his Park Avenue apartment. His wife, Michele, is not surprised. ''I had my suspicions,'' she says, and starts to list the warning signs while scrambling eggs for ''the girls,'' the couple's trio of white Maltese. Ian cuts her off. ''It's not a pretty divorce, and I think you should jump right on top of it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's like a scene from ''The Real Housewives of New York,'' only the Kleiers are the Real Realtors of New York, owners of a family-run real estate firm and, beginning on Thursday, stars of a new reality series on HGTV, ''Selling New York,'' which focuses on just that. The Kleiers, who are grandparents, sell multimillion-dollar apartments to an older Upper East Side clientele. They and their two daughters are matched up against younger, hipper brokers from another firm, Core, catering to young professionals willing to pay more than $2 million for downtown views, double sinks and rooftop pool parties that are, as one events planner puts it, ''a little Puff Daddyish.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Selling New York'' is a bit of a jolt because, at first glance, it looks like a flashback to pre-recession values. But it's less a harbinger of economic recovery than a midcourse correction for HGTV, a cable network that fed -- and feasted on -- the fantasies and delusions of the housing bubble and then, when that collapsed, went into austerity and atonement mode with series like the 2009 ''Real Estate Intervention.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HGTV is getting its building buzz back, but gingerly. Most of the new series, and there are six of them in prime time alone, focus on modest middle-class home sales and improvement projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And like ''Selling New York,'' these new series have learned a lesson not from housing starts but from the ''Real Housewives'' franchise on Bravo: There is no dip in the market of people making spectacles of themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reality shows like ''Real Housewives'' -- be they of Orange County, Atlanta, New York or New Jersey -- ''The Bachelor,'' ''Jersey Shore'' (and a hair salon knockoff, ''Jerseylicious,'' on Style beginning this weekend) keep growing more stagily preposterous and rococo. Paradoxically, a few of them are tiptoeing around the housing market collapse too: Lynne, one of the housewives in Season 5 of ''Orange County,'' was forced to downsize, then was served an eviction notice on her Laguna Beach rental.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HGTV, however, is seeking shelter in Manhattan penthouses, beauty makeovers and home improvement for the heart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it began, ''Real Estate Intervention'' taught distraught homeowners how to deal with the collapse of the housing market. Now ''Home Rules,'' which had its premiere on Monday, teaches distraught homeowners how to deal with the collapse of their marriages -- while renovating their houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first episode the host, Fran Harris, a former WNBA player who is now a life coach, helps an estranged couple, Matt and Heather, rekindle their ardor; a new master bedroom and a remodeled kitchen are dangled as rewards for completing communication assignments, like listening. ''You work on your inner house,'' Ms. Harris says, ''we'll work on your outer house.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While workers tear out pink countertops and replace rotting planks, Matt and Heather renew their vows on a gauzy, candlelit set that rivals the most poignant rose ceremony on ''The Bachelor.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HGTV calls ''Tough as Nails,'' which begins on Thursday, a docudrama, but it looks more like a docu-telenovela, a weekly series about a tough, comely Boston developer, Cindy Stumpo, who barks orders at all-male construction crews but cannot still the yearnings of her own heart. Like Bathsheba Everdene, the Thomas Hardy heroine who is torn between a loyal farmhand and her rakish runaway husband, Cindy mistily tells the camera that she trusts and relies on Michael, her foreman, but still has ''feelings'' for her ex-husband, Joe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Marriage Under Construction,'' which began on Tuesday, follows a pair of newlyweds in Toronto, Natalie and Rod. Their marriage and tangential real estate problems are served up as a kind of romantic sitcom, an HGTV version of ''Tori &amp;Dean: Home Sweet Hollywood.'' Rod, who has a burly ''King of Queens'' physique, is good-humored and somewhat slothful; Natalie is attractive, determined and a little bossy. While brushing her teeth, Natalie asks Rod, seated in front of a laptop, what he is doing. ''Looking at houses,'' he replies though he is playing backgammon on an online gaming site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My First Sale,'' starting Thursday, focuses on a different family each week but milks each housing decision for melodrama and whatever naughtiness it can glean. Shelly and Brian have a new baby and no privacy in the loftlike, one-bedroom that they're selling. They have to lower their price and just barely wrangle the mortgage for a bigger house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are last seen in their new kitchen, doors closed and blender whirring. ''So, is it bad that we sold our house and bought a new one so we could drink after the baby goes to bed?'' Brian asks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''No,'' Shelly coos. ''No. I've been waiting to have margaritas for months.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even ''The Antonio Treatment,'' a design show that began on Sunday and stars Antonio Ballatore, the heavily tattooed winner of Season 4 of ''HGTV Design Star,'' tries to give some reality show hype along with moldings and ceiling frescos by focusing on his wacky construction crew, which includes heavy-metal musicians and an English bulldog named Chewy. Mr. Ballatore puts it this way, ''We all got these crazy personalities going on.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And on HGTV it's the personalities that have room for improvement.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHOENIX -- Perhaps it was just a matter of time, but three years after this city's housing market collapsed in spectacular fashion, commercial real estate has followed it off the cliff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average price paid for office space in the Phoenix metro area tumbled more than 50 percent last year, from $205 a square foot in 2008 to $102 a square foot in 2009, according to data compiled by Kammrath &amp;Associates, a local real estate analysis firm. Retail and industrial space underwent similar declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Prices are falling like a stone,'' said Bob Kammrath, who has studied the commercial market in Phoenix since 1981. ''I see them going lower.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recession has been the main instigator of the crash, but overbuilding and speculation set the stage. In a mirror image of the housing bubble, relaxed lending standards and a boom mentality prompted the construction of hundreds of offices, shopping centers, industrial buildings, hotels and apartments from 2005 to 2009 -- about 86.5 million square feet of new commercial space in all, according to research by <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2006, when growth peaked, about 30 percent of the Phoenix area's economic output was tied to real estate and construction. So it was not long after the once white-hot housing market fell apart, in 2007, that the rest of the city's economy stumbled, and hard. As jobs in construction and real estate dried up, and stock market losses curbed the relocation of retirees from the north, in-migration to the city radically slowed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commercial brokers blame a confluence of factors for the worst downturn in memory: rampant overbuilding, a national economic crisis, spiking unemployment and a near halt in population growth. The result is visible all over the city in the form of empty storefronts and ''for lease'' signs affixed to office buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The worst-off of these projects were built in marginal locations on the outskirts of the metropolitan area, and stand completely empty months and even years after completion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've got some see-through shopping centers,'' said David Wetta, senior vice president and managing director in the Phoenix office of the real estate brokerage Marcus &amp;Millichap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A handful of major developments throughout the metro area simply collapsed midconstruction and linger, half-built, as gloomy reminders of the sudden end of good times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One such failure, the Hotel Monroe, sits in the heart of downtown Phoenix, just a few blocks from City Hall. Started in 2006, its plans were extravagant even by the bloated standards of the bubble era. The 144-room boutique hotel was to be housed in a rehabilitated 12-story Art Deco office building from the 1930s and would include opulent ''Rock Star'' suites, a five-star restaurant, a rooftop nightclub and 24-hour room service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction began in 2007 but ground to a halt a year later when the project's banker, Mortgages Ltd. -- for a short time, Arizona's largest private lender -- cut off financing, en route to its own bankruptcy. The hotel remains unfinished, with dark windows and a desolate mien; Grace Communities, its developer, was recently cited by the City of Phoenix for code violations including graffiti on exterior walls and trash and debris around the premises.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When or how the hotel will be finished is uncertain, as the building is in foreclosure and headed to a trustee's sale in April. There, 13 investors will try to recoup $76.5 million in loans, though experts say the building is unlikely to fetch anywhere near that amount.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet it is not just new commercial developments that are foundering. Older properties -- in particular, those that sold at big premiums during the market run-up -- are also struggling with rising vacancy rates, shrinking rent rolls and high debt loads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A prime example is the Viad Corporate Center, a 24-story, 478,000-square-foot high-rise in midtown Phoenix, which was built in 1991 and bought for an estimated $105 million in 2006. Earlier this month, <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> filed a motion in court to appoint a receiver for the property, citing the failure of the building's owner to stay current on a $65 million loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>'s move to foreclose on the tower is one prominent sign that lenders are losing patience with large commercial borrowers and are stepping up efforts to resolve problem loans behind big properties. Commercial mortgages in Phoenix are souring at their highest rate in years: according to Foresight Analytics, a banking analysis firm, 5.3 percent of commercial mortgages in the metro area were delinquent in the fourth quarter of 2009, up from 2.3 percent at the same period in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet even as delinquencies climb, some analysts say lenders have not been aggressive enough in writing down loans and repossessing and disposing of properties -- often a painful process for both banks and borrowers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's more to go, just to get caught up with the current volume of defaulted loans,'' said Matt Anderson, an analyst with Foresight Analytics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High unemployment (over 9 percent here in February), combined with continued weakness in housing and sluggish consumer spending, will most likely prolong the pain in Phoenix's commercial market. Since the recession began nearly two years ago, many business owners here have dipped into savings and lines of credit in an effort to stay afloat. As these resources run out, more tenants are closing up shop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already, vacancies are at troubling levels: according to <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>, 25.4 percent of office space in the Phoenix metro area is unoccupied. Retail has also deteriorated: vacancy rates for that sector have risen the last 11 quarters, to 11.4 percent at the end of 2009. These rates may not reflect the full extent of the industry's weakness, however, as some landlords appear disinclined to evict even seriously delinquent tenants because of the difficulty of attracting businesses to replace them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet despite the avalanche of negative indicators, some in the public and private sector are keen to point out bright spots for commercial real estate in the Phoenix area. Desirable pockets in affluent cities like Scottsdale have little vacant space available at any price, while areas close to the downtown core and along established urban corridors are weathering the storm fairly well. CityScape, a $900 million commercial development in the heart of downtown Phoenix that includes shops, restaurants and a 27-story office tower, is at least 75 percent leased months ahead of its scheduled opening this summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Billions of dollars in public investment in a light-rail system, and improvements to the Arizona State University campus and the Phoenix Convention Center, should also help commerce. The improvements are already helping downtown Phoenix shake its reputation as a ghost town after dark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is, too, no shortage of bargain properties to be leased or bought, particularly on the city's outskirts. Some assets are from portfolios of failed banks now held by the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, and are selling for rock-bottom prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mood of commercial real estate professionals is improving, said Kevin Calihan, senior vice president at <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span> in Phoenix. ''People are starting to feel the end is in sight,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But others are less optimistic. ''We're in the first or second inning,'' said Mr. Wetta of Marcus &amp;Millichap. ''We haven't seen the worst of it yet.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home building slowed in February as snowstorms stopped construction in some of the country's largest markets, a Commerce Department report indicated Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the data suggested that builders might also be curtailing construction in response to disappointing demand, despite the government's efforts to lure buyers with a tax credit of up to $8,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction fell 5.9 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 575,000 homes, with much of the weakness in the Northeast and South, where the severe weather was concentrated. Building of single-family homes fell 0.6 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The outlook remains bleak,'' Paul Dales, an economist for Capital Economics, wrote in a research note. ''Home building activity remains very low by historical standards and is set to remain that way for some time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop in February followed an increase in January that was much better than initially reported. The government said Tuesday that construction increased 6.6 percent in January, nearly triple the original estimate, with much of the momentum coming from single-family homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts had expected home construction to decrease by less in February, but those forecasts did not account for the surge in building in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slowdown revived a debate about the potency of the tax credit for home buyers. While economists said most of the decline in February could be tied to weather, builders might also be responding to tepid demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes fell to a record low in January, resurrecting worries that consumers would delay home buying until the jobs market turned around. The government's tax credit helped lift sales in the fall. But analysts have yet to see the second wave of buying they predicted as the April 30 deadline for the credit approaches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, building permits, which indicate future activity and were not affected by weather, fell 1.6 percent in February after robust gains in recent months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A large supply of excess homes on the market is keeping builders on the sidelines. Economists estimate there are 3.8 million homes for sale in the United States, and the market may be flooded with an additional five million to six million in foreclosed properties over the next several years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's still a real struggle for builders,'' said Nigel Gault, an economist for IHS Global Insight. ''They're competing with a lot of distressed properties on the market at bargain prices.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The influx of foreclosed homes is also making it harder for Americans to sell their homes, contributing to the weak demand for new homes. Over the last year, the housing market has moved mostly sideways: the rate of construction was 0.2 percent higher in February compared with a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adding to the troubles is the foundering commercial real estate market, where vacancy rates are high and financiers are scarce. That has curbed apartment construction. In February, construction of apartments with five units or more fell 43.1 percent to an annual rate of 58,000 units, though economists cautioned that the trends could be exaggerated at such low levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market's recovery may depend largely on how quickly unemployment eases. It may take several years before the jobless rate, now 9.7 percent, retreats to normal levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In part because of the weak jobs market, the Federal Reserve said on Tuesday that it would keep interest rates near zero for an extended period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the low rates, economists say inflation appears to be in check in the United States. A Labor Department report released Tuesday reinforced that view, with import prices, a gauge of inflation, falling 0.3 percent in February, mostly because of a decline in fuel prices.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cover article on March 14 about the Frugal Traveler's trip to San Francisco with his toddler misstated the fare for a BART train between the San Francisco airport and the 24th and Mission stop. It is $7.95 each way, not $5.10 each way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Sun Mar 28 2010</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DAY after day in January, the rain poured down on the California coast without pause or pity -- some of the worst storms to hit the state in a decade. High winds took out power lines and overturned SUVs. Garbage washed up on beaches. Hundreds of people were evacuated from their mudslide-threatened homes. And on one particular Tuesday afternoon, in the Mission District of San Francisco, the heavens focused their fury on a visiting father from Brooklyn -- i.e., me -- who, so self-absorbed he was blind to the calamities around him, had decided to walk home from the supermarket with his 13-month-old daughter, Sasha, in her stroller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only six and a half blocks, I thought. No need to use my weeklong bus and cable car pass ($26). But within a block, the downpour had rolled off my waterproof jacket and soaked my jeans through. On the next block, a homeless woman joined us, complaining that ''it's a terrible thing when you have to steal cupcakes to eat.'' True enough, but I was too stressed to commiserate. And on the third block, the inevitable happened. The paper grocery bag hanging over the back of Sasha's stroller disintegrated in the rain, spilling a week's worth of organic groceries -- a dense honeydew melon, supple young broccoli, tiny cremini mushrooms -- across the flooded sidewalk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Defeated, I screamed words that young Sasha probably should not have heard. This was not how the week was supposed to go. With her mother in Berlin on a business trip, Sasha and I had flown here for a little low-budget, daddy-daughter bonding time. Ambitious? Perhaps. But in her brief life span, Sasha had already proven herself a hardy voyager, with four overseas trips under her belt. She also had flying down to an art, sleeping almost from takeoff to landing, with hardly a squeal in between. This trip was a chance to demonstrate my talents not only as a frugal traveler but as a self-sufficient, all-in-one SuperDad! I would feed, dress, clean and entertain my little girl for an entire week, while exploring a strange city on the other side of the country -- and doing so, of course, without spending a lot of money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first glance, San Francisco would seem to be precisely the wrong place to do this. According to Forbes magazine's 2009 survey of America's most expensive cities, San Francisco ranks fourth, and according to 2008 Census figures, San Franciscans have fewer children than the rest of the state. The hills are rough on strollers, and the homeless people, strip clubs and ubiquitous pot smoke can challenge a protective parent's patience. Do the math, and it looks crazy to take a baby there for vacation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But baby vacations involve a complicated calculus. For one thing, at just over a year old, Sasha isn't exactly a sophisticated traveler. All she wants is to run around and see new things -- whether on the street or at an art gallery -- which meant that, for the most part, we could go wherever I wanted. And although San Franciscans may not be the most family-oriented, those who do have kids form fierce, tightly knit communities centered on schools, playgrounds and the Internet, which I hoped to tap into. The, uh, colorful street life, meanwhile, would hardly intrude on a 1-year-old's consciousness; no awkward explanations necessary. And as for the expense, well, I knew I'd find ways around that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On that front, that rainy Tuesday was actually going well. Sasha's stroller was sturdy and lightweight, the cheapest in the Maclaren line and ideal for travel, and its transparent rain fly was keeping her warm and dry. Those groceries bobbing in the flood had been a bargain, too, despite the fact that they'd come from the Rainbow Grocery, a co-op that composts, shuts down for both Cesar Chavez Day and Gay Pride Day and is, generally, expensive. Except on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays, when you can deploy a coveted coupon, found in the local phone book, to knock 20 percent off your bill. (Mine came to $26.95.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And when we finally soldiered home -- after I'd taken a deep breath, found the reusable grocery bag I'd hidden in Sasha's diaper bag and gathered up our food -- it was not to a cheap hotel but to a gorgeous Victorian house for which we were paying $90 a night. I'd found the place through AirBnB.com, a Web site that lets people rent out their futons, spare rooms and entire apartments to travelers like myself; it's a cross between <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span>, CouchSurfing and VRBO.com. In fact, I never even looked for a hotel at all. Why spend more for less room, a hip lounge and a fitness center? Traveling with a young child brings new requirements: a kitchen where I could make Sasha cheap, healthful meals; a spacious bathroom where I could bathe her; free access to laundry machines; and plenty of space to run.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AirBnB is particularly strong in San Francisco, too, with nearly 400 listings to choose from. And I was sorely tempted by many of them -- a two-bedroom apartment near Golden Gate Park for $64, a big one-bedroom for $95 in the Richmond District -- but not all were available on my dates. Not that that mattered once I found the listing entitled ''Victorian splendor in San Francisco.'' The photos were brilliant, the amenities spectacular and the 19 reviews enthusiastic (''calm and sunny oasis to return to after a day packed with sightseeing,'' wrote one). Plus, it was in the Mission, a heavily Latino neighborhood that has seen a lot of gentrification in the last two decades, resulting in a place where serious-minded parents push strollers from playground to taco truck to craft-beer bar -- in other words, my kind of place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Victorian splendor'' was an entire floor of a classic painted-lady Victorian, with hardwood floors and super-high ceilings, plush couches and a soft bed, a washer and a dryer and a fully equipped kitchen, all decorated with relics and photos that the owner, Joyce Ferman, a teacher, photographer and tour guide, had taken from trips to Ecuador, Vietnam and beyond. (Most of these I moved to higher shelves, away from Sasha's curious hands.) The kitchen had staples like rice, olive oil and coffee, and Ms. Ferman, who was away in Los Angeles almost the whole week, had left us a fresh-baked loaf of banana bread and, stuck to the refrigerator, that Rainbow Grocery coupon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the weather so miserable, I was grateful for the kind of creature comforts that would have cost a fortune at a hotel. In the mornings, after Sasha had eaten her breakfast of bananas, oatmeal, yogurt and orange juice, we'd play in the living room and listen to Dan Zanes on my laptop, and Sasha would stare out the big bay windows at the damp, quiet street, cheering and tapping at the glass in wonder. Often, just as the rain would ease, she'd get sleepy and I'd put her down for a nap in her PeaPod, an ultralight travel bed more than worth its $60 price tag. For the next two hours, I'd anxiously plan excursions, hoping the rain would hold off long enough for us to get out, have fun and be back by 5 p.m. to begin the nightly routine of dinner, bath and bedtime.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As soon as Sasha woke up, we'd rush out the door to the Mission Playground, which had slides, a jungle gym and swings. Sasha went ''Whee!'' as she swung on the swings and swooped down the slides, and at times I could relax on a bench and watch her from afar, knowing that the moms and dads and grandparents and nannies were all keeping half an eye on one another's charges. We didn't interact much beyond ''And how old is this one?'' But there was something comforting about simply being together as our children played.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And whenever the drops would fall, Sasha and I would dash off in search of shelter. We didn't have far to go: The Mission has lots of kid-friendly businesses. The Curiosity Shoppe was, you guessed it, filled with curiosities like Silly Putty eggs ($2), smiley face buttons ($1) and marbles (10 cents). Almost next door, Little Otsu carried printed curiosities: books, postcards, notepads -- all illustrated with a careful, if twee, touch. I bought ''The Tour Diary,'' by Allison Cole ($9, marked down from $14), a beautiful travel journal in which Sasha may one day jot down notes and travel observations of her own. (A dad can dream, can't he?)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mission itself could probably have sustained us the entire week -- bilingual rhyme time at the local library, a tour of Mission murals -- but my legs were restless. So I consulted Mission Parents, a 420-plus-member parenting-themed discussion group on <span class="companylink">Yahoo</span>, which hosts similar groups across the country (like Dallas DiaperFreeBaby, BaltimoreSingleParents). These are some of the best places to seek out advice on everything from cheap diapers and toy stores to baby sitters and E.R.'s, and are worth joining whenever you have a trip planned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Mission Parents, for example, when I mentioned I was considering going to the ever-popular Exploratorium, one of the members warned me it was ''geared more towards older kids.'' Instead, several parents suggested the California Academy of Sciences, a museum in Golden Gate Park, for its baby-friendly aquarium and indoor rain forest. Another parent cautioned that it was expensive ($24.95!), but on the third Wednesday of every month, the museum was free.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That very Wednesday, I hauled Sasha by Muni to the academy. It was perfect. Wherever Sasha looked, there were fish -- orange and blue, green and red, yellow and black -- all of them just the other side of the glass, where Sasha could almost reach them. Ghostly jellyfish. Fragile seahorses. Lumbering 200-pound sea bass. An ocher starfish whose knobbly skin she tentatively touched. Even better, she could roam freely among the crowds, stopping where and when she wanted to marvel at the undreamed-of creatures of the deep, or to befriend another equally fascinated toddler. She was giddy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The thing is, I knew she would be equally giddy wherever we went, just as long as she had something new to look at. Adult-focused, child-appropriate, it didn't matter. I could go wherever I wanted -- within reason. The Museum of Modern Art, for example, was a surprisingly good choice. Admission had been cut to zero (from $15) in celebration of its 75th anniversary, which meant not only did we get in free but so did thousands of other people as well, and the general bustle of the crowds, I knew, would mask any noisy, naughty behavior by Sasha. But she was a doll, and the only sounds that emerged from her were spontaneous chuckles as we listened to the writer Michelle Tea discuss Andy Warhol's work in front of his self-portrait.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Cartoon Art Museum (admission $6, under 6 free), which traces the history of comic strips, comic books and animated films from Japanese prints to contemporary Web comics, was the exact opposite -- quiet and untrafficked. And even if there were other patrons for Sasha to disturb, it was a cartoon museum -- how can you complain about kids there? While I gravitated to the samurai-themed exhibition (Usagi Yojimbo! Samurai Jack!), Sasha took advantage of the open gallery space to wander hither and yon, settling down (on my lap) only to watch a screening of the 1990 computer-animation classic ''Grinning Evil Death.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When I look back on these excursions now, they seem almost ideal -- a balance of highbrow culture for adults and fun-filled kiddie joy. But at the time, I was beyond stressed. At the cartoon museum, I went cross-eyed focusing on both the art and Sasha's whereabouts, and at the modern art museum I tried hopelessly to get her to drink warm steamed milk from the museum's Blue Bottle Coffee stand. At the Steinhart Aquarium, I even snapped at an employee who asked me to move off the stairs, where I was struggling to get Sasha's jacket on. I hope if he's reading this, he'll accept my apologies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Likewise, feeding Sasha every day was a Herculean task. Actually, feeding a baby frugally and healthily can be quite easy, especially if you have a kitchen: just buy groceries and cook at home. And that's what I was doing some of the time, preparing Sasha's favorites -- rice and broccoli, spaghetti with meat sauce -- with plenty of leftovers for lunch. But this was San Francisco! We couldn't just stay home. I felt compelled to expose Sasha to the wealth of taquerias and street carts and artisanal bakeries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Udupi Palace, an Indian restaurant recommended by a Mission Parents member, I plopped Sasha into a highchair and ordered lunch: saag paneer with rice ($9.95), seemingly a surefire hit with a girl accustomed to Malaysian curries and Thai stir-fried noodles. But no luck. Sasha spat out the pureed spinach and made a face at the rice, though she ate the paneer with gusto. That night, we dined at home on a chicken-mole burrito ($7.50) from Papalote, one of the healthier, fresher Mexican spots in the Mission. Again, she was uninterested. It turned out she preferred the cheaper, greasier and far superior burritos ($5.45) from El Farolito.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another night, I pushed us harder, hopping the BART one stop south to the Chenery Park Restaurant, a white-tablecloth place where Tuesdays are kids' nights, meaning Sasha could make noise and drop food on the floor, and no one would notice. But when her safe-bet macaroni and cheese ($6) arrived, she would have none of it. I despaired, powering through my excellent smoked pork chop ($20) and Russian River ale in hopes of getting out of there quickly, until finally I let her taste some spinach sauteed with garlic -- and she loved it. ''But,'' I wanted to yell, ''you hated spinach yesterday!''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, however, I remember only the good: Sasha's laugh and my cold beer; the friendly waitresses and the bus passengers who graciously ignored the stroller bumping at their toes. But I also know that every day depleted me so fully I couldn't stay awake past 9:30 p.m. One week with this baby was more physically challenging than hiking across Montana and more psychologically draining than ... anything I've ever done.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which was why, whenever I had the chance for a reprieve, I leapt at it. One day, I corralled some friends -- travel-happy dads like me -- for drinks at Vino Rosso, an Italian wine bar recommended by a Mission Parents member for its ''Wine &amp;Whiners'' Wednesdays, where we knocked back $4 glasses of prosecco while our children played with dishwasher-sterilized plastic toys provided by the bar. In one corner, a few moms watched us, and we felt like superstars -- responsible dads with social lives to boot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My last night in San Francisco, I got really lucky. Ms. Ferman, my AirBnB landlord, had returned from her trip and agreed to baby-sit, a simple job, as Sasha sleeps soundly from 7:30 p.m. till sunrise. Around 9 p.m., I left with Ryan -- an old friend from Shanghai -- and cruised the neighborhood, from the yuppified Beretta, where $10 buys an innovative cocktail like the Dolores Park Swizzle, to the divey, red-lighted Mission Bar, where we couldn't have spent more than $3 each on our drinks, to Nombe, an ostensibly Japanese restaurant that served Laotian tongue tacos, two for $3. They were amazing, and drizzled with a honey-habanero salsa, they were the spiciest things I'd eaten in 10 years; my mouth was still on fire when I got home. It was not even 1 a.m., but I felt like I'd been out till dawn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As I climbed into bed, careful not to disturb my sleeping daughter, I wondered what Sasha would make of the trip. Would she even remember any of it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Probably not, but then again, at her age memory is a funny thing. The specific images may fade -- however preserved in photos and videos -- but some vestigial instinct for travel may remain. Like all babies, Sasha is an explorer of new worlds, even when they're close to home, and I like to think the trip gave her a burst of confidence in her abilities. For me, I know, it certainly did.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IF YOU GO</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Numerous airlines fly nonstop from New York City area airports to San Francisco, with late-March departures starting at just under $300, according to a recent Web search.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One-, three- and seven-day passes good on all San Francisco Muni buses and cable cars are sold at the airport. BART trains between the airport and the 24th and Mission stop cost $5.10 each way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHERE TO STAY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent search on AirBnB.com found nearly 400 listings in the San Francisco area, ranging from a $23-a-night spare room in the North Beach neighborhood to a $600-a-night, six-bedroom apartment near Alamo Square. AirBnB charges an additional 6 to 12 percent service charge, depending on the cost of the rental and the length of your stay.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Everybody's Business column last Sunday, about the future of the housing market, misstated the additional amount by which Barry Ritholtz of FusionIQ, a quantitative research firm, believed home prices needed to drop in the short term in order to return to historical norms. It is 15 percent, not 50.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Sun Mar 21 2010</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''IT'S a great time to buy a home.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate agents were saying that in 2001, as home prices were rising. They also said it when home prices peaked in 2005 -- in fact, David Lereah, former chief economist of the National Association of Realtors, published a book that year titled ''Are You Missing the Real Estate Boom?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And many real estate agents said it was time to buy as prices began to drop -- and continued to say it over the past several years as prices fell by an average of 33 percent in America's 20 largest cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lereah would acknowledge that he had gotten it wrong. But from the perspective of many real estate agents, it is always a good time to buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What they are really saying is that it is a good time to be involved in a transaction that generates a commission,'' says Barry Ritholtz, C.E.O. and director of equity research at FusionIQ, a quantitative research firm. He's also author of ''The Big Picture,'' an irreverent blog on markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If agents are always motivated to make a deal, buyers are often asking an impossible question: ''Will the price of this house go up?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the National Association of Realtors said for many years that home prices historically don't fall, actually they do, and sometimes quite sharply. The housing market is complicated, and the future unknowable. Still, for clues to the overall direction of prices, Mr. Ritholtz advises buyers to look at three metrics: the ratio of median income to median home prices, which suggests whether people can afford a house; the cost of ownership versus renting; and the value of the national housing stock as a percentage of gross domestic product.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All those measures were aberrationally inflated during the housing bubble. And they still aren't back to historical norms. We can get back to the norm in either of two ways, Mr. Ritholtz says: home prices can either drop an additional 15 percent or go sideways for seven years or so, while G.D.P. and income presumably grow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To complicate matters, even if home prices rise or fall nationally, they may not follow that pattern in Las Vegas or South Florida or Maine, to say nothing of the neighborhood where you want to buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There may be a better way, however, for potential buyers to approach the problem. ''Predicting interest rates is a whole lot easier than predicting home prices,'' says Glenn Kelman, chief executive of Redfin, a multistate discount online real estate brokerage company based in Seattle. ''Before you buy the house, you buy the money,'' he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a little like walking into a dealership to buy a car, and finding the saleswoman immediately jotting down what your monthly payments will be and starting the negotiations there. That's absolutely the wrong way to buy a car. But for a prospective homeowner, it's a good place to start the analysis to determine how much house you can buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of betting on home prices, you make a bet on whether money will become cheaper or more expensive, allowing you to buy more or less house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's where the regular Joe has a pretty good shot of being right. You won't know day to day, or week to week, what's happening to rates, and a jolt like a default in Greece or a change in Chinese monetary policy can throw everything off. But, generally, the Federal Reserve is telegraphing where things are headed over the next six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I can't prove to you that housing prices have definitely bottomed out,'' Mr. Kelman says. ''I can say with a fair degree of certainty that the cost of money will go higher.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OF course, if rates go up, home prices tend to dampen. Borrowing $300,000 at 5 percent costs you $1,610 a month. If rates rise to 6 percent, that's $188 a month more, or $67,680 over 30 years. Would the price of a $375,000 house fall because of a half-point rate hike? Now you are back to guessing about home prices. Don't go there. Maintain your focus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People are frequently buying for the wrong reasons,'' says Frank LLosa, a real estate agent working in northern Virginia. In most cases, he says, they think that they are getting an income tax break or that their home is an investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He points out that a buyer of a $300,000 home would have to see the house appreciate $18,000 just to cover the commission and closing costs. Then figure in the predictable costs of maintenance, the opportunity costs of the mortgage down payment and the amount one could have saved by renting a similar place more cheaply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there are property taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In California, taxes alone can be $5,000 a year on that $300,000 house. In New Jersey, where property taxes are the highest in the nation, the extra cost can be even more. (The Star-Ledger of Newark calculated that, on average, residents in the town of Lodi pay 10 percent of their income in property taxes.) But who would have guessed that property taxes in that state would keep climbing, doubling over the course of seven years in some cases, even as home values stopped appreciating?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. LLosa thinks that many people -- including him -- would be better off renting. People ought to buy a house for what he calls ''warm and fuzzy feelings,'' but they shouldn't try to predict home prices. Nor should real estate agents, who aren't much wiser.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't think real estate professionals should be in the business of telling people when it is a great time to buy,'' he said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By MICHAEL WILSON </div><div>1154 words</div><div>14 March 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FOR sale: three-family home on a lovely and quiet block of Greenpoint, Brooklyn. Its charms include basement storage space, proximity to the subway and the Polish bakeries of Manhattan Avenue, and the makings of a quaint backyard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the Paviches -- Helena and her 33-year-old son, Michael. No, they're not neighbors. They live on the ground floor. Known in real estate parlance as ''life tenants'' or ''life estates,'' the Paviches are sort of like rent-stabilized tenants, who pay a fraction of market value, only they don't pay the fraction. You buy the building, you buy the Paviches, for life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 3,000-square-foot gray building, at 182 Kent Street, has an asking price of $799,000, but that, for obvious reasons, is negotiable. ''I have no knowledge of any offers,'' said Steven Douenias, a lawyer for the seller, Elizabeth Bednarz of West Hurley, N.Y.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That the owner and the tenant are at odds over the building -- one wants to sell it and the other wants to never leave it -- is hardly new in New York. But there is some history here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Very cold-hearted,'' fumed the tenant, Ms. Pavich. ''I cannot believe she's my sister.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their parents, Viktoria and Sergiusz Kunicki, were Polish immigrants who came to New York by way of England in the 1950s. They bought the building in 1968 for about $29,000, judging by the scrawled notation in the margin of the deed showing the amount of transfer taxes. They raised two sons and three daughters in its second-floor apartment, Ms. Pavich said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kunicki died in 1978, and Mrs. Kunicki moved upstate in the late 1990s to live with Ms. Bednarz. She died in 1998, leaving a will that would bind two of the daughters in a way deeper than blood: New York real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I give, bequeath and devise my Brooklyn residence to my daughter, Elizabeth B. Bednarz, to be hers absolutely,'' the will states. But absolutely, apparently, is in the eye of the bequeather. ''To my daughter Helena Pavich and her son, Michael Pavich, I give and bequeath the opportunity to live in an apartment in my Brooklyn residence, rent free and being responsible for their utilities only, for as long as they wish to,'' Mrs. Kunicki declared, ''taking into consideration future practical circumstances and the needs of all parties.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a decade, the arrangement worked well enough. Until January, when Ms. Bednarz put the place on the market. She would not say why, or anything else about the house or her sister: ''I have no comment on it.'' Likewise, her lawyer, Mr. Douenias, declined to discuss the situation, as did Charles Larkin, the real estate broker at Coldwell Banker LaBarca who is trying to sell the place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the tenant sister, a 59-year-old, divorced, part-time receptionist, had plenty to say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's like my mother is watching,'' Ms. Pavich, the older sister, said. ''Maybe she thought it would bring us closer together. She was always testing you, my mother.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, it seems that the only people being brought closer together are lawyers, locksmiths and police officers. After somebody slapped padlocks on the entrances to the basement Feb. 14, the Paviches said they consulted the police, fire and buildings departments, then cut them off. Six days later, ''about 7 to 10 cops were here in my house,'' Mr. Pavich said. ''She called the Police Department about me and my mom.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A police spokesman confirmed that at 12:07 p.m. on Feb. 20, officers from the 94th Precinct responded to a call of a burglary at 182 Kent Street. Since the call suggested the burglar was still in the premises, several officers came. And quickly left. ''No offense was committed,'' the police spokesman said. ''It's a dispute.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The visit from the police rattled the Paviches. ''My eyes bulged and my mind began to race in all different directions,'' said the son, who has not worked in several years and receives disability payments for what he described as mental and emotional disabilities (his mother called it attention-deficit disorder).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Paviches said Mr. Larkin, the real estate agent, had shown the building to a handful of potential buyers. He does not, generally, show the tenants. ''I took it upon myself to meet one couple,'' Ms. Pavich said. ''They were a young couple.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mother and son have spent countless hours in their living room poring over a thick folder of yellowing legal documents, including the will, and the contesting of it by other siblings who were left out entirely. The mother and son are at once worried about eviction and investigating whether they may each be entitled to a separate apartment in the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are very close, and each often finishes the other's sentences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The family is --'' Ms. Pavich began.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''-- completely destroyed,'' her only child finished.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Point of no return,'' Ms. Pavich said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''No return at all,'' Mr. Pavich said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers and real estate lawyers said life tenants were rare, especially the rent-free kind. ''You don't really own it until the person dies,'' said John O'Donnell, a lawyer in Manhattan. ''What kind of market is there for that kind of thing?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the agent's ''no comment,'' it is difficult to tell, but in each of three telephone conversations, Mr. Larkin was interrupted by callers who seemed to be inquiring about the property -- and the age of the tenant, and the amount of wiggle room on the price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Actuarial tables from the Internal Revenue Service suggest that a person age 59 will live 26.1 more years, and a 33-year-old will last to 2060. Long after the last payment on a 30-year fixed mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are still more I.R.S. tables to help a buyer determine how much to knock off the asking price based on those estimates, but in New York real estate shorthand, the math comes down to this: Who will buy a three-family house with one family already in it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though she enjoys the first floor's access to the backyard, where she once had a tomato garden, Ms. Pavich said she would be willing to move back upstairs. But the third floor, which is smaller, will not do. And though her relationship with the current landlord is fraught, she fears a sale could be worse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You know as well as I do, people wake up and say, 'Hey, how are people living here rent free?' '' she said. ''That's what worries me.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHOTOS: FAMILY TIES: Helena Pavich and her son, Michael, ''life tenants'' of a home in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, are at odds with Ms. Pavich's sister, who was bequeathed the residence, left, and now wants to sell it.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Northport</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE oldest house in this North Shore village is a dormered 1761 cottage called Skidmore House, on nearly half an acre along Main Street. When it came onto the market last year, a group of residents, past and present, worried about the possibility of a new owner's coming in and tearing it down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They were afraid,'' said Joan Gehrke, the listing broker with Daniel Gale Sotheby International's office in Northport. ''There was really no protection.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 400 of the roughly 2,700 homes in this four-square-mile village are at least a century old, according to local officials. Over the years, Ms. Gehrke said, many lovers of old houses have been drawn to this wealth of historically interesting stock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three-bedroom one-bath Skidmore House, with its Dutch front door, parlor and beehive oven in the dining room, was listed at $359,000 and recently went into contract. Its buyer appears to be planning on restoration, but among those who looked at it, Ms. Gehrke said, some were ''interested in tearing it down,'' and others were ''people who wanted to change it dramatically.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mayor, George J. Doll Jr., was barraged with letters and phone calls, urging him not to let that come to pass -- as it has before, with several other older homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Doll, 65, has lived in the village since 1954; his house dates back either to 1886 or 1905. He said he shared the wish to protect the village's heritage but pointed out that ''it would be impractical for the village to buy every house that came up for sale.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So he did what he considered the next best thing: pushed for a historic-review law that would ''protect old houses from developers'' or from owners who seek to ''expand their house but not take into consideration its historical style.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Passed last month by the Board of Trustees, the legislation requires that plans to demolish or renovate houses a century or more in age be vetted by an architectural review board. The law applies only to work that requires a permit and does not include cosmetics like changing siding, doors, windows or paint.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mayor Doll was the first to submit his house, retroactively, for review.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the years, he said, attempts at legislating protection for ''the homes that add charm and character to the village'' were often ''very restrictive.'' The first solid protection was formalized four years ago, when the village designated a historic district on Main Street, subjecting any changes within it to review board approval.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gary Blake, the chairman of the review board, said the code enacted in February provided ''parameters to judge a house whether it has architectural value'' to the village. It allows residents to apply for a historic designation preventively, to keep future buyers from embarking on renovations without first appearing before the board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At this point, however, some homes have been so radically altered that they may not be deemed historic, Mr. Blake said. Those that are declared historic are entitled to a tax break on construction for the first five years, with any increase phased in during the second five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Detractors assert that the new law impinges on property rights. William Friedman, a lawyer who lives in an 1880s boathouse with two trees growing through it, said he was running for village trustee because the new law was ''very intrusive.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In Northport the homeowner is a captain,'' Mr. Friedman said. ''They can't micromanage what we do to our houses,'' he added, attributing the charm of the village to homeowners' creativity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet Northport's rules are anything but restrictive when compared with those elsewhere in the area. In Sea Cliff, a village in the Town of Oyster Bay, about two-thirds of homes and commercial buildings predate World War II and 54 of them have been accorded village landmark status. Of those, 29 are national landmarks and designation is being weighed for 12.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eve Haim, the president of the village Landmarks Association and a board member of the Sea Cliff Landmarks Preservation Commission, says owners of houses more than 50 years old usually have to negotiate a multilevel approval process. Approvals are required not only by the commission but also by the local architectural review board. Mostly, officials have been able ''to negotiate with homeowners to maintain some sort of historic integrity,'' Ms. Haim said. ''It is hard to protect what is here without stepping on homeowners' rights, as some of them would feel.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Mr. Doll's house in Northport over the years, a wraparound porch has been replaced, a second-story tower added above the parlor's bay window, and the house extended at the back. He acknowledged that these changes might disqualify his home for state or national landmark status, but said that ''even if it's not a pure 1800s house anymore, it still has that historic appeal.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is in part, he added, because in designing alterations, he has always taken pains to respect architectural character. Moreover, ''there are very few houses built 100 years ago that don't have extensions on them,'' he said. ''I would like to know that the next person that owns it will not destroy it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His application comes up for review in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert C. Hughes is historian for the Town of Huntington, of which Northport is a part. The town has 500 homes designated as historical in six historic districts, in addition to 100 individually listed homes. Mr. Hughes said that the town had had a preservation review process in place since 1969. (Northport, as an incorporated village, is not subject to town regulation on this issue.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Historic preservation is not an impediment to livability,'' Mr. Hughes said. ''Houses grow and change over the years to meet changing needs'' for practical kitchens and large open spaces. ''Historic properties are what give the town its feel, its character,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Ms. Gehrke in Northport said the sellers of the Skidmore cottage had hoped for buyers who would ''buy it to restore it,'' and said that ''with the new historic preservation law, it ensures that will happen.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She added, ''If all the old homes were gone here, we'd be like everybody else.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IF the dates on the small signs affixed to facades are to be believed, Old Hill, a well-to-do enclave of Westport, is as unequivocally aged as its name indicates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider the chocolate-brown 1766 Colonial on Kings Highway North, among similar early-American confections, or the 1823 Federal that distinguishes Partrick Road. Even a Cape on Old Hill Road has a patina of history, its walls draped in ivy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ''hill'' part, too, seems to be borne out. In Fairfield County about 50 miles from Midtown Manhattan, Old Hill is indeed on a gentle slope, which allows prized homes to enjoy glimpses of a valley through rows of sturdy oaks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the landscape feature that most obviously asserts itself, especially in the revealing winter months, is water: ponds like Nash's and Cypress, whose glimmering edges lap the edges of yards, and other pools too small to be named, which collect behind logs until they finally find ways around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With these up-close reminders of the natural world, residents' passion for protecting local aquifers isn't surprising. Many who vehemently opposed development efforts won a significant battle in 2007 against a company called ARS Partners, forcing it to renounce its claim to almost half of a 56-acre site punctuated with wetlands along the Newtown Turnpike.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today only 3 of 13 homes planned for the remaining subdivision are built, and one is unsold, said Ralph Grasso, the owner of ARS. Opponents ''could have bought the parcel when it was available, but they never thought to do that,'' he said. ''But it was one of the last big parcels in Westport.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Preservation fights can be notably fierce. But at this point residents are savoring their victory, said one of them, Jerry Doyle, who extolled the beauty of the area's bodies of water, and pointed out that they still brimmed with wildlife like beavers, snapping turtles and fish. ''People in Westport can be outspoken,'' said Mr. Doyle, who runs a communications company in Manhattan, ''but one of the reasons we love it is that everybody is so involved.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was also drawn to the area by the golf course at Westport's Longshore Club Park. Until recently, only residents could play there -- one reason that Mr. Doyle moved here from Norwalk in 2004, even though the distance between his former and current addresses amounts to only half a mile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and his family live in a five-bedroom colonial, with three and a half baths and 4,200 square feet. They paid $875,000, and spent an additional $100,000 on renovations, including new siding. He also added a sunroom and front porch, he said, though ''I didn't remove a single tree.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT YOU'LL FIND</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Old Hill's exact borders can be a subject of disagreement. Under a generous definition, it stretches from Post Road West to Wilton Road, from Norwalk to the Saugatuck River, which means it has about 3,500 people across two and a half square miles, according to census figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Architecturally, the dominant styles are Colonial, with low saltbox-style rooflines and 12-over-12 windows, and colonial, with garages that indicate 20th-century origins. Many of the newer properties are found on dead-end private streets, some unpaved, in a town where such roads outnumber public ones, 460 to 332, according to town officials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But scattered throughout are bulging newer mansions with circular windows, enclosed wraparound porches and deep porticos, their roofs topped by whimsical glass-walled belvederes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last few years, some Old Hill residents have tried to halt construction of these homes-on-steroids by making it tougher to tear down what previously stood on their lots. In 2008, the town strengthened an ordinance to make the razing of any building at least 50 years old subject to an automatic six-month delay and to public review.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That makes it one of the strictest such measures in Fairfield County -- though the recession may have obviated some concerns of teardown foes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2009, Westport's building department issued 55 residential demolition permits, down from 94 in 2007, at the height of the housing boom. Similarly, nearby Greenwich issued 54 demolition permits in 2009 versus 164 in 2007, and New Canaan gave out 31 versus 56.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But one person's McMansion may be another's paradise. In any case, along Old Hill Road, for one, the setbacks are ample enough that new houses are framed in proportion to their size, said Andy Frank, a resident. ''There's mature landscaping here, so you have nice buffers between neighbors,'' Mr. Frank added, asserting that criticism of oversized homes should be redirected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Frank's views may not be completely representative, as his company, Andy Frank Builders, has put up four large homes in Old Hill over the last decade -- including his own, a five-bedroom colonial. ''I would like to build two-bedroom Capes,'' he said, ''but I can only build what the market dictates.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT YOU'LL PAY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although few would call Old Hill affordable, homes tend to sell for slightly less than in Westport as a whole. It is rare for a property to trade for less than $750,000, and those that do are usually 1950s ranches on half-acre lots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year 22 homes sold, for an average $1.1 million, versus $1.4 million for Westport, based on data from the Greater Fairfield County Consolidated Multiple Listing Service. Estates like those along Broadview Road are at the high end, with their guest houses and sweeping lawns. They can command more than $2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, as fewer homes changed hands and prices generally dropped, Old Hill's would-be sellers, frustrated by the market, decided to rent out instead. A crucial factor in the resulting increase in rentals, brokers say, was buyers who played along. Convinced that prices would fall further, many decided to take a breather from their searches and become renters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2009, 203 homes were rented in Westport, including many in Old Hill -- up from 170 in 2007, said Marilyn Heffers, a broker with William Raveis. Of the current crop of 11 on the market in Old Hill, the average rent is $2,800 a month. But there are fewer rentals this year, which suggests that ''buyers are feeling more comfortable,'' Ms. Heffers said. ''They waited it out and saw adjustments take place.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT TO DO</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earthplace, a 62-acre park at Old Hill's heart, has a museum-and-preschool complex that hummed with the sounds of birthday parties on a recent afternoon. On the grounds, a couple used snowshoes to traverse some of the three miles of trails. (The park also has trails of compacted stone, to accommodate wheelchairs.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Working farms are rare, but there are converted barns like the Red Barn, which serves a surf-and-turf-type menu in dining rooms hung with wagon-wheel lights and an oxen yoke. Opened in 1932, it is a Westport fixture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE SCHOOLS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even more than in comparable areas, residents cite Old Hill's public schools as a chief reason they moved in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">King's Highway Elementary School has 470 in kindergarten through fifth grade. Last year, 79 percent of fourth graders met standards in reading, 85 percent in math and 82 percent in writing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coleytown Middle School enrolls 500 students in sixth through eighth grade. Last year, 97 percent of eighth graders met goals in reading, 97 percent in math and 99 percent in writing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Staples High School, with 1,800 enrollees, SAT averages last year were 596 in reading, 608 in math and in 605 writing, versus 503, 508 and 506 statewide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another option is the Connecticut Friends School in Wilton, which plans to convert a 16-acre piece of a former Norwalk estate on the Old Hill border as a second campus. The school offers kindergarten througheighth grade to 60 students for about $19,000 a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE COMMUTE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The closest stop on the New Haven <span class="companylink">Metro-North Railroad</span> line is Westport. Each weekday morning, eight trains depart between 6 and 8; the average trip to Grand Central Terminal is 68 minutes. A monthly pass costs $308 at the station, and $301.84 online.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parking is a challenge. Of the station's 1,307 spaces, 1,030 require a permit, and the waiting list is at least four years, according to Westport's police department. But commuters can vie for day-use spaces, which cost $4.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE HISTORY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the Revolution, the British torched Danbury, then tried to march toward the Westport shore, where their ships awaited. But they were forced to detour along the path of Red Coat Road, after noticing Gen. Benedict Arnold and his forces near where Partrick Road runs today, according to Allen Raymond, the town historian.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite an impassioned speech at the triangular park on Kings Highway, Arnold couldn't rally his troops to give chase, and the British escaped.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ANYONE who has attended or visited the MacDowell Colony, the nation's oldest artists' colony, has daydreamed about owning property in Peterborough. Quaint New Englanders with clapboard exteriors and regal Federal-style homes line quiet country roads. Whitewashed steeples, covered bridges and the preserved 18th-century buildings of its downtown rise against the mountainous backdrop that characterizes the Monadnock region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The town is home to the oldest free library in the country, a 77-year-old professional producing theater and a 6,000-square-foot independent bookstore. It's easy to see why Thornton Wilder chose Peterborough as the model for his play ''Our Town.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peterborough is only 74 miles northwest of Boston, but the town is not a bedroom community. Nor is it a heavy tourist destination, barring a few weeks in the fall. It is a working town with plenty of employment in publishing, consulting and at the headquarters of Eastern Mountain Sports, the outdoor supply company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Volunteerism and active involvement in the arts, conservation and the outdoors is highly valued. ''People who buy here tend to be like minded, and even if they're weekenders, their skills are appreciated and put to good use,'' said Andrew Peterson, vice president and co-owner of the Petersons Inc., a real estate company in town.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For artists who long to live in Peterborough, historic New Englander homes in town can be found for prices that start in the mid-$200,000s. Condominiums with fireplaces, hardwood floors, sun porches and architectural character are available in the high $100,000s. Only four properties are listed for over $1 million; they each include hundreds of acres and multiple dwellings or structures. Prices from $700,000 to $900,000 are more common at the high end of the market. State property taxes are fully deductible against federal taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers said that the market in Peterborough doesn't tend to experience tremendous increases in pricing during boom times. And in slower times it doesn't dip as far either. This is a slow and gradual market that benefits from a long-term hold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the inventory in Peterborough is higher than it has been for a few years, and prices are softer. ''That makes it a good time to buy,'' Mr. Peterson said. ''But you know what they say: 'When it's a great time to buy, you can't talk anyone into it. And when it's a bad time to buy, people spend money like crazy.' ''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CRUISER made four house calls on a recent rain-soaked Tuesday. There were two happy endings and two unhappy ones, a fairly typical outcome for a typical day in the life of a bedbug-sniffing puggle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Except that there's nothing typical about this business,'' said his handler, Jeremy Ecker, 35, whose six-month-old company, the Bed Bug Inspectors, has vetted hotels, college dorms and Midtown office buildings, suburban homes, bare-bones Brooklyn rentals and tony Manhattan co-ops. (Mr. Ecker, who charges $350 for a residential inspection, is an independent inspector, meaning he has no affiliation with an exterminator, though many hire him to check a property they have treated.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Increasingly, real estate lawyers are urging buyers in contract to inspect apartments before they close, and in their advertising, many pest control companies exhort would-be tenants to ''inspect before you rent.'' And dogs like Cruiser can inspect a room in minutes, whereas lesser mammals like human beings need hours to conduct a visual inspection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bedbug-sniffing dogs, adorable yet stunningly accurate -- entomology researchers at the University of Florida report that well-trained dogs can detect a single live bug or egg with 96 percent accuracy -- are the new and furry front line in an escalating and confounding domestic war.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While experts cite a host of reasons for the upsurge, they agree on one thing: the bugs, which were mostly eradicated in this country at midcentury by now-banned pesticides like DDT but remained a constant scourge overseas, are finding their way back to the United States through an increase in global travel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in cities like New York, where neighbors are often separated only by bricks and mortar, one person's infestation is everybody's problem, since bedbugs can crawl through walls and along wiring and pipes, and hitchhike on clothing, furniture, luggage and more. In this city of 8.3 million, it seems as if everyone has a bedbug story.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just ask Gale A. Brewer, a self-appointed bedbug evangelist and a City Council member from the Upper West Side. She prodded the Mayor's office to convene a bedbug advisory committee last fall, after years of what she and others felt were woeful public policy inadequacies in the face of the relentless advances of what some have called ''the pest of the century.'' (The committee -- entomologists, civic policy experts and advocates for children, the elderly and others -- will issue its recommendations next month.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The breadth and scope of the problem has been captured anecdotally in anguished tales -- the family living in a tent outside their lovely-but-infested Long Island home, the woman in the Upper West Side one-bedroom who spent $9,500 on extermination and lived out of plastic bags, at friends' apartments, for three months -- posted on blogs like bedbugger and newyorkvsbedbugs, the likes of which have been spreading like, well, bedbugs, over the last few years. They are told over and over at community board hearings presided over by Ms. Brewer and others, and recorded in mainstream media. Another picture, though still incomplete, comes from the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, which has been tracking bedbug complaints and violations through calls to the 311 help line. Consider that six years ago, there were 537 bedbug complaints and 82 violations (in other words, verified infestations); last year, complaints topped out at nearly 11,000, with 4,084 violations cited (nearly double that of the previous year).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the complaints registered with the department and 311 relate only to rental properties; reports of bedbugs scampering through the private sanctums of hotels, co-ops and condos, colleges and office buildings remain largely uncounted, though real estate lawyers and brokers report that co-op minutes reveal a world that's just as infested as the rest of the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last three months, and for the first time in her 21-year career, for example, Lori Braverman, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, advised buyers she was representing in three deals to inspect apartments they were in contract for, having noted in the co-op boards' minutes instances of bedbugs in their buildings. ''One was described as a 'significant infestation,''' she said. ''It's the deep, dark secret of co-ops and condos.'' (All three checked out clean, including a classic five on the Upper West Side inspected by Cruiser.) Still, as Ms. Brewer said darkly, ''Those bugs are everywhere.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a day or two with Cruiser, one would have to agree.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NINE-THIRTY in the morning in Borough Park, Brooklyn, at the home of a family of seven, two of them still in diapers: the family was poised to move to a new house, their things in boxes, the rooms askew, to the horror of the mother, who had to welcome a reporter and a photographer into the pre-move disarray. (Like all the bedbug sufferers in this story, she asked not to be identified because of the stigma surrounding the pests.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cruiser had been invited because the mother had found a dead bedbug floating in the bath of one child the night before, and she wanted to make sure, if there was an infestation, that it didn't travel to their new home. The house next door had had a problem, she said, and she knew bedbugs travel easily through walls. All this was related to Mr. Ecker, while Oscar Rincon, his colleague, waited outside with Cruiser.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't want to know the details,'' Mr. Rincon said later, lest the knowledge affect his body language and interfere with the dog's inspection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rincon, 42, is an old friend of Mr. Ecker's who worked for years at the North Shore Animal League. He and Mr. Ecker, Cruiser and his partner, a beagle called Freedom, were all trained for their work at J&amp;K Canine Academy in High Springs, Fla., where rescue dogs are schooled in the scent detection of termites, bedbugs, bombs, some cancers and canker, a scourge on citrus crops. The school has an ongoing relationship with the University of Florida, which has been testing its results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In two weeks training with Cruiser and Freedom, Mr. Ecker and Mr. Rincon learned how to hide live hives of bedbugs -- little gangs of bugs tucked into vials fitted with mesh covers, so the scent can travel, but the bugs stay put -- and work with the dogs in constantly changing scenarios (hiding bugs in high cupboards, in drawers, under rugs and so forth). Like all scent-detecting dogs, Cruiser and Freedom work for food; put another way, they are fed only when they find their target, which keeps them accurate and keen on their jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This poses challenges, however, for a dog handler. Back home in Fresh Meadows, Queens, Mr. Ecker discovered pretty quickly that his new career required an extreme lifestyle commitment. Not only would he have to live with bedbugs to train and feed his new roommates, Cruiser and Freedom, he would have to feed the bugs, too. Remember that dinner for a bedbug is a nice long quaff of human blood; Mr. Ecker rolled up a sleeve to reveal a horrifying tattoo of old bites. (Bedbugs don't carry disease, but their bites can itch like crazy.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Happily, the bugs need to eat only once a month or less, he said. ''It's not so bad. You can hardly feel it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few days later at his home, Mr. Ecker demonstrated, tipping a vial of bugs onto his forearm, which the critters latched on to like hungry newborns, their bodies quickly swelling with blood. Meanwhile, Mr. Rincon was cleaning vials, ensuring that the dogs learn to detect only live bugs and eggs. He swept the debris -- bedbug feces, maybe some eggs -- into plastic cups, which he filled with water and stuck in the freezer, since extreme temperatures are proven bug snuffers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You have to be very focused,'' Mr. Ecker said. ''You can't sneeze, or answer the phone. The cat has to be out of the room. Want to try?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BACK in Borough Park, Cruiser had started to work. Mr. Rincon wiped his paws with a towel and began leading him around the house. The family's boxed possessions, stacked in the basement, were quickly vetted. But a wooden crib in a child's room gave Cruiser pause. The father turned it back to front and the dog began pawing the mattress, signaling an alert. (What Cruiser does is detect the scent of a bug or an egg; it's up to an exterminator, said Mr. Ecker, to visually confirm the presence of bedbugs in the spots a dog has noted.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mother exhaled slowly. ''That's where my 2 1/2-year-old sleeps,'' she said. She had the expression, a sort of satisfied wince, familiar to parents everywhere, when a nagging suspicion -- the toe is broken, the teeth need braces, the itchy scalp is really lice -- has been confirmed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Returning Cruiser to a crate in the back of his white Subaru Outback, Mr. Ecker, who had been in the extermination business for six years, reflected on his new career. Since he and Mr. Rincon returned from Florida in September, they've done hundreds of inspections. Despite the ick factor, ''it's very rewarding work,'' he said. ''We get to walk dogs for a living and we help people get peace of mind.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rincon added: ''We see people who literally haven't slept for weeks. They think everything is a bedbug. At a place in Jersey, the wife was a total wreck. She'd saved 15 samples of stuff, thinking it was bedbugs.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was mostly lint, as it turned out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A mother of 7-month-old twins in a bedroom community outside of New York was not so lucky. It was Cruiser's last stop of the day; after Borough Park, he'd inspected a Midtown office and an apartment in Riverdale. Both were bedbug-free, the day's happy endings. Outside the city, the rain was still coming down in sheets. A Manhattan-dwelling relative of the mother had had bedbugs, perhaps the source, she said, of her house's infestation, which she had had heat-treated, at a cost of $5,000. (Many sufferers with animals or young children choose this nontoxic method, in which very hot air is channeled into a space.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She and her husband and their young family had decamped to a hotel. Back in her pristinely renovated 19th-century brick row house a week later, however, she was convinced she was being bitten again. The woman extended a graceful bare foot with a large, angry welt on the arch. She had called the pest control company she had used, but they were backed up on inspections and couldn't promise a dog for another week. ''I can't wait that long,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Cruiser arrived, he greeted the woman by placing his paws on her knees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Does that mean I've got them?'' she wondered. ''I feel like one big bug. If I can get through this, having twins isn't going to be an issue.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cruiser spent 15 minutes at the house and alerted four times, scratching a parlor-floor loveseat, an upholstered side chair nearby, the mother's side of the bed and a small black suitcase in a closet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mother's eyes welled. ''I have to remember no one is sick, no one has cancer,'' she said. ''Is it possible, when we went to the hotel, I brought them with me and then brought them back?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's possible,'' Mr. Ecker said. ''I'm sorry.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cruiser insinuated his wet nose into the reporter's hand, and she scratched his silky ears.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in the car, she wondered: Shouldn't the mother wrap the couch, the chair and the suitcase in plastic? What about her mattress? Does the inspection mean that heat treatment doesn't work? Should the reporter, who had taken off her muddy boots in the house, throw away her socks?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ecker shook his head. ''What if I tell her to do one thing and it contradicts the pest-control company's plans?'' he said, referring to the client. ''There's nothing wrong with heat. There's more than one way to cut apples.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added: ''We've never taken a bug home with us. They're not like fleas. They don't jump on you.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bedbugs need time to get to know you, he explained. A short visit to a bedbug lair poses no risks. Still, as Mr. Rincon pointed out, ''I never sit down.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moving Them Out</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last several years, bedbug infestations have increased exponentially in New York City, but so have the resources to deal with them. The city offers a guide at nyc.gov. Bedbugger.com, a blog, is a Baedeker for treatment and a group memoir; newyorkvsbedbugs.org focuses more on city policies than remediation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Think you have bedbugs? Bites might be the first sign, but not everyone reacts the same way: on some they look like welts or hives, on others mosquito bites and some people don't react at all. Once you've met a bedbug, though, you won't mistake it for anything else. The bugs look different at each life stage: the eggs are clear and the size of a pencil point, the babies are semi-transparent and poppy seed-size and adults are rust-colored and as big as an apple seed. The city's Web site advises using an exterminator that describes itself as an ''integrated pest management'' service; make sure it is registered with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation; ( 718) 482-4994 or go to www.dec.ny.gov[http://www.dec.ny.gov].</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MITCH KAPOR, the software mogul and philanthropist, has given millions of dollars to environmental groups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Mr. Kapor wants to build a 10,000-square-foot house, complete with a 10-car garage, in Berkeley, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the house won planning approval earlier this year, many neighbors were surprised -- not so much by the size of the house, or by its sleek design, but by the fact that, under Berkeley regulations, the house will qualify as ''green.'' In Berkeley, building proposals are evaluated on a ''green point'' scale, earning credit for such eco-conscious features as low-flow shower heads and insulation. A house with more than 60 points is labeled green, regardless of its size.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gary Earl Parsons, a Berkeley architect and a member of that city's Landmarks Preservation Commission, called the designation of the Kapor house as green ''absurd.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That the staff, the owners and the architects indulge in this kind of greenwashing only serves to make a joke out of Berkeley's environmental aspirations,'' Mr. Parsons wrote on the Berkeleyside blog.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greg Powell, the city's senior planner assigned to the project, defended the point system. ''True, the greenest house is the house you don't build,'' he said. ''But we assume people are going to build new homes, and we encourage them to make them better.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the system's failure to account for size enrages some environmentalists, who note that a 10,000-square-foot house is likely to require four times the resources of the average new American house, which, according to the Census Bureau, is under 2,500 square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an appeal of the Kapor decision to the city's Zoning Adjustments Board, a group of neighbors, including Susan and Chuck Fadley, who live about 200 yards from where the Kapors hope to build, wrote that ''green building begins with using 'just enough' and preserving what already exists. Clearly the idea of 'just enough' is not part of the design concept.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Donn Logan, Mr. Kapor's architect, wrote in an e-mail message that he and Mr. Kapor, the founder of <span class="companylink">Lotus Development Corp</span>., were too busy to respond to questions. But Mr. Logan, of the firm Marcy Wong Donn Logan Architects, said it is unfair to describe the house as having 10,000 square feet; its living area is 6,500 square feet. (The garage accounts for 3,500 square feet.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Logan said the Web site of the Mitchell Kapor Foundation, MKF.org, offered proof of Mr. Kapor's commitment to environmental causes. The foundation has given grants to dozens of environmental programs in California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the controversy over whether a large house can be green has implications far beyond the wooded lot on Rose Street, where Mr. Kapor and his wife, Freada Kapor Klein, the founder of the Level Playing Field Institute, a nonprofit that promotes fairness in educational and workplace settings, hope to live.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, some 10,000 buildings have been certified by the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program of the United States Green Building Council.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like Berkeley's green designation, LEED certification relies on a point system. Buildings get credit for specific eco-friendly features, some of which can be rewarded with tax credits or abatements. The LEED for Homes system ''reallocates'' points if a house is much larger than average, according to Scot Horst, the green building council's vice president for LEED. But that reallocation doesn't prevent very large homes from achieving LEED designations, he said, so long as they include enough green features.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In other parts of the world, there are government mandates for building performance,'' Mr. Horst said. ''But we don't do that in the United States.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">William H. Harrison, an Atlanta architect with a stable of wealthy clients, said penalizing people for building large houses could slow the adoption of green building practices. ''The people who can afford the green technologies are going to want large houses,'' he said. And those innovations, he said, will trickle down to smaller houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Harrison said that one of his clients is planning to build a 25,000-square-foot house in Los Angeles. But he opted out of the LEED system, Mr. Harrison said, when he learned that it was virtually impossible to get the highest LEED rating, known as platinum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He's a billionaire, and he drives a Prius, for God's sake,'' said Mr. Harrison of his client. ''He wants to do the right thing, environmentally. And now he's being told, 'You're not good enough, because your house is too big.' ''That, Mr. Harrison said, ''is about socialism, not sustainability.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Harrison said he is working on a 50,000-square-foot house in Kiev, Ukraine. The project, he said, ''is going to employ 5,000 people for three years. All those people will have jobs, and feed their families. Should I tell my client not to build it? Or should I participate -- try to make it as green as possible? The answer is, I should do what I'm doing. I don't feel guilty at all.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jim Nicolow, the director of sustainability at Lord, Aeck &amp;Sargent, an architecture firm with offices in Atlanta; Ann Arbor, Mich., and Chapel Hill, N.C., credited LEED with making sustainability a part of the discussion between architects and clients. But, he said, ''there are a lot of problems with the system.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For architects, Mr. Nicolow said, there is a constant question of whether to take a bad project and try to make it better. ''I don't fault the architect for making a living,'' he said. ''If you get a project, you tend to take the project.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Berkeley's green point system was developed by a nonprofit group called Built It Green and adopted by the city government. Items on the checklist include: tightly seal the air barrier between the garage and living area; insulate hot water pipes; use Forest Stewardship Council-certified wood; use paint low in volatile organic compounds. About 70 local governments in California have ordinances based on the Build It Green checklist, according to Bruce Mast, an executive of the organization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan for the Kapors' house received 91 points, 31 more than required for a green designation in Berkeley. Before the couple can start building, they will have to demolish an existing 2,500-square-foot house on the site and cut down mature trees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the site of the Kapor house is so large, said Mr. Powell of Berkeley, that even with a very big house, the percentage of the lot that is covered will be low for the area. And, he said, they are proposing the 10-car garage not because they have a lot of cars, but because neighbors expressed concern about on-street parking. They're addressing the issue ''on their own nickel,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the decision to approve the house has been appealed, the city council will review the case in April, Mr. Powell said. The council, he said, could approve the application, set a hearing date or remand the case to the zoning board for reconsideration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However the Kapor case is decided, it could lead to changes in the checklist approach used in Berkeley and elsewhere. In their appeal to the board, residents proposed a modification to the ''green point'' system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the house is at least the size of three typical houses, they wrote, ''the 91 green points earned should really be divided by three, yielding a score of 30.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is far below the number required for a green designation.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a four-month battle between the auction giants <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> and Christie's, the art collection of the Los Angeles philanthropist Frances Lasker Brody will be sold at Christie's in New York in May. Valued at well over $150 million, it includes a 1932 painting by Picasso that is considered a seminal work from one of the high points of that artist's career. Also coming to auction are rare examples by Giacometti, Matisse and Braque.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christie's was able to wrest the collection from <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> by offering the estate a guarantee, an undisclosed sum promised to the sellers regardless of the outcome of the sale. Since the economy tanked in 2008, the auction houses have for the most part stopped offering sellers such financial incentives. It is believed that a third party has helped finance this guarantee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because Mrs. Brody was passionate about gardens, some of the sale's proceeds are to go to the Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens in San Marino, Calif., where she was on the board of overseers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Brody, who died in November at 93, was the wife of Sidney F. Brody, a real estate developer who died in 1983, and the stepdaughter of Mary Lasker, a philanthropist and champion of medical research who died in 1994. The Brodys lived in a modernist house in the Holmby Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles that was designed by the architect A. Quincy Jones and the decorator William Haines to show off the couple's collection. Matisse created a 12-by-11-foot ceramic-tile mural for their courtyard that is being donated to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''While this is the last gasp of collecting of this type, it is a little tougher-edged than the Park Avenue collections that were put together at the same time,'' said Christopher Burge, honorary chairman of Christie's in America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Picasso, ''Nu au Plateau de Sculpteur (Nude, Green Leaves and Bust),'' is the jewel of the collection and is expected to bring more than $80 million. Painted in rich blues, pinks and greens, it depicts the artist's mistress Marie-Therese Walter asleep naked; above her, a bust of her head rests on a pedestal. The couple bought the painting from Paul Rosenberg, a New York dealer, who acquired it from Picasso in 1936.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Picasso painted several canvases of Marie-Therese Walter that year, including ''Le Reve,'' (''The Dream''), which belongs to the casino owner Stephen A. Wynn. In 2006, Mr. Wynn had agreed to sell the painting to the hedge fund billionaire Steven A. Cohen for $135 million, until Mr. Wynn accidentally put his elbow through the painting, leaving a sizable hole that has since been repaired, and Mr. Cohen backed out of the sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another highlight of the Brody collection is ''Grande Tete de Diego,'' a bust of Giacometti's brother conceived in 1954 that is expected to bring $25 million to $35 million.</p>

</div><div class="author">By DAVID STREITFELD </div><div>1224 words</div><div>8 March 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an effort to end the foreclosure crisis, the Obama administration has been trying to keep defaulting owners in their homes. Now it will take a new approach: paying some of them to leave.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This latest program, which will allow owners to sell for less than they owe and will give them a little cash to speed them on their way, is one of the administration's most aggressive attempts to grapple with a problem that has defied solutions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than five million households are behind on their mortgages and risk foreclosure. The government's $75 billion mortgage modification plan has helped only a small slice of them. Consumer advocates, economists and even some banking industry representatives say much more needs to be done.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the administration, there is also the concern that millions of foreclosures could delay or even reverse the economy's tentative recovery -- the last thing it wants in an election year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taking effect on April 5, the program could encourage hundreds of thousands of delinquent borrowers who have not been rescued by the loan modification program to shed their houses through a process known as a short sale, in which property is sold for less than the balance of the mortgage. Lenders will be compelled to accept that arrangement, forgiving the difference between the market price of the property and what they are owed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We want to streamline and standardize the short sale process to make it much easier on the borrower and much easier on the lender,'' said Seth Wheeler, a Treasury senior adviser.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem is highlighted by a routine case in Phoenix. Chris Paul, a real estate agent, has a house he is trying to sell on behalf of its owner, who owes $150,000. Mr. Paul has an offer for $48,000, but the bank holding the mortgage says it wants at least $90,000. The frustrated owner is now contemplating foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To bring the various parties to the table -- the homeowner, the lender that services the loan, the investor that owns the loan, the bank that owns the second mortgage on the property -- the government intends to spread its cash around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the new program, the servicing bank, as with all modifications, will get $1,000. Another $1,000 can go toward a second loan, if there is one. And for the first time the government would give money to the distressed homeowners themselves. They will get $1,500 in ''relocation assistance.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Should the incentives prove successful, the short sales program could have multiple benefits. For the investment pools that own many home loans, there is the prospect of getting more money with a sale than with a foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the borrowers, there is the likelihood of suffering less damage to credit ratings. And as part of the transaction, they will get the lender's assurance that they will not later be sued for an unpaid mortgage balance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For communities, the plan will mean fewer empty foreclosed houses waiting to be sold by banks. By some estimates, as many as half of all foreclosed properties are ransacked by either the former owners or vandals, which depresses the value of the property further and pulls down the value of neighboring homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If short sales are about to have their moment, it has been a long time coming. At the beginning of the foreclosure crisis, lenders shunned short sales. They were not equipped to deal with the labor-intensive process and were suspicious of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lenders' thinking, said the economist Thomas Lawler, went like this: ''I lend someone $200,000 to buy a house. Then he says, 'Look, I have someone willing to pay $150,000 for it; otherwise I think I'm going to default.' Do I really believe the borrower can't pay it back? And is $150,000 a reasonable offer for the property?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Short sales are ''tailor-made for fraud,'' said Mr. Lawler, a former executive at the mortgage finance company <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, short sales started to increase, although they remain relatively uncommon. <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> said preforeclosure deals on loans in its portfolio more than tripled in 2009, to 36,968. But real estate agents say many lenders still seem to disapprove of short sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the new federal program, a lender will use real estate agents to determine the value of a home and thus the minimum to accept. This figure will not be shared with the owner, but if an offer comes in that is equal to or higher than this amount, the lender must take it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Paul, the Phoenix agent, was skeptical. ''In a perfect world, this would work,'' he said. ''But because estimates of value are inherently subjective, it won't. The banks don't want to sell at a discount.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are myriad other potential conflicts over short sales that may not be solved by the program, which was announced on Nov. 30 but whose details are still being fine-tuned. Many would-be short sellers have second and even third mortgages on their houses. Banks that own these loans are in a position to block any sale unless they get a piece of the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You have one loan, it's no sweat to get a short sale,'' said Howard Chase, a Miami Beach agent who says he does around 20 short sales a month. ''But the second mortgage often is the obstacle.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Major lenders seem to be taking a cautious approach to the new initiative. In many cases, big banks do not actually own the mortgages; they simply administer them and collect payments. J. K. Huey, a <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> vice president, said a short sale, like a loan modification, would have to meet the requirements of the investor who owns the loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is not an opportunity for the customer to just walk away,'' Ms. Huey said. ''If someone doesn't come to us saying, 'I've done everything I can, I used all my savings, I borrowed money and, by the way, I'm losing my job and moving to another city, and have all the documentation,' we're not going to do a short sale.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even if lenders want to treat short sales as a last resort for desperate borrowers, in reality the standards seem to be looser.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sree Reddy, a lawyer and commercial real estate investor who lives in Miami Beach, bought a one-bedroom condominium in 2005, spent about $30,000 on improvements and ended up owing $540,000. Three years later, the value had fallen by 40 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Reddy wanted to get out from under his crushing monthly payments. He lost a lot of money in the crash but was not in default. Nevertheless, his bank let him sell the place for $360,000 last summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A short sale provides peace of mind,'' said Mr. Reddy, 32. ''If you're in foreclosure, you don't know when they're ultimately going to take the place away from you.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Reddy still lives in the apartment complex where he bought that condo, but is now a renter paying about half of his old mortgage payment. Another benefit, he said: ''The place I'm in now is nicer and a little bigger.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TO walk the streets of Brownsville and East New York, Brooklyn, is to see neighborhoods ravaged by foreclosure, homes boarded up and marshals' notices taped to doors. Yet in the midst of this pain sit several swaths of well-tended homes, about 3,000 in all, each with a driveway and statuary and garden. Not one of their owners has lost a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five miles away in Jamaica, Queens, another neighborhood hammered by foreclosures, there remain blocks where not one house has been put up for auction in the current crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stroll around Soundview in the Bronx, or Windsor Terrace and Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn, and the pattern becomes clear. Of more than 60,000 New York homes built or rehabilitated by the city in partnership with nonprofit groups like Nehemiah and Neighborhood Housing Services over three decades, fewer than 1 percent have fallen into foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a hidden-in-plain-sight success story: these alliances have sidestepped the plague of foreclosure by delivering homes to working-class families in a distinctly traditional manner. The Department of Housing Preservation and Development and nonprofit groups created sturdy, affordable homes. Counselors screened credit histories and required that applicants attend ownership classes, put cash down and obtain prime-loan mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you didn't have good credit, you were out -- it was old-fashioned,'' recalled Zandra Brockman, 52, who bought one of the Nehemiah homes in East New York for $68,500 in 1999. ''They didn't want to sell you a home and have you lose everything.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Congress debates the causes of the nation's housing calamity, many Republicans have accused Democrats of promoting homeownership at any cost, pressuring banks and federal agencies to issue mortgages, no matter how exotic the lending terms or how shaky the applicants' finances. Even some advocates for moderate-income subsidized housing have acknowledged that ownership mania swept the country in the last 15 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In these New York neighborhoods, both liberal and some conservative analysts see a model for bringing low- and middle-income workers, many of them black and Latino, back into the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They have recapitulated the elements of healthy, working-class neighborhoods -- it's back to the future,'' said Howard Husock, a vice president for social research at the conservative Manhattan Institute. ''Learning to save and building up credit is a prelude to becoming a good homeowner.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In their aversion to risk, the city and the nonprofit groups have behaved like small-town bankers. They refuse to let pinched owners overextend with home-equity loans. And the city demands the right to review refinancing requests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One lady wrote a thousand letters to the mayor complaining about us,'' recalled Denise Scott, managing director of the New York office of the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, which has financed close to 400 subsidized one- to-four-family homes without a single foreclosure. ''We refused to accept her argument that she could own a house without showing us proof of income. Sorry.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A tally by the city's housing agency shows that of 20,614 such homes sold since 2004, only 13 have gone through foreclosure auctions. Among 3,900 Nehemiah homes built since the 1980s, organizers know of no foreclosures. ''We continue to see an almost nonexistent default rate,'' said Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, whose housing arm has helped finance tens of thousands of one-to-three-family homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This, despite the fact that the homes are mainly in neighborhoods like East New York, where lenders filed 1,051 foreclosure notices last year, or Jamaica, where 759 houses were scheduled for foreclosure auctions, according to the nonprofit Center for New York Neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While New York's commitment over several decades to producing hundreds of thousands of subsidized apartments and houses is without parallel in the nation, other cities have begun similar programs -- with similarly low foreclosure rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neighborhood Housing Services has produced tens of thousands of affordable homes, scattered among virtually all of the nation's large cities. The group that formed Nehemiah has also built 140 homes in Washington in the last few years. And Enterprise Community Partners, a nonprofit group based in Columbia, Md., has helped finance 15,000 to 20,000 homes for moderate-income buyers across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Homeownership is not for everyone,'' said Mark McDermott, an Enterprise vice president. ''We require counseling and down payments -- we want homeowners to have some skin in the game.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such housing requires a substantial infusion of public money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In East New York, the city donated hundreds of acres of public land to Nehemiah and provided some construction financing. Elsewhere, city officials and large nonprofit agencies extended construction and mortgage financing to thousands of families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In return, these projects often create neighborhoods where none have existed for decades, and they can be fiercely independent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Organizers at East Brooklyn Congregations declined a state agency's offer to provide low-interest loans for down payments in East New York. They preferred that each buyer scrape up the cash -- usually $7,000 to $12,000, including closing costs. (The first Nehemiah homes in the 1980s sold for about $39,000; more recently built ones have sold for up to $158,000.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We don't want people who view ownership as a 'mental rental,' '' an obligation too easily discarded, said Michael Gecan, a senior organizer for Metro Industrial Areas Foundation, which did much of the work that led to the Nehemiah homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York officials never fell for the romance of homeownership. Sixty percent of city residents rent, compared with 40 percent in the rest of the nation. And that, said Rafael E. Cestero, the city's housing commissioner, allowed the city and nonprofit groups to be picky about who could buy a subsidized home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We didn't have this drive to get every single person, no matter their income, no matter their credit, into a house,'' Mr. Cestero said. ''We frown upon exotic mortgages.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet New York's nonprofit housing sector cannot stand sheltered from the national economic storm. Unemployment in the city stands at 10.4 percent, and nonprofit counselors report that more and more homeowners have lost their jobs and are at risk of losing their homes. Bank officials who have worked with the nonprofit groups have grown wary, and are reluctant to lend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For that reason, sales of new subsidized homes have slowed dramatically, and many stand vacant for months before selling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the credit scores of working-class New Yorkers have tumbled. Two decades ago, Mr. Gecan said, one in three applicants for a Nehemiah home had a credit score that qualified them for a mortgage; now, it is one in eight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of this came as news to Ms. Brockman, a financial analyst who lives alone and stood at the door of her handsome modest home on Hinsdale Street in East New York. A harsh wind was blowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You heard things these past years on TV and radio, where they say income doesn't matter, down payments don't matter,'' she said. ''You say to yourself, 'How could they sell them a home knowing the homeowner could not afford it?' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She shook her head and unfastened her gate. ''Nehemiah had no time for that here,'' she said. ''We wanted to build a community.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IT seemed like a smart idea at the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment was lovely -- new construction, three bedrooms, three and a half baths, nearly 2,000 square feet on the Upper East Side. The asking price was $2.995 million. A year earlier it would have gone fast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this was early 2009 and the economy was in tatters. Offers were pathetic -- the best, $2.2 million. Forget it, the owners said. We'll rent the place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so they did. With the approval of the condominium board, a family signed a one-year lease for $10,500 a month, with an option to renew for a second year. The owner's expenses were covered. The plan was working nicely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Except now the buyer who offered $2.2 million has come back -- this time with an offer of $2.83 million, all cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They're coming up almost to asking price, but I can't get the renter out,'' sighed Victoria Shtainer, a senior vice president of Prudential Douglas Elliman, the real estate company. She is holding her breath until April, when she will hear whether the tenants intend to exercise their option to extend the lease for another year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past year or two, many owners who couldn't sell -- or didn't dare try -- made a similar calculation. Rather than accept an impossibly low offer (if they even had an offer), they decided to rent out their properties. The idea was to cover expenses while waiting for the market to right itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in recent months, a number of these accidental landlords have been surprised to find renewed buyer interest in their properties. The problem is, the renters are happily in place. And that can complicate showings -- let alone negotiating an actual deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 4,100-square-foot loft on East 24th Street has sat on the market for nearly two years, despite a drop in price to $3.995 million in July 2009, from $5.535 million in April 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September 2008, the owners put the place up for rent. When their tenant moved out last summer, with no buyers in sight, they decided to rent it again, though this time the best monthly price they could get was a few thousand dollars lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then last fall, shortly after the new tenant moved in, the long dry spell ended and brokers started showing up with prospective buyers in tow. Now a buyer wants to make an offer, said Gina Tramontano, the exclusive agent and a vice president of Halstead Property. But he's saying that he will wait until the fourth quarter of the year -- after the lease expires.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Tramontano said the buyer had not explained his reason for holding back. But she observed, ''Once buyers hear there is a tenant, they are always concerned that the tenant won't leave.'' And that is even though the loft's lease has a rider saying the owner can request that the tenant move out, with two months' notice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are other frustrations. Whenever Ms. Tramontano wants to show the apartment, she has to have the permission of the tenants, who are not as motivated as owners to keep it in museumlike shape for viewing. When she arrives with clients, there's often a wife, a baby and a nanny at home -- and the corresponding toys and other evidence of family life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least she can show the place. A 19th-century seven-bedroom house in New Canaan, Conn., having failed to sell, has been occupied by a renter since Oct. 1. The lease contains a 90-day ''show clause,'' which means the house can't be shown to prospective buyers until July 1 -- 90 days before the lease expires.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was not a problem when prospective buyers were nonexistent. But recently brokers have inquired about the property on behalf of two clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I explained to them that you can buy it with the tenant in place until Oct.1, and I can give you photographs and detailed information about it,'' said Mary Higgins, an associate broker at Halstead, who has the exclusive on the property. ''But what I can't do is open the door and let you see it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They say, 'Well, if I'm still in the market in a few months ... ' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The renewed interest in such properties is one indication that the New York area residential real estate market may be starting to stir. But indicators of the market's health are still mixed. The number of condo and co-op sales in Manhattan was up 8.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared with the fourth quarter of 2008, and it was 10.9 percent higher than the number of sales in the third quarter of 2009, according to a report prepared by Miller Samuel, the real estate appraisal firm, for Prudential Douglas Elliman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But prices are still slipping. The median sales price in the fourth quarter ($810,000) represented a 4.7 percent drop from the third quarter and was down 10 percent from the fourth quarter of 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outside of the city, sales numbers for January show signs of life, according to newly released statistics from the New York State Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Westchester County, for example, sales of single-family houses jumped 108 percent in January compared with January 2009. The median sale price during that time rose 12.7 percent. In Suffolk County, the number of sales grew 47.6 percent from January 2009 to January 2010. The median sales price, however slipped 0.8 percent during that time -- though that was a vast improvement over the 15.7 percent drop from January 2008 to January 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When renters and prospective buyers are involved, the situation is delicate. No owner or broker interviewed for this article would disclose the identity of renters or ask them if they would speak to a reporter. That's because no one wants to upset a renter. Many owners are hoping their tenants will decline to renew their leases and leave. The last thing an owner wants is to have to pay them off in order to negotiate a deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Renting out an apartment may be a good way to keep the cash flowing, but there are roadblocks for owners to consider. Most co-op boards have strict rules about subletting, and some do not allow it at all. Condo boards are typically more lenient. And once renters are in place, it can be difficult to remove them, even if they stop paying rent. In New York City, you cannot evict a tenant without going to court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some cases, an ensconced tenant can be an amenity. Megan McGinn, an agent at Elika Associates, a firm that represents buyers in Manhattan and Brooklyn, says many of her prospective buyers are renters, with leases of their own to finish out. These buyers would welcome a tenant in place while they wait for their own leases to be up. ''A lot of buyers seem to be coming out of the woodwork right now,'' she said, adding that many had been inspired by the federal tax credit for first-time buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some owners are working to turn their renters into buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Gladstone is the sole managing member of Madison Equities, the developer of the Chelsea Modern, a condominium completed on West 18th Street in fall 2008. In the depths of the summer doldrums last year, he did something he had never done before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With about 30 of the building's 47 units sold and the market looking sluggish, he decided to rent out 12 units for a year or 13 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He believed that once someone moved into the building they would have an impulse to say, 'This feels like home to me' and have the impulse to stay,'' said Dan Tubb, Chelsea Modern's director of sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To nurse that impulse along, Mr. Gladstone moved into the building and invited renters and owners to his apartment for a holiday party.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We wanted the buyers to interact with the renters,'' Mr. Tubb said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pressing further, the developer sent a letter to all the renters in January offering a deal -- and doing the math to help them see its appeal. Renters were paying $6,500 a month for atwo-bedroom two-bath apartment with 1,400 square feet of space. Mr. Gladstone offered the unit at a 10 percent discount from the original asking price, which dropped the price tag to $1.75 million. With 70 percent financing at current rates, the monthly mortgage payments should be about $6,300 a month. The common charge for the building is about $1,200 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the tax savings -- including the mortgage interest deduction on the federal income tax and local homeowner tax relief programs -- would effectively bring an owner's net monthly payment to about $5,100, according to the letter. That would mean monthly savings of more than $1,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The numbers seemed to get some attention. Four or five renters have inquired about buying, Mr. Tubb said. (But he would not make any available to speak about their thinking process.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For some owners, the sudden interest in their properties is creating a tricky new question: Do you really want the renters out, or should you keep them even longer in hopes of getting an even better offer?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Karin Posvar-Picket, a senior vice president of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, represents a client who rejected a couple of lowball offers on his East Side condo and decided to rent his place out instead. Now, with the lease almost up, he has new offers -- but he would rather keep the renters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He wants to wait another year till the market really improves,'' Ms. Posvar-Picket said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wladimir Singer put his three-bedroom condo in the East 70s on the market for sale or rent when he moved to Monaco last spring. There were no nibbles from buyers, but the apartment rented fairly easily, with a family signing a one-year lease at $10,000 a month -- almost enough, Mr. Singer said, to cover the mortgage and other costs of carrying the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But since the start of the year, three offers have come in, including an all-cash one for $2.8 million from a major bank shopping for its corporate officers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have five to seven parties visiting the apartment each week now,'' said Mr. Singer, who had not expected to receive any offers before his tenant's lease expired. ''Sometime after the holidays the interest spiked.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All that interest has got Mr. Singer thinking: What if he waits even longer? Maybe he could get asking price ... or higher. He will learn in April if the tenants want to extend the lease for another year. If they don't, he said, he will seriously consider the offers he has.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or he might look for another renter.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE side-by-side oceanfront plots at the Montauk Shores condominium park are steps from the prime surfing at Ditch Plains Beach. One sliver holds a vintage trailer, known as the ''green monster,'' that is on the market for $495,000. The other has an unheated 300-square-foot cottage, with one bedroom and a sleeping loft, listed at $635,000. Peter Moore, an agent at <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, who with his wife, Lois, listed the properties, suggested that, with warmer weather in the offing, they should be snapped up together, by ''somebody that loves to surf'' -- and with deep pockets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The caveat, in this low-key mobile-home park of 199 trailer-condos interspersed with a few stick-built shacks on 1,000 feet of Atlantic shoreline, is that the structures cannot be replaced by the palatial digs more often associated with the East End.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You could put in what they refer to as a 'double wide,' '' with two bedrooms, two baths, a living room and kitchen, Mr. Moore said. ''You have to roll it in; by the rules, anything that comes into the park now has to come in on wheels.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or you could renovate. As for the green monster, he added, some builders and architects ''would love to line it with teak wood,'' though a redo might cost more than a replacement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nassau County lost its last trailer park in 2007, when the Syosset Mobile Home Park was sold to a developer. But by any reckoning, Suffolk remains hospitable to them. According to the New York Housing Association, the county has 39 ''manufactured home communities,'' in Calverton, Bohemia, Bay Shore, Amityville and Holbrook among other places. The two listings at Montauk Shores are among 27 coveted oceanfront properties.. Though gated, the mobile-home community -- with its clubhouse, adult and children's swimming pools, playground, basketball and horseshoe courts, and bingo in season -- has a distinctly un-Hamptons ambience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is a funky property and it is attracting all sorts,'' Mr. Moore said, including ''models and actresses'' whom he declined to name. In 2007, he said, Paul Morrissey used proceeds from the $27.5 million sale of the nearby estate he had shared with Andy Warhol to buy two units in the park. And last year, even though Thomas and Elizabeth Quinn weren't quite ready to list the cottage where they had summered for 46 years -- the one now offered at $635,000 -- their reluctance didn't stop the singer-songwriter Jimmy Buffett from expressing a strong interest in buying it. His offer of $500,000 in cash was turned down, said Ms. Quinn, 77.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The view is a million-dollar view,'' she added. Sleeping in the cabin is like being ''on a boat -- the ocean is right outside. You hear it and you feel it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet it is affordability, rather than ocean views, that motivates many of the 10,000 retirees and low-income families in the county who live in mobile homes, said Joseph Kummer, a Calverton resident and president of the Mobile Manufactured Homeowners Association of Suffolk. ''Mobile-home parks are a blessing to the seniors and the young families that don't have two incomes or don't have high incomes,'' Mr. Kummer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Multiple Listing Service of Long Island lists 50 mobile homes from $10,000 to $125,000 in Riverhead. In Amityville, where trailer parks face one another across Route 110, 13 units are listed; the price range is $13,000 to $60,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Linda Walsh, an agent with Carriage House Realty, has a listing for a $179,900 three-bedroom mobile home on a 60-by-120-foot lot, one of almost 30 on the market in the Bunker Hill and Valley Forge parks in Bohemia. ''It is just as nice or even nicer than living in a co-op or condo,'' she said. The Connetquot School District is a draw, but sales are hampered because ''mobile homes are harder to finance,'' Ms. Walsh said. As residents don't own the land their trailers sit on, they are not eligible for mortgages and must rely on conventional loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for Montauk Shores, it was converted to condos in 1976, according to its Web site, montaukshoresresort.com. All but 47 of its units are condos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Thurm's Estates, an 84-acre mobile-home park in Calverton for ages 55 and over, Patty Benko, the park manager, said that last fall residents of the 325 mobile homes were given the option to buy their units as co-ops. Negotiations continue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kummer, 81, has for 18 years owned a two-bedroom at Thurm's with a Florida room, a deck and ''a shed with vinyl siding to match the house.'' But he points out that if those who rent continue to face increases, they ''won't be able to afford it.'' Some trailers have already been scrapped, and lots emptied, for that reason. (Rental fees also cover sewage, garbage pickup and taxes.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joan Traynor, an agent with Century 21 Sterling, has 14 listings at Thurm's. The $75,000 asking price to go co-op was ''an impossible dream'' for many on fixed incomes, she said, adding that some residents were already walking away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But at Montauk Shores, the Quinns are leaving only reluctantly. The enclave, now zoned as a resort, was a shorefront campground when it opened about 65 years ago, Ms. Quinn recalled. Some residents pitched tents and strung clotheslines, while others rented cabooses and bungalows; there were communal showers. Eventually indoor plumbing, paved roads and street lighting made their appearance. And the place became more and more like home. ''We spent our whole summers there,'' she said, ''from the day school ended to the day before it started.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of April 21, Mr. Jaccom, 54, will become the chief executive of the tristate hub of Colliers International, a full-service commercial real estate brokerage company that recently announced a merger with FirstService Real Estate Advisors, including FirstService Williams. Mr. Jaccom was the chief executive of FirstService Williams.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Last week Mark Boisi, the chairman of the New York region of the new Cassidy Turley and your competitor, was interviewed. He says, ''Good luck,'' you're ''going to have a noble competitor.'' Any response?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A I wish Mark all the luck in the world. I have nothing negative to say. I have lots of friends there. What's interesting about this industry, Stephen Siegel of <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span> is my competitor, Bruce Mosler of Cushman and Wakefield, Peter Riguardi of <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> and Michael Colacino of Studley. But we're all friendly -- we see each other on the outside, we talk about family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Mr. Boisi, too?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Mark was never really someone I was friendly with. Early on, when First Service was trying to acquire <span class="companylink">GVA Williams</span>, one of the concepts was that we take his company, Colliers ABR, and us and put us together. We went through the process of trying to make it happen. And it wasn't egos, it was just different paths.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Why the merger with Colliers?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A First Service needed an organization that has a larger footprint, more disciplines. They wanted an organization that could blend with their brokers. We're now the third-largest company, behind Jones Lange and CB; we have 480 offices in 61 countries with over 15,000 employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Will having the Colliers name open many new doors for you?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A For us it's huge. I'll give you an example: There's a landlord in New York -- I can't give you the name -- that just got a couple million square feet. We helped with the transaction. About nine weeks ago, he's about to select an agent, and he said, ''I got to be quite frank with you, my foreign people don't know who FirstService Williams is, and I'm going to have a hard time selling it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two weeks ago, since we now got the name, even though officially it's April 1st, I met with the gentleman and said to him, ''We're now Colliers International, and we have an office where you are in your homeland.'' He called me a couple days later and said, ''Now you can compete.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Are you getting calls from brokers looking for jobs?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Yes. The Colliers name has the cachet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Are you expanding?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A We're in expansion mode. We manage and are leasing agents for about 20 million square feet. What we are planning to do over the next five years -- and it's a tall order -- is double that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We have, in total, between Connecticut, New Jersey and New York, 120 brokers. Our growth plan has us hiring 30 brokers over the next 18 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Who are your biggest clients?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A We represent Olympic Tower Associates/Onassis Foundation, Transwestern Investment, Citibank, <span class="companylink">PricewaterhouseCoopers</span>/Lloyds Banking, Verizon, the Rosen family; we represent Tower 49, owned by Kato International. The firm represents the Salvation Army. HIP, ADP, <span class="companylink">Google</span>. And we just did a deal with the N.B.A. for 153,000 square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q What are the occupancy rates for the buildings you manage?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A It varies. Tower 49, for example, is 2 percent vacant. At the Onassis foundation, there's probably, out of 600,000 square feet, a floor available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q How do you attract tenants?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Through creativity and flexibility. Anybody can lower the rent and throw more concessions. You have to be flexible enough to give a tenant the right to give back space if necessary. Otherwise they will not commit. So we educated our landlords early enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Do you see the brokerage industry contracting even more?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A There's one more deal out there. One of the Big Four is going to grab another company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q According to local real estate folklore, you all but threw yourself on an airplane to sign a client. Fact or fiction?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Who told you that story?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twenty years ago, I was a Long Island broker, and it was tough to break into the New York market, so I got out there and got to know a lot of people. I became close to an assistant to the president of a big insurance company that was looking for 300,000 square feet. Every broker was going after this person. I learned the president would be traveling down to Florida and that there was an empty seat right next to this person. I took the three-hour flight and struck up a conversation about real estate. A few months later I was hired as a consultant.</p>

</p><div>LIVING IN VINEGAR HILL, BROOKLYN</div>
<div>Real Estate Desk; SECTRE</div>
<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">The Little Town That Prices (Almost) Forgot</span>
</div><div class="author">By JEFF VANDAM </div><div>1623 words</div><div>7 March 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE Brooklyn waterfront, once upon a time, was seen as a place where artists and artisans lived and worked, basking in cheap rents, old architecture and a sweet sense of isolation. But lately that reality has changed. Market-rate condominium towers and luxury conversions dot the Kings County coastline, their presence telegraphing a need for a higher income bracket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet in Vinegar Hill, a hamlet within New York City if there ever was one, the old ambience is mostly intact. Nudged into a corner of the waterfront that seems, at least in part, forgotten by time, the place is a few blocks long and a few wide. Despite its handful of new developments, it still feels as secluded and unpretentious as in decades past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The longer you stay in Vinegar Hill, the harder it is not to know your neighbors,'' said Nicholas Evans-Cato, a longtime worker and renter in the area. ''If you see someone who hasn't moved their car for alternate-side-of-the-street parking, you generally know who it is and you ring their doorbell.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many locals are, in essence, living above the store. Mr. Evans-Cato, an artist, rents an apartment upstairs from his studio on Hudson Avenue, which he has operated since 1995, and a carpenter friend does the same. A friend who makes furniture lives a short walk from his own work space, as does Adam Meshberg, an architect and president of the local neighborhood association. People like to stick around, it seems, and others are noticing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Up to the mid-'90s,'' Mr. Meshberg said, ''rents were low, and it was very, very, very quiet. Now we're in 2010, and it's coming on the radar.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the most part, quiet still reigns along the cobblestone streets, save for trucks from the massive <span class="companylink">Con Edison</span> plant on the waterfront or from the Damascus Bakery, which episodically infuses the area with the singular aroma of baking pita. These are reminders that industry still has a presence, as it did back when the neighborhood was a bedroom community for workers at the Navy Yard next door and in Dumbo's factories and warehouses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of all the issues raised by the waterfront area's increasing popularity, it is the truck traffic that takes precedence -- especially its effects on the cobblestones, said Robert Perris, the district manager of the local Community Board 2. ''It shows how much people are invested in the architectural character of the neighborhood,'' he said, ''as well as how sort of sleepy it is.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last year or so, the Vinegar Hill House on Hudson Avenue, a restaurant that opened in late 2008, has focused a spotlight on the neighborhood. The last place to eat on the street was a diner that closed in the 1970s, Mr. Evans-Cato said. The restaurant's fare is creative and seasonal -- right now, braised wild boar shank and pumpkin ravioli are on offer -- and the owners, Sam Buffa and Jean Adamson, are both locals. In addition to approving critics, the place has garnered its share of regulars, happy for a nearby place to dine well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We figured that we would be busy enough, but we didn't expect this,'' said Mr. Buffa, who also lives above his business, having vacated a carriage house on the property to make room for storage and office space. ''We get people who drive from the Upper West Side. I can't tell you how many times people just had no clue this was here.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT YOU'LL FIND</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The neighborhood was named not for any unusual wellspring of vinegar but for a 1798 battle of the Irish Rebellion (one historical theory has it that the name was chosen to attract Irish immigrants). It takes up all of 9 or 10 blocks, and residents most likely number no more than a few hundred.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They have something of a love-hate relationship with their neighbors in Dumbo, appreciating the many services and stores now ensconced next door, but disturbed by increasing traffic, by the shadows of new condo towers and, it must be said, by unwelcome evidence that Dumboites are walking their dogs in Vinegar Hill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As Dumbo changes, we change,'' said Mr. Meshberg, the neighborhood association head. ''The more people moving into Dumbo, the more parking gets screwed up over here.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hudson Avenue is the area's focal point, even with just the one public establishment in the Vinegar Hill House. The road is lined with pre-Civil War row houses. Around the corner on Evans Street, visitors encounter an even older structure: the Commandant's Mansion, an 1806 estate overlooking the East River from behind an imposing gate. (It remains inhabited today, actually, though not by a commandant.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moving west from Hudson Avenue toward Dumbo, sturdy-looking old town houses, with fine examples on both Gold and Front Streets, are interspersed with the occasional warehouse or factory. Vinegar Hill's new market-rate condo developments include one at 100 Gold Street, next door to the Dorje Ling Buddhist Center, with its bright yellow facade. And on York Street, across from the towers of a public project called the Farragut Houses, further housing construction is in its early stages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vinegar Hill may soon have stores to call its own, as the city is seeking a developer for a retail complex in the Navy Yard. The businesses would take the place of Admiral's Row, a much-loved but decrepit group of row houses; many preservation groups have cried foul.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT YOU'LL PAY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers expecting Dumbo-like prices may be pleasantly surprised; values generally soften as one heads east from the Manhattan Bridge and south toward the Farragut Houses. A $445,000 studio in Vinegar Hill, for example, might go for $550,000 at the J Condominium a few blocks away in Dumbo, said M. Monica Novo, a senior vice president at Prudential Douglas Elliman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices have come down since 2006 and 2007, but percentages are hard to calculate because of the low inventory of properties. Town houses don't often come on the market, but when they do they are significantly more affordable than comparable properties in nearby Brooklyn Heights or Fort Greene. Often, they also need work; prices start at about $1.1 million but can reach $2 million for a house in pristine shape, according to Steven Gerber, a senior vice president at <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not going to be a Brooklyn Heights number'' in price, Mr. Gerber said, ''but if it does have a view and it's nicely done on the inside, that's not uncommon.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In terms of new and conversion properties that have sprung up, prices per square foot are staying in the $600 and $700 range, according to David Behin, a partner at the Developers Group. At 100 Gold Street, a 10-unit development, three units are now in contract, and prices for studios, one- and two-bedrooms range from $445,000 to $885,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Renters can opt for market-rate buildings like 99 Gold Street, where the Core Group Marketing is listing units from studios to two-bedrooms for $2,650 to $4,900 a month. Older units in town houses are seldom available. When they are, said Mr. Evans-Cato, a longtime renter, one-bedroom units start between $1,000 and $1,500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE SCHOOLS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vinegar Hill is home to one school, Public School 307 on York Street. In 2009, 61.2 percent of third, fourth and fifth graders met standards in English, 78.3 percent in mathematics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Junior high students can be zoned for the Dr. Susan S. McKinney Secondary School of the Arts, on Park Avenue in the upper part of Fort Greene near the Navy Yard. In 2009, 62.9 percent of students met standards in math, 54.4 percent in English.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One high school nearby is the Freedom Academy, on Nassau Street close to the Manhattan Bridge, where SAT averages last year were 413 in reading, 388 in math and 408 in writing, versus 480, 500 and 470 statewide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT TO DO</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outside of warm evenings at the Vinegar Hill House and community meetings of the neighborhood group, the neighborhood seems almost purposefully quiet. But busier areas aren't far away. Dumbo, Brooklyn Heights and Fort Greene all offer plenty of shopping and dining. The growing green spaces of Brooklyn Bridge Park are nearby, and a stroll across one of the bridges is always an option.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE COMMUTE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most residences in the neighborhood are no more than a 10-minute walk from the York Street subway station, the first stop into Brooklyn on the F line. The trip to Midtown takes 15 to 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE HISTORY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the original Dutch town of Breuckelen, Vinegar Hill was farmland until its purchase in 1784 by the Sands brothers, merchants and traders for whom a local street is named. They called the area Olympia, hoping to attract summer visitors from Manhattan; it was later known as part of Irishtown. The present name wasn't in the picture until the land was bought by John Jackson, a shipbuilder, who sold part of it to the federal government for use as a navy yard. Vinegar Hill soon grew into a small village of laborers and those who catered to them. (In 1822, nearly a quarter of all residents listed their occupations as tavern proprietors.)</p>

</div><div class="author">By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY </div><div>665 words</div><div>6 March 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>17</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The British possess many traits enviable to New Yorkers: the capacity to brew a better cup of tea, the decorum not to brag loudly about their bonuses in Midtown restaurants and a history rich with kings and queens who inspire novels and Hollywood movies. But they fall short in one area: brash self-promotion, especially when it comes to real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is partly why James Wynn, a former actor who became a video producer, has turned to one of Manhattan's largest real estate brokerage firms to sell what one British magazine identified as Britain's oldest home. Mr. Wynn asked the Prudential Douglas Elliman president, Dottie Herman, to sell his 12th-century property in Somerset, called Saltford Manor House, for 2.5 million pounds, or about $3.8 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wynn and his wife bought the ''uninhabitable shell'' in 1996 for 300,000 pounds. He called the renovation ''jolly hard work'' that involved tearing up floors and living in a temporary cottage with small children for more than a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2003, Country Life magazine named the five-bedroom, three-bath property England's oldest private home (royal palaces and castles were excluded from the survey) after it was able to date some original features to the first half of the 12th century. It has terra cotta frescoes in the bedrooms. The home once belonged to the Earl of Gloucester, who came from the same family as Gloucester in ''King Lear.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These details made Mr. Wynn fall in love with the property, and he published a book about its history, though he said that when he bought it he did not know he had bought England's oldest private home. He thought it was only ''800 years old.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wynn wants to sell his home because his work has been taking him to London more and his children are now teenagers. In 2008, he tried to sell the property through the brokerage firm Christie's and received interest from prospective buyers in Hong Kong and Saudi Arabia. But he had some concerns with the understated approach of the British to marketing his property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A brief survey of British property listings confirms Mr. Wynn's fears: while New York apartment listings for the gloomiest apartments are filled with phrases like ''breathtaking'' and ''magnificent'' and feature glamour shots, British estates are at most described as ''charming'' and feature mug-shot-style photographs some Manhattan brokers would consider real estate blasphemy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through the years, Mr. Wynn found that Americans who visited his home were more enthusiastic about its history than the British, who are ''quite casual about things that are old.'' So he contacted more than a half-dozen real estate brokers in New York and California before choosing Ms. Herman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I felt his passion,'' she said. ''I've learned to love that house without even seeing it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said she would not clutter the listing with phrases like ''Norman invasion gem.'' Her brokerage firm's Web listing says: ''On the ground floor, exquisite details abound: massive honeyed-oak beams, a Norman arch and Cotswold flagstone. Winding elm stairs lead to the first floor bedrooms, past a 16th-century window salvaged from an Elizabethan chapel, and up to the top floor and two additional bedrooms -- the largest of which blends New York loft with English Tudor.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Herman thinks an American would be a likely buyer because Americans appreciate older properties. But forget about price comparisons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When you're looking at a property that has 1,000 years of history, you can't comp it and see what's similar that sold in the area for the same price,'' she said. ''I don't remember anything this old that I've sold.''</p>

</div><div class="author">By DAVID BARBOZA </div><div>1192 words</div><div>5 March 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHANGHAI -- The spacious duplex comes with crocodile-skin bedposts, hand-carved bronze doors inlaid with Swarovski crystals -- and a $45 million price tag.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is still on the market, but Charles Tong, the developer of Tomson Riviera, a luxury riverfront complex in the heart of the financial district here, says he is having no trouble finding takers for similarly priced units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're selling three to four apartments every month,'' said Mr. Tong, seated in a white Versace easy chair. ''Now, people here want something more luxurious; they'd like a new lifestyle.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everyone agrees China is in the middle of a spectacular real estate boom. The question is whether it is in the middle of a rapidly growing real estate bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When other recent booms collapsed -- in the United States, for instance -- they depressed entire economies. In China's case, a bursting bubble could affect much of the world. China is the fastest-growing large economy and, so far, a main engine pulling the world out of recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beijing is clearly concerned. Authorities have recently moved to rein in the easy credit that has helped finance China's hyperdevelopment, including making it more difficult for home buyers to take out a second mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, a record $560 billion of residential property was sold in China, an increase of 80 percent from the year before, according to government statistics that are widely considered reliable. And with prices soaring, developers are scrambling to build more mansions, villas and high-rise apartments with names like Rich Gate, Park Avenue and Palais de Fortune.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signs of exuberance are everywhere. An investor in Shanghai recently bought 54 apartments in a single day; a villa sold for $30 million last year; and in December a consortium of developers paid more than $3.5 billion for a huge tract of land in Guangzhou, one of the highest prices paid for any property, anywhere. In the city of Tianjin, in north China, developers have created a $3 billion ''floating city,'' a series of islands built on a natural reservoir, featuring villas, shopping malls, a water amusement park and what they say will be the world's largest indoor ski resort.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is wild,'' said Andy Xie, a former <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> economist who is now an independent analyst. ''By all the traditional measures, like rental yield, this is a bubble.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speculators are snapping up properties on the expectation that prices will continue to rise, as prices have nearly every year for more than a decade. And powerful developers are working with local governments to transform old cities into urban dreamscapes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Shanghai, China's wealthiest and most dazzling city, is the epicenter of the boom. Prices here have risen more than 150 percent since 2003, pushing the price of a typical 1,100-square-foot apartment up to $200,000, according to real estate experts. (Shanghai residents typically earn less than $5,000 a year.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A buying frenzy has gripped the city, leading to billion-dollar land auctions and long waiting lists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The speed you buy a house here is faster than you buy vegetables,'' said Andy Xiang, an advertising executive who recently put down a large cash down payment to get the right to pay $1.3 million for an apartment in the city's exclusive Xintiandi area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few residences, though, are as upscale as Tomson Riviera, which consists of four golden-hued towers overlooking the Huangpu River, with a central garden mapped out in the shape of a dragon. The apartment complex's entrance has original artworks by Salvador Dali and well-known Chinese artists. The apartments, a few of which have been decorated by Armani and Fendi, as well as Versace, lease for $7,000 to $17,000 a month -- to high-level executives from companies like General Motors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who buy an apartment here tend to be extremely wealthy, like Liu Yiqian, an eccentric Shanghai entrepreneur whom Forbes magazine says is worth about $540 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Liu, 47, got his start driving a taxicab in Shanghai but eventually made a fortune investing in the stock market. In an interview this week, he acknowledged owning hundreds of apartments in Shanghai (he said he could not remember exactly how many), including a 6,000-square-foot apartment in Tomson Riviera, which he bought in 2008 for about $11.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I invest in properties,'' Mr. Liu said, noting that he also collects art, antiques and jade. ''I think in Shanghai in five to seven years the real estate prices will be even higher.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As they try to modulate the market, local and central governments here are walking a thin line. Land sales were a major source of government revenue, raising about $234 billion last year, an amount equal to over a third of the cost of China's half-trillion-dollar stimulus program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether the country is in the middle of a bubble has become the subject of a debate. Some economists, like Nicholas R. Lardy at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, say the housing boom is being propelled by a huge urbanization push that is creating premium-priced houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other analysts say prices are being propped up by greedy developers and government policies that are making housing increasingly unaffordable for the masses migrating to big cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the fear of a bubble here, Mr. Tong said his prices were just right, particularly because of so much hidden wealth in China. The publicly listed company is controlled by his family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have a friend,'' he said. ''She makes maternity clothes. Her company has 20 percent of the world's market share, and they're not even a listed company.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Tomson's prices are soaring. The most recent apartment sold for about $2,300 a square foot. The average luxury apartment in Manhattan sold for just under $1,900 a square foot in the fourth quarter of 2009, according to Prudential Douglas Elliman real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, for the price of a Tomson apartment in Shanghai, a buyer could easily purchase a 6,000-square-foot home in Los Angeles built by Frank Lloyd Wright and now for sale ($10.5 million), or a 52-acre site with a 22-room residence in New Canaan, Conn. ($24 million).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a sales agent at Tomson Riviera says this is the future financial capital of the world, not the dying one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Look at this bronze door,'' said Wang Yaodong. ''That costs $50,000! Look at these Gaggenau appliances. They were made in Germany.'' The glasses were imported from Belgium, the Jacuzzi from Italy. And don't worry about losing your key, he said, ''This lock can read the palm of your hand.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Slowly, signs of confidence are returning to the region's housing market. The latest Case-Shiller index data shows that Bay Area home prices in December were up 4.8 percent from 12 months earlier. Real estate agents report seeing multiple offers again, including on foreclosed properties, which made up 36.6 percent of all homes sold in the area in January, according to MDA <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Redfin, the real estate company, reported that there was competition for 92 percent of the offers it presented last month on Bay Area listings priced under $500,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are at least three significant bumps on the road to recovery. And they could be coming to a neighborhood near you. TRACEY TAYLOR</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HIGH-END STRESS Distress has migrated up the price ladder, and while most foreclosed properties are still found in lower-cost inland suburbs and urban areas -- like Solano, Sonoma and Napa -- there are signs that defaults are spilling into wealthier neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Linnette Edwards, a Realtor at <span class="companylink">Prudential California Realty</span> in the East Bay, said she was starting to see short sales on $1 million-plus homes in Lafayette, Orinda, Walnut Creek, Danville and the Oakland hills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Job losses and downsizing, the increasing difficulty of securing refinancing and the resetting of nontraditional mortgages are leaving many homeowners in the higher-price brackets overextended..</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AN HONEST ASSESSMENT Regulations intended to tighten the appraisal industry are having unintended consequences, not always beneficial. The new rules call for clear water between the lender and the carrying out of an appraisal. Appraisal management companies have stepped into the breach, and they often hire out-of-area appraisers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Complaints from homeowners about what they see as faulty appraisals are on the rise and deals can fall apart late in the process. Nancy Townsend, a member of the Northern California Chapter of the Appraisal Institute, advised homeowners to pre-empt problems by being more proactive, like insisting on a local appraiser, and said agents must take more responsibility for transactions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOLDING BACK The elephant in the room is actually the shadow on the horizon, specifically shadow inventory. ''Shadow inventory'' is the term used for repossessed homes that lenders are holding back from the market. If that inventory is unloaded en masse at fire-sale prices, it can drive down home values in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span> estimates it could take up to three years to clear this type of housing stock at a national level. A Feb. 16 report stated, ''Recent positive housing reports should not be construed as a sign that the distress in the residential housing market is abating, but rather should be attributed to the temporarily limited supply of homes on the market.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a local level, the hot spots will be those that already have high percentages of foreclosures. Alameda, Contra Costa and Santa Clara Counties top the Bay Area charts with notices of default in the last quarter of 2009: 2,806, 3,501 and 2,816, respectively. The cities of Pittsburg, Brentwood, Antioch, Vallejo and Fairfield have been particularly hard hit.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Constructing or renovating a building to make it environmentally sustainable can be a daunting task for any owner, but Jamestown Properties, a German commercial real estate investment company, has decided it will go ''green'' in nearly its entire $4 billion portfolio of buildings, all located in the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The overhaul involves fixes as simple as installing low-flow water fixtures and as complex as revamping heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems. Jamestown expects to recoup costs through energy savings, the ability to charge higher rents and higher resale values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jamestown, an acquisition and management firm based in Cologne, Germany, and Atlanta, has invested $12 billion in commercial properties in the United States since 1983 through private equity funds for German investors. Matt M. Bronfman, the company's managing director and chief operations officer, said Jamestown's executives believed that real estate holdings, new and existing, would be increasingly valued by their sustainability and environmental impact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We come at things from a bit of a European perspective, and Europe is far ahead of the United States in the environmental movement,'' Mr. Bronfman said. Sustainability ''will become a key factor to the point where, if you haven't taken environmental measures, you will have trouble, whether it's leasing your office building or what have you,'' he added. The company said it would spend $3 million to $10 million to retrofit all of its properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jamestown invests through private equity funds. There may be several dozen public and private green building funds worldwide, said Gary Pivo, director of the Responsible Property Investing Center at the University of Arizona and a professor of urban planning and natural resources. Prominent ones include the Investa Commercial Property Fund, based in Australia, and the Rose Smart Growth Investment Fund I, based in New York. ''There are an increasing number of private funds that are incorporating green buildings and energy-efficient buildings and other principles of sustainability into their property selections and their portfolios,'' Mr. Pivo said. ''But there are not very many that are committed exclusively to green buildings.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December 2008, Jamestown acquired Green Street Properties, a development and consulting firm in Atlanta that focused on environmental sustainability. It will continue to operate as a subsidiary of Jamestown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jamestown ''saw us as a way of accelerating the greening of their brand and portfolio,'' said Katharine Kelley, who retained her position as president and chief executive of Green Street. ''One of the first things we did after joining forces was to start work immediately on a number of existing buildings in Jamestown's portfolio.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One building where the conversion is virtually complete is 999 Peachtree Street, a 621,000-square-foot office building with street-level retail space in midtown Atlanta, acquired through the Jamestown Co-Invest IV fund in 2007 for $127 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jamestown has obtained gold certification from the United States Green Building Council with various strategies, like starting bicycle sharing and carpooling programs, and adding a <span class="companylink">Zipcar</span> station. Energy-efficient lighting saves 476,000 kilowatt hours a year, and the building recycles paper and uses sustainable Post-it notes and file folders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tenants in the building, including ERS Global and Flad Architects, follow sustainable practices, said Michael Phillips, Jamestown's creative director. ''I would say we look kindly on tenant build-outs or interior choices that are green,'' Mr. Phillips said. ''But I don't think it's a requirement.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The goal with 999 Peachtree is to hold it for the duration of the closed-end Co-Invest IV fund, which is seven to 10 years, benefiting from reduced operating costs that may also attract tenants who will pay a bit more, Mr. Phillips said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rents for green offices have been shown to be about 2 percent higher than rents for comparable buildings nearby, according to a study done by John M. Quigley, an economist and professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, and two other researchers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the fund closes, Jamestown will sell 999 Peachtree, but it is difficult to tell how much the building's conversion and certification will add to its valuation, Mr. Phillips said. Since green building funds have been around only for a half-dozen years or so, few if any of their assets have sold, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It depends on who buys the investment at the end,'' Mr. Phillips said. ''An insurance company or pension fund typically wants to buy buildings that offer the most modern technology. Green technology is considered the most progressive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''At the moment,'' he continued, ''the advantages of being green might be less about a premium, and more about offering a wider pool of buyers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other buildings that Jamestown is retrofitting for environmental sustainability include 1250 Broadway, near 31st Street, and Chelsea Market, at 75 Ninth Avenue between 15th and 16th Streets in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While 1250 Broadway is poised to obtain a gold certification from the Green Building Council, Chelsea Market, a collection of 17 buildings cobbled together, is quite old and doesn't make a good candidate for certification, Ms. Kelley said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You have to customize a green solution depending on the specific project, and its investment profile, and where it is in the market cycle,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jamestown has performed an energy audit at 1250 Broadway, a 770,000-square-foot office building built in 1968, that has led to a 15 percent reduction in annual energy consumption and carbon emissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's things as mundane as adjusting fan speeds or repairing or upgrading controls, or even some more expensive items like cleaning the chiller cores,'' Ms. Kelley said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jamestown is also setting up programs to replace cleaning chemicals with environmentally safe products and retrain the custodial staff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're putting aerators on the faucets, and changing out the water closets in the bathrooms and looking at perimeter office lighting,'' Ms. Kelley said. ''There's a whole laundry list of topics.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within a year, Jamestown will recoup the $350,000 it has invested in converting the 39-story building through increased efficiencies, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plans for Chelsea Market, a 1.1 million-square-foot retail and office property, call for a rooftop market garden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pivo said there had been no empirical studies showing the effectiveness of green building funds, which are still only a fraction of the entire universe of property funds, in achieving environmental ends, though he said they should prove beneficial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is at least a theoretical probability that when enough investors commit to selecting for greener or more sustainable investments,'' he said, ''that that will lower the cost of capital for corporations and developers who are working in the greener and more sustainable area.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jon Boggiano, a principal partner in Everblue Energy, a company in Charlotte, N.C., that offers training in sustainable building principles, said green building funds could overcome one of the biggest problems in sustainable building -- a lack of capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the truly sustainable buildings, he said, cost more upfront and are developed by government, universities or as corporate headquarters. ''Those owners are looking at the lifetime costs of the facility, whereas most commercial developers look at the first cost and don't really care about future utility payments or impacts because they will sell the building and not have to pay those bills.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Unless the capital that's buying buildings is willing to pay for true sustainability,'' Mr. Boggiano said, ''developers are going to go for cheaper costs. So if a fund is willing to say that green is going to be one of our criteria, and they're willing to invest in those front costs, that actually is the best way to have an impact.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN the nine years since he came to New York with $500 in his pocket, Martin-Christopher Harper estimates that he has moved at least 40 times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he lists the neighborhoods he has lived in -- in chronological order -- he sounds like a bartender reciting a long list of microbrews: ''Brooklyn, Chelsea Hotel for a moment, Bronx, Carroll Gardens, Crown Heights, Red Hook, Carroll Gardens, Greenpoint, Chelsea, Crown Heights, Carroll Gardens, Williamsburg, Bushwick, Bed-Stuy, Williamsburg, East Williamsburg ...''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Harper, 32, a hairstylist, moved to New York from Los Angeles, where he still has a share in an apartment. He says he moves a lot because he is always looking for a better deal, a better space, a better neighborhood. He acknowledges, though, that moving is something of a compulsion, and that after tackling the issue in therapy and connecting his feverish relocating to his moving frequently as a child, he has begun to cut down. He has lasted more than a year in his current apartment in East Williamsburg, a record for him in New York. These days he has a roommate, Eli J. Schmidt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether one moves frequently or almost never, moving is an intensely emotional experience. The underlying psychological issues involved in real estate decisions are of great interest to therapists and psychologists, because housing and moving are filled with symbolism, the hope for new beginnings, crushing disappointments, loss, anxiety and fear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Panic can really set in around your home and your apartment,'' said Ronnie Greenberg, a Manhattan psychoanalyst. ''It's a matrix of safety, so moving is incredibly stressful and people don't realize it -- they mainly talk about the packing and the external part of moving.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Harper and others who choose to move frequently are likely to be risk takers, psychologists say. If they moved a lot as children, they may be experiencing what Freudian analysts call ''repetition compulsion,'' or a Goldilocks complex, always looking for the just the right place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some therapists, borrowing a term used in Alcoholics Anonymous, call frequent moving ''pulling a geographic,'' seeking external changes to change internal problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as Elizabeth Stirling, a psychologist in Santa Fe, N.M., who specializes in helping people make life changes, said, ''No matter how much you move, you still take yourself with you.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, those who never or rarely move can be frozen by a fear of change, psychologists say. The prospect of leaving the place that is the center of your universe or the one constant in your life can be frightening. Even finding a new dry cleaner, deli or coin laundry can stir up deep worries of impending isolation and loneliness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the height of the real estate market, those who experienced moving as a source of high anxiety were compensated by the seduction of profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For the longest time, moving was a bitter consequence of making money when you were selling real estate,'' said Michael Moshan, a real estate lawyer and a partner in Gold Scollar Moshan in SoHo. ''If I was selling my apartment and buying another one, I was making money. I had to swallow the pain of moving because I was banking something significant. Now people are moving and the moving aspect becomes much more bitter.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Packing and sorting through a life's worth of belongings -- especially, say, if the move is the unhappy result of a divorce or other trauma -- can be gut-wrenching.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in the current climate, especially in New York City, moving is filled with more angst than usual because people feel at the mercy of market conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Potential buyers are being rejected by banks on the eve of closing, which leaves both buyers and sellers in limbo. Would-be buyers or those wanting to rent a better apartment have canceled their plans because of lost jobs or because their retirement funds and other investments were worth less. Many people feel stuck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doug LeBow, whose co-op board has rejected three buyers for his one-bedroom on 11th Street and Broadway, said he felt ''imprisoned.'' His apartment has been on the market off and on for three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. LeBow, 40, said he received an offer of $1.12 million in cash on his 1,100-square-foot apartment in 2007; he had paid $545,000 for it shortly before the real estate boom. In 2005, after he lost his job as a creative director for the in-house advertising agency of World Wrestling Entertainment, he assumed that his real estate investment would allow him to start over. He planned to expand his production company and become a partner in a restaurant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while the sale was in contract, the co-op board turned down the buyer, he said. The next offer, $950,000, did not come until a year later; that buyer, too, was turned down. So was the latest, who offered $825,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York City, co-op boards have wide legal latitude for rejecting buyers. The president of Mr. LeBow's co-op board did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. LeBow said battling the board depressed and frustrated him. While he feels fortunate that he is still able to afford his monthly mortgage and maintenance, a combined total of $4,000, he said he was quickly running through his savings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Living in the apartment, and doing some freelance work at home, makes him wonder if he is somehow doomed to stay there, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was lucky enough, I haven't had to sell pencils on a street corner,'' Mr. LeBow said. ''And it's not so much the money; it's the helplessness. I have felt very much imprisoned and hamstrung. There's nothing worse than having no control of your own situation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added: ''I have been ready to move for three years, and I literally have not been allowed to move.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He recently put the apartment back on the market, asking $850,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Stephen Klein, 43, a renter, a single father and a librarian at the City University of New York, the process of moving is ''very emotional.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Klein has moved nine times in the last 14 years, often as relationships -- including a marriage -- began and ended. Now, he would very much like to move from his rental in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, because he needs more space. He wishes his 10-year-old daughter had her own room instead of the loft he built for her above the kitchen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he would like to stay in Prospect Heights, where he has friends and a sense of community -- all the more important because he is single. But the apartments with more space that he can afford are in far-off neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I feel like I'm a refugee,'' he said. ''I really feel like I wish I could have a sense of home. I feel like I'm floating out there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Therapists say that they often hear upsetting language from their clients when they talk about real estate, words like trapped, stuck, imprisoned and -- Mr. Klein's description of himself -- ''refugee.'' And they try to help them reframe the issue in a more positive light.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you say you are trapped,'' said Linda Sapadin, a Long Island psychologist and a motivational speaker, ''that's like the trapping of an animal. It's a pretty shocking visualization. It's better to say, 'I can't move right now,' and ask what can you do to make your environment safer, more pleasant. Adding the two words 'right now' is a tremendous liberator psychologically.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Will Cox's apartment on Riverside Drive and 92nd Street has been a constant in his life -- too constant. He has ''walked down the same block 10,000 times,'' and longed to leave the neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cox, 38 and the owner of a television and film post-production company, has lived in a rent-controlled apartment that he took over from his parents, who now live in Connecticut. He has never lived anywhere else, except for the four years he was away at college in California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The place has allowed him and his wife, Lynn Van Lith, who have two daughters, ages 1 and 3, a bit of a financial cushion. But in some ways it has also been a burden: Giving up a $1,200 two-bedroom apartment in Manhattan is not an easy decision, even if you are eager to go.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The logjam broke when Mr. Cox was offered an incentive by his landlord. He is moving today to an apartment he and Ms. Van Lith bought in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. And beneath the financial calculations of the move, and the uneasiness that comes with putting all of their savings into the apartment, they have complex feelings. One is excitement: They are off to start ''a new history,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's an opportunity to purge and create a whole new life that's now going to be my wife's and my life together,'' Mr. Cox said. ''I'm finding pots and pans that haven't been used since my father fried eggs in them 25 years ago.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, leaving the apartment, cracked bathroom-floor tiles and all, represents that classic and difficult task of adulthood, leaving home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have all these memories of the neighborhood, these sorts of ghosts that follow you around,'' he said. ''And for me, it doesn't at the moment feel entirely like my own life. I still feel like I'm under the shadow of my parents. That rite of passage of finding your own place to live in New York, that experience, I had never had it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Harper, the serial mover, has had that experience so many times that he practically has his moving man, Mark Ehrhardt, on speed dial. He talks about Mr. Ehrhardt, the president of Movers, Not Shakers! of Brooklyn, the way some people talk about a nanny, a cleaning lady or a shrink.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Mark's been with me now for six years,'' he said. ''He's a part of my world, he's seen me grow.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Harper said that he had cut back on chasing novel spaces, finding the ''newness'' he had been seeking in his work rather than apartment hunting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, he admitted to checking <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span> for rentals a few times a week. Then he confessed to almost daily perusing, adding sheepishly, ''I always think about moving.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EARLY this month, three generations of the Delfino family moved into the 3,400-square-foot stone and stucco home they designed for themselves in Port Jefferson Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike Delfino Jr., 52, and his wife, Maria, 49, took the master suite on the right side of the first floor. Their sons, ages 16 and 20, have bedrooms upstairs and a large game room that could be a living room if they decided to boomerang back home as adults.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If they get married,'' their father said, ''there is room for them to have their wives there and get a start.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the left side of the first floor is another master suite, with sitting room and bath, for Mrs. Delfino's mother, Anne Calaci, 84, who is making the transition to the Delfinos' new spread from her home in Mineola.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Mrs. Calaci's husband died four years ago, the Delfinos wanted her to move into the 2,200-square-foot center-hall colonial they then owned, also in Port Jefferson Station. She balked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The other home was so small she thought she was going to be in our way,'' said Mr. Delfino, the owner of an insulation company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response, the family decided to design a place that would accommodate their multigenerational needs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When we married and had the little ones,'' Mr. Delfino said, Mr. and Mrs. Calaci ''were there for us every step of the way. It's time to pay back.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the Island, builders are emphasizing versatility in their designs, putting up homes easily adaptable for multiple generations seeking to live under one roof. Lennard Axinn, the Delfinos' builder and the owner of Island Estates Homes in Ronkonkoma, said he had found strong customer interest in houses ''customizable for a wide variety of needs.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''On the practical side,'' Mr. Axinn added, ''the sandwich generation has kids to raise and parents to be the guardian of.'' In a home he recently finished in a new subdivision, the grandfather has living quarters in the basement with a separate entrance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's the only market with a pulse,'' Mr. Axinn said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That may be because buying a house conceived with multiple generations in mind makes a lot more sense to a forward-thinking buyer than trying to retrofit a smaller, more conventional house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of households nationwide with more than two generations expanded to 6.2 million in 2008, from 5 million in 2000, according to AARP.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephen Melman, the director of economic services at the National Association of Home Builders, a trade group in Washington, said that at its International Builders' Show in Las Vegas in January, the model ''new American home'' included, on opposite ends of the house, a master bedroom for the owners and a second master bedroom for their parents. The design allowed room for privacy and ''acoustical separation,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second master, also known as the in-law suite, ''doesn't have to be enormous in terms of floor area,'' Mr. Melman said, ''but it must be complete, with closet space and a full bathroom.'' When smartly designed, it would include accessible ''universal design elements'' like nonslip floors, a step-free shower entrance and doorways that could accommodate a wheelchair, so that an aging owner wouldn't have to look elsewhere for user-friendly housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The same quarters might also be used by adult children returning from college who ''might make too much noise or need privacy,'' Mr. Melman added, or for a caregiver for the owner. Flexibility is important. If the caregiver moved out, the room could become an office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Douglas Schmieder, a builder in Southampton whose cedar-sided postmodern homes average $1 million, said that four of the eight houses he had built for clients in the last two to three years had included ''separate living quarters'' with kitchens, in anticipation of elderly parents or a college student returning home after graduation. ''Generally it is on the ground level with a separate access'' and an open layout, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steven Kosoff, a builder in Matinecock, recently completed a 7,000-square-foot turreted house in Upper Brookville, which he has listed at $2.95 million. The floor-to-ceiling limestone fireplace in the great room, the lavish oversized kitchen and the elevator shaft are not its only draws. Double doors off the foyer lead to a 26-by-16-foot in-law suite with a full bath, including whirlpool tub and separate shower, while the main master bedroom is one of five upstairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kosoff described the shingle and brick home, set on two acres, as easily customizable. The ground-floor suite could be divided if an owner wanted a sitting room or it could be configured as a library.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joseph Fusaro, the owner of AMJ Building in Huntington, was inspired by the work he did converting part of his own home for his mother-in-law to build a 3,500-square-foot Victorian-style home on Cuba Hill Road with multigenerational options already built in. The rear wing on the first floor is geared to returning adult children or elderly parents -- with a separate entrance, its own bath and easy access to the kitchen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We wanted to be versatile,'' Mr. Fusaro said. ''Multigenerational is something people are looking for.'' Others could use the space as a playroom or office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even when the need is not imminent, Mr. Schmieder said, his homes have preinstalled rough plumbing and electrical lines, in case homeowners want to finish accessory living quarters later on. He generally designs with expansion plans for 1,000 to 1,500 extra feet. ''When people build,'' he said, ''they want to accommodate for that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christopher Burnside, a broker and senior director of the Bridgehampton office of Brown Harris Stevens, and a builder on the East End, said a significant number of home shoppers were asking for ''first-floor master bedrooms for their parents.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Accordingly, in designing the 6,000-square-foot modern farmhouse he is building overlooking polo fields in Bridgehampton, he has included a master suite on the first floor and a second one upstairs. Four bedrooms will be on the other side of the house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Builders are giving people what they want,'' Mr. Burnside said. ''No one wants to put their mother in the basement.''</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Mark P. Boisi</span>
</div><div class="author">By VIVIAN MARINO </div><div>777 words</div><div>28 February 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>10</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of March 1, Mr. Boisi, 56, will become the chairman for the New York region of Cassidy Turley, a new commercial real estate company made up of eight firms, including four former Colliers affiliates that merged into a holding company over a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before joining Cassidy Turley, Mr. Boisi was the chairman of Colliers ABR.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Tell me about Cassidy Turley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A It's a new full-service, privately held commercial real estate enterprise. It is, right out of the box, the fourth-largest in the United States. Behind <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>, <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> and Cushman &amp;Wakefield.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q How so?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Our revenues, on a combined basis, are in excess of $400 million, and we believe that places us at fourth. But if you use square footage under management, we're No. 3. Presently, we manage 420 million square feet of property across the U.S. If you use the number of brokers in the organization -- we have over 900 -- we think we're No. 3 or No. 4.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q What's the genesis of the Cassidy Turley name?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A They are actually two legacy names from former Colliers firms. One was Cassidy Pinkard, and Cassidy is no longer active in the business. Turley is from Colliers Turley Martin Tucker in the Midwest, and Mr. Turley is no longer active. We wanted to have two inactive legacy names provide the name for the new firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q That also thwarts potential squabbling among partners, no?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A There would have been several names on the shingle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q So why the split with Colliers?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A We wanted to create our own company, our own brand, our own vision, and we wanted to move away from a network structure. A network structure is a collection of independently owned companies that sort of brand together -- they don't own the brand. We are one company, one set of shareholders. We own it, we control it. And unlike a network structure where they basically license the name, we own our name.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q How will you compete with Colliers?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A I think Cassidy Turley formerly was probably the largest and most productive of the Colliers entities in the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We have gone through an extensive program with branding experts to create the brand and the logo and the promotional campaign, and frankly we're spending a fair amount of resources in public relations and advertising over the next 10 to 12 months. We're very optimistic that our clients, new and old, will catch on to the name quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York, almost every single client is following us. We've been sending out e-mail blasts to our clients just to make sure that they're prepared for March 1. One of the largest property owners in New York comments, ''It's the same people, the same level of service?'' And I said yes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Who are your biggest clients?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Some of our biggest clients are AEW Capital, the M.T.A., United Federation of Teachers, <span class="companylink">LVMH</span>, Random House -- I mean the list goes on and on, and <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span>. They're tenants or they're owners of property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q How does the New York market factor into the company's plans?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A We're one of the smallest divisions -- we have approximately 45 brokers and in terms of property management, we have approximately 14 million square feet, pretty much trophy property. We have 277 Park Avenue, we have 250 Park Avenue. The focus is to grow the New York market threefold if we can.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q What are the occupancy rates for the New York buildings that you manage, and how are you attracting tenants there?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Our occupancy rate for the entire portfolio is about 95 percent; we're probably only a couple of percentage points off the peak. Most landlords offer concession packages that involve a fair amount of free rent, sometimes in excess of a year. And they're offering to pay full commissions to the brokerage community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Will you expand globally?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A We'll have the ability to service our clients internationally through our partnership with <span class="companylink">GVA Grimley</span> of Britain. We've signed a memorandum of understanding and hope to formalize it probably in a month or two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q I'm also interviewing Mark Jaccom, the new head of Colliers International's tristate hub. Anything you'd like to say to him?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Best of luck. I think he's going to have a noble competitor.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">January Existing Home Sales Drop Despite Tax Credit</span>
</div><div class="author">By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ </div><div>877 words</div><div>27 February 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales fell in January, a real estate trade group reported on Friday, suggesting that a government tax credit meant to help prop up the market is having limited success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes fell 7.2 percent in January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.05 million, according to the report, which was released by the National Association of Realtors. That followed a similarly dreary report on Wednesday that showed the lowest level of new home sales since 1963.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taken together, the reports suggested the allure of the government's credit of up to $8,000 was waning after helping send sales up sharply in the fall. As a result, economists are rethinking the power of the tax credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You have really low interest rates, prices have dropped to the point where there are a lot of good deals out there, but you're not seeing any pickup in sales,'' said Patrick Newport, an economist for IHS Global Insight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many analysts believe the surge is still to come. Americans have been known to procrastinate when it comes to finances, and some economists expect a last-minute rush as the April 30 deadline for the credit nears. A similar phenomenon played out in November when the tax credit was about to expire; Congress then voted to extend it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, there is a sense that demand for homes has weakened, given that the most eager home buyers probably completed deals in the fall. In addition, mounting debt burdens, coupled with scarcer paychecks, continue to constrain Americans' willingness to spend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The larger question, economists say, is whether the housing market will be able to thrive -- or even hold steady -- in a post-stimulus world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is clearly on life support,'' said Nicolas P. Retsinas, director of the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University. ''What's going to happen when the government is not there? How real is the nascent recovery? How sustainable is this?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists attributed the recent declines in home sales to high unemployment and swelling household debt. Some also pointed to unusually cold weather in December and a series of snowstorms in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who are more optimistic about the rebound for housing note that sales remain 11.5 percent higher from the levels of January 2009 and that inventories continue to decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But applications for mortgages have tumbled, dropping to the lowest level in 13 years last week. And home prices in major cities increased only slightly in December, according to one barometer, while a broader index showed prices actually falling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists expect sales to decline modestly in the summer in the absence of the tax credit, before picking up again toward the end of the year if unemployment eases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just how significantly the jobs market will improve this year, however, remains unclear. The economy is still shedding jobs, and the unemployment rate reached 9.7 percent in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists remain wary about the prospects for growth as government stimulus fades. A separate report on Friday showed that the economy expanded at the end of 2009 at a more vigorous pace than previously thought. Gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 5.9 percent -- the fastest pace in more than six years -- compared with an original forecast of 5.7 percent, the Commerce Department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer spending, a critical driver of growth that typically helps lead recoveries, continues to be tepid, dimming hopes for a fast-paced recovery. The government originally said spending rose 2 percent in the fourth quarter, but it revised that number to 1.7 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fourth quarter's energetic pace was primarily the result of businesses easing the reduction in stockpiles. Inventories fell by $16.9 billion in the quarter, compared with the $33.5 billion drop originally reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy also got a lift from more robust business spending, which climbed 6.5 percent, compared with an original forecast of 2.9 percent. Even as they remained hesitant to hire, employers took small steps toward expanding, buying items like software and equipment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Growth was held back by a greater-than-expected swelling of the trade deficit, as manufacturers and other relied on imported goods to rebuild their businesses. The deficit widened to $40.2 billion in December -- its highest level in a year -- a 10.4 percent increase from November. Helped by a weak dollar, exports have grown rapidly in recent months, but not fast enough to overtake the pace of imports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists expect growth to be muted in the coming quarters -- moving forward at about 2 or 3 percent -- as businesses reduce their inventories at a quicker pace and stimulus programs disappear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There was nothing here to change anyone's mind about the future,'' wrote Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist for MFR, a consulting firm. ''The most important factors limiting growth will be a less supportive policy stance and households continuing to struggle with ravaged balance sheets and lingering labor market weakness.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home builder <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> posted a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss on Wednesday as it took fewer write-downs and pointed to an improved housing market. But a bleak report from the Commerce Department on new home sales drove the sector's shares lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its statement, <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> said it believed that the choppy housing market was gradually calming. For the first quarter ended on Jan. 31, Toll said its loss had narrowed to $40.8 million, or 25 cents a share, from $88.9 million, or 55 cents a share, a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts on average were expecting a loss of 35 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the second half of 2009, home builders have had increased orders as federal home-buying tax credits have pushed buyers into the market. At Toll, orders rose 98 percent to 526 homes and traffic increased in the last month and even more in the last week, when its winter promotion started.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a widespread lack of mortgage financing is making it hard for Toll to convert its orders into sales because even eager home buyers are still having trouble either selling their own homes or obtaining mortgages, said Merrill H. Ross, an analyst at BGB Securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results were continued sales declines both nationally and at individual builders like Toll, where revenue fell 20 percent to $326.7 million in the first quarter, down from $409 million in the quarter a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is still not a lot of visibility as to when they will book the revenue in the contracts they've received,'' said Mr. Ross, who had thought Toll might make a profit in the second half of the year but lowered his estimates to reflect a loss in each quarter and a loss of $1.25 for the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first-quarter loss included write-downs of $33.4 million, sharply lower than last year's $156.6 million.</p>

</div><div class="author">By CHARLES V. BAGLI </div><div>1007 words</div><div>25 February 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>25</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A hedge fund that has acquired a significant portion of the debt on the troubled Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village complexes in Manhattan moved in court this week to take control of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move is expected to complicate the already byzantine political and financial situation surrounding the largest apartment complexes in Manhattan, and to send tremors though 25,000 tenants worried about the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village were bought by a partnership of Tishman Speyer Properties and BlackRock Realty in 2006 for a record $5.4 billion. But the owners defaulted on their $3 billion mortgage in January and have since agreed to turn the properties, long an affordable oasis for working- and middle-class tenants, over to lenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One debt holder, <span class="companylink">Appaloosa Management</span>, a fund led by David Tepper that is based in New Jersey, filed papers in United States District Court in Manhattan on Tuesday challenging the company currently overseeing the two sprawling complexes on behalf of lenders, saying that the company had acted ''irrationally and imprudently'' in pursuing a course that could cost debt holders hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its motion to intervene, Appaloosa objected to a decision by the company, CW Capital Management, to foreclose on the owners of Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village. Arguing that a foreclosure could cost as much as $200 million in transfer taxes, Appaloosa said that CW Capital should have pushed the owners to go into bankruptcy court, thereby avoiding those taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tepper said that he did not want to take over the complexes so much as he wanted to stop CW Capital from acting in a ''reckless'' manner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was unclear, Appaloosa said, whether debt holders would be liable for more than $200 million in rent rebates. Last year, New York's highest court ruled that the owners had improperly converted 4,400 apartments to market rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sale of Stuyvesant Town, as well as hundreds of other ''meat-and-potato'' apartment buildings in the city, set off a hue and cry during the residential housing boom from tenants and elected officials about the loss of affordable housing. That loss has become even more palpable as many of these highly leveraged deals unraveled when property values plummeted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The fact that these investors so grossly overleveraged these buildings is a symptom of the larger economic crisis that we're all dealing with now,'' said Benjamin Dulchin, executive director of the Association for Neighborhood and Housing Development. ''The fact that some of these players are trying to further maximize their profit, again at the expense of affordable housing in the city, is pretty horrifying.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although rents at Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village only covered about two-thirds of the debt service on the $3 billion mortgage, Tishman Speyer and BlackRock had planned on increasing profits by converting rent stabilized apartments to market rates. But their plan failed, and the property is now worth an estimated $1.8 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The tenants are not in favor of prolonged legal wrangling,'' said Daniel R. Garodnick, a city councilman who has lived in the complexes all his life. ''We don't think it will be helpful to extend the process here by fighting among the creditor parties.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Appaloosa, which has asked the court to allow it to intervene in the matter, also claims that CW Capital has ''irreconcilable conflicts of interest'' because it is both the ''servicer'' for the mortgage and a key debt holder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $3 billion Stuyvesant Town mortgage was combined with mortgages from other properties and sold to many investors as a commercial mortgage-backed security. But some debt holders have a higher standing for getting paid than others, which can become a major point of contention if the property is worth less than the mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tepper, whose company has acquired control of more than $750 million of $3 billion in mortgages held by five separate trusts, said in an interview Wednesday that he wanted CW Capital to fulfill its fiduciary interest to debt holders to maximize recovery of the mortgage. He said his company was surprised by CW Capital's sudden decision to foreclose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We actually want them to do what they're supposed to do,'' Mr. Tepper said of CW Capital. ''We're trying to uphold our rights.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Appaloosa made a profit of about $7 billion last year, including $2.5 billion for Mr. Tepper. His firm has been recently focused on buying debt at a steep discount that is backed by loans on properties like Stuyvesant Town, although he said he had first acquired some of the Stuyvesant Town debt in 2008. The more money that debt holders get for the property in a resale, the bigger his profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tepper said his interests were not ''at odds'' with those of tenants. ''We recognize the fact that at some point, there needs to be some degree of rent controlled apartments there,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the most recent appraisal put the value of the complexes at about $1.8 billion, many analysts and investors say that over time the complexes, which contain more than 11,000 apartments, will be worth far more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senator Charles E. Schumer, who has been active on behalf of the tenants, said Wednesday: ''We must avoid going back to the future and having any new buyer overpay for the complex that leaves tenants with an uncertain future, and we can't have that. The bottom line is we must protect current and future tenants and preserve Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village as havens for the middle class.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village Tenants Association is pursuing a plan that would allow some tenants to buy their apartments, while ensuring that thousands of other units stay affordable under the state's rent rules.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LAS VEGAS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A HOUSE with 32 chandeliers, twin spiral staircases and so much rococo plasterwork that Marie Antoinette, were she planning a weekend in Vegas, would say, ''The heck with the Bellagio, I want to stay with the Hart family in that rundown neighborhood where Liberace used to live,'' may not be for you.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's understandable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thirteen bathrooms are a lot to clean, and the Elvis Room, where a life-size cardboard Elvis, with courtly country-boy manners and a velvet voice, murmurs, ''Thankya verra much, thanks for lettin' me talk to you,'' is startling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big houses have their problems, and this one -- built by Toni Hart, a former evangelical preacher and gospel singer, and scrolled and extolled, ornamented and cemented by her son Larry Hart with his cake-decorating kit -- is no exception. Although the home, which the family calls Hartland Mansion, does provide an exceptional backdrop when Ms. Hart, an ordained minister, performs weddings there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Welcome to my shiny world,'' Larry Hart said when he opened the door, and he was not kidding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The entrance hall has a dramatic black-and-white checkerboard floor and a 35-foot dome. Stair rails are swagged with stiffly wired gold lame, white silk roses and ivory velvet. The living room measures 33 by 57 feet -- so big, they were able to shoot a scene for the film ''Casino'' there. Ms. Hart's bedroom has a velvet bedspread, made by her son Larry, which is ornamented with cabochon pearls and weighs 34 pounds. The house itself takes up some 25,500 square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hart, a singer and composer whose gospel musical, ''Sisterella,'' counted Michael Jackson among its producers, created all eight bedrooms: the four-poster swags made of bed sheets; the ruched silk ceilings; the gold-leafed armchairs, which he bought 30 years ago for $10 apiece and gold-leafed himself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All my family has a black belt in shopping, and we have radar when something is 70 percent off,'' Mr. Hart said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Understood. But why so much?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm just from Texas,'' Ms. Hart said. ''I like it big.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that, of course, is only part of the story.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEIGHBORHOODS change. In the 1940s -- as the Harts point out on their Web site -- Sixth Street, in downtown Las Vegas, was a high-end residential neighborhood, home to Bugsy Siegel and Howard Hughes. Now many of the yards have grimy ''For Sale'' signs, and the neighborhood seems defeated, as if having ceded the battle for gracious living to the suburbs. On the back porch of the Hartland Mansion, a patch of paint hangs from a water-damaged ceiling. Larry Hart, who no longer lives in the house, insists the exterior is ''distressed by choice,'' for security's sake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inside, however, on a visit earlier this month, the house was decked out like a Vegas showgirl. ''Come on over, I'll organize something to eat,'' Mr. Hart had told the reporter, giving the impression of an informal brunch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On arrival, though, it was clear that informal is something the Harts do not do. A round table had been set in the grand foyer with a printed menu, and red napkins were stuffed into black patent-leather stilettos on each plate. Tiny glass slippers had been hot-glued to the side of wineglasses from the local <span class="companylink">Dollar Tree</span> store (a precarious gig for the reporter's slipper, which fell off in her hand). More glass shoes had been glued to a six-foot silver-and-faux-candle candelabra.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My shoe-delier,'' said Mr. Hart, 50, who was decked out entirely in black, complete with a black cowboy hat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Hart, slim and raven-haired at 82, wore a tailored black suit trimmed with two dozen gold-plated teddy bears. ''Larry did this,'' she said, referring to the trim.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I like gluing things to other things,'' Mr. Hart said, by now stating the obvious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also at lunch was his brother, Garry, a 48-year-old contractor (''The normal one, like Marilyn in 'The Munsters,' '' Larry said), and Garry's son, Daniel, who was about to turn 9.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the course of the next two days, with time out for a little piano (played by Larry Hart, who performed his composition ''Big Hair Gets You Closer to God'') and some cowbell playing (by Toni Hart, who plays 17 instruments), they told the story of Hartland, which is also the story of the Hart family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It begins in the 1930s in Dallas, where Toni grew up in a nice big house because her daddy was in the oil-trucking business. At 16, a musically talented girl who hauled her accordion to prayer meetings, she married Ralph Hart, a ''gorgeous'' 22-year-old preacher and musician. They soon began their traveling tent-show and trailer life and in time had three children, Linda, the eldest, then Larry and Garry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It might have looked like a glamorous life, when the entire family was dressed in white suits, singing gospel to big crowds, but actually it was not glamorous at all, Ms. Hart said, especially in the beginning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Back in those days, in order to preach the gospel, we were sleeping in the back of our car,'' she said. ''There were lot of places in Louisiana where they'd have a room on the back of the church that was screened in, no sheet, no pillow. We were starving evangelists. All my vegetables were in cans, 10 cents a can. Every day I drove a water hose through the tent to keep the dust down.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her charismatic husband, from whom she has been divorced since 1979, was, in her opinion, far too charismatic when it came to women.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a video the family was shopping for a reality television show, ''The Harts of Las Vegas,'' which can be seen on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>, Ms. Hart said that she named her furs after her husband's girlfriends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When did she first realize there was a problem?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The first time I caught him was in Lubbock, Texas, with a preacher's wife,'' Ms. Hart said. ''I looked out the big glass window and saw this preacher's wife open the prayer room door, and she went like this'' -- she made a ''C'mere, good-looking'' gesture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I very slowly walked down the aisle,'' she continued. ''He had her up against the wall, and they were just having a good time. I said, 'What on earth are you doing?' He was good to apologize, very humbled. It just about ruined the revival.'' (Mr. Hart could not be reached for comment. Linda Hart said he was in poor health.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The family, who recorded at least two dozen gospel albums, performed across the country and in Europe, and Mr. Hart founded a church in Detroit. But since Larry was a weak, asthmatic child, Ms. Hart sought cities with drier, warmer climates, like Nashville. Larry said that his asthma was so bad that, if he tried to bounce a ball, he ended up in intensive care. The cortisone treatment he took made him fat, which helped him win a part on the television show ''Hee Haw'' when he was 12 or 13, but he was not happy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The little time I had in school,'' he said, ''I was the one who never got picked for anything -- the outsider, most certainly the ugly and fat duckling. Part of the attraction to the shiny and beautiful is maybe an externalization, maybe feeling there was nothing I could do about me.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hart showed a talent for ornamentation at a very early age. Stuck in the family's trailer, he began decorating his mother's shoes with pearls. In his early teens, he adorned shoes for Ginger Rogers, Debbie Reynolds and Dolly Parton.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Welcome to my shiny world. And if your world is not particularly glittering, buy some Aleene's Tacky Glue and apply your own glitter and shine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1976 -- by which time Linda had gone off on her own and was performing with the New Christy Minstrels -- Ms. Hart and her two younger children arrived in Las Vegas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The first city I really got better in and got off the cortisone,'' said Mr. Hart, who was about 17 then.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I had hired Mike Stone, Priscilla Presley's karate man, to work with Larry,'' Ms. Hart said. ''In three months, he got 75 pounds off him.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May 1978, they came upon the property where their house stands today. At the time, there were two interconnected houses on it, heavy with gingerbread, which reminded Ms. Hart of the big Texas homes of her youth. On impulse, she knocked on the door to see if it might be for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The woman who answered was the bail bondsman for the owner, who had just gotten out of jail and skipped the country,'' Mr. Hart said. ''The woman said, 'Do I have a deal for you.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The departed owner was Lawrence Arvey, who had been sentenced to life for sex crimes but was out on bond. ''The man had parties here all the time -- Elvis was supposed to have been a guest,'' Mr. Hart said. ''He's never been found.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Harts got the property for $190,000, but a few years later, the houses were destroyed in a fire. They rebuilt, doing much of the carpentry themselves, financing it with insurance money and by working Las Vegas lounge acts. ''We're performing at Caesar's Palace on Cleopatra's barge, singing Donna Summers' 'Bad Girls,' '' Larry said. ''And there is my gospel-singing, Pentecostal mother doing, 'Toot toot, hey, beep, beep.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the most part, the family followed a rough blueprint of the original houses, rebuilding the five fireplaces and the room in which Elvis was said to have stayed. The grand atrium that joined the two structures and its twin curving staircases was a Hart addition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Mom always wanted a double circular staircase. I said, 'Ma, unless you want to be Mrs. Winchester, you need to put something at the top of the stairs,' '' said Larry, in a reference to the Winchester rifle heiress who built a home with dozens of staircases, many of which led nowhere. ''There are two apartment suites on either side up there. The right is my brother's, the left is mine.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The elaborate plasterwork throughout the house -- much of it overlaid on ready-made plaster pillars, cherubim from garden and craft stores and inexpensive mirror frames -- is Larry's work, inspired by a book on Versailles. ''As I looked at those pictures, it just struck me that it looked like a giant wedding cake,'' he said. ''I went out and got a cake decorating kit and started playing with different compounds of plaster and spackle to find something that would hold vertically on a ceiling. And once I came up with the right mix, I went to town.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Harts also kept an eye out for bargains. The headboard of Ms. Hart's bed, which cost $15, came from a sale held after the disastrous MGM Grand hotel fire in 1980, as did her bedside lamps, which cost $10 each and were black with soot when Larry spotted them. (He soaked them in diluted glass cleaner.) The sconces in the hall were $5.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two of the Hart children have since gone off on their own. Linda became a backup singer for Bette Midler and a Broadway actress, appearing in ''Hairspray'' and the Broadway-bound ''Catch Me If You Can,'' and now lives in Los Angeles and New York. Larry won a Grammy for best gospel performance in 1978, and got a place in Los Angeles, where he continued to compose and perform. But in 1999, he moved back to Hartland for several years, bringing with him some of his collections, including 350 Faberge-style eggs and dozens of Christmas nutcrackers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Hart began renting out the house for weddings in the mid-'80s, though she also officiated at Las Vegas chapels. She's had her share of celebrities but is proud to say she's always been discreet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I did Ryan O'Neal's son, Griffin,'' she said. ''The next day, The National Enquirer called me to ask was the fiancee pregnant. She was definitely pregnant, but I didn't tell them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But weddings can be grueling, and disgruntled modern brides, aided by the Internet, vicious. ''Totally run-down, tacky fake flowers everywhere, roaches, brought-in food and located in a horrible part of town with no outside ambience,'' groused one, under the name travilyaya, on tripadvisor.com, with the heading ''Do NOT Do It There.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That review hurt Ms. Hart horribly -- it was ''not remotely accurate,'' she said. But since she is getting on and is sick of mopping all those floors, she recently put the Hartland Mansion up for sale, for $8.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Larry, who now runs an events company called Botanica Las Vegas with his partner, Michael Flach, lives in a town house in the suburbs, and Ms. Hart often stays at her condo at the Las Vegas Country Club. The 34-pound bedspread in her grand bedroom at the Hartland Mansion is too heavy for her, she said, and when she does stay there, she sleeps in a workroom littered with bills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only family member who still lives at Hartland full time is Garry, in a suite off limits to reporters and reportedly utterly free of pearls.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">New-Home Sales Plunged To Record Low in January</span>
</div><div class="author">By DAVID STREITFELD  and JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ </div><div>736 words</div><div>25 February 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sickly housing market was socked with another dose of bad news on Wednesday when the Commerce Department reported that new home sales fell in January to the lowest level since record-keeping began in 1963.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost as disturbing was the continuing reluctance of people to apply for mortgages. The Mortgage Bankers Association said applications for loans to buy homes dropped last week to the lowest level in 13 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By all rights, the housing market should be doing much better. Prices have fallen substantially in the last three years, mortgage rates are very low by historical standards and the government is giving all sorts of buyers a cash bonus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This should be an ideal time for people to buy,'' said Brad Hunter, chief economist of Metrostudy, a housing consultant. ''And yet they're hesitating.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">January's 11.2 percent drop in new-home sales to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 309,000 came as a surprise to analysts, who had forecast an increase of 3.5 percent. It was the third consecutive month that sales fell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The previous bottom was January 2009, after Wall Street crashed and there was considerable talk of another Great Depression. Wall Street has largely recovered and the depression talk has abated, but sales last month still fell 6 percent below the earlier trough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That does not bode well for the expiration of tax credits for home buyers this spring, especially if mortgage rates rise to anything like their traditional levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's going to be a very tough summer,'' Mr. Hunter said. ''You're not going to have a robust housing market until you have more jobs, and you're not going to add jobs fast enough to bring down the unemployment rate until you have a robust housing market.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists generally do not give too much weight to new-home sales data, which is taken from a small sample size. But analysts said Wednesday that the downward trend was troubling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When one considers the billions and trillions of dollars that have been spent to prop up the housing market, that the best we could muster is a new low in sales is incredibly worrisome,'' wrote Dan Greenhaus, chief economic strategist for <span class="companylink">Miller Tabak</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the fall, new-home sales climbed rapidly as consumers rushed to take advantage of the $8,000 tax credit for first-time home buyers, which was originally set to expire at the end of November. But as soon as Congress extended the credit through April 30, sales began struggling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists expected a second surge in sales at the beginning of this year as the April deadline approached. But with January's numbers so low, and consumer confidence weakening, several said they were revising their forecasts and discounting the effect of the credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We thought it was going to kick in and boost sales,'' said Patrick Newport, a housing economist for IHS Global Insight. ''It's a little bit of a shocker.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With so few buyers, inventory is starting to pile up again. This is contrary to what usually happens after a recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said the supply of new homes rose in January to 9.1 months of inventory, up sharply from a recent low of 6.7 months in October. The inventory peak in this cycle was 12.4 months in January 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers do not seem to be flocking to houses in February, either. Applications for mortgages to buy houses fell 7.3 percent last week from the previous week, the Mortgage Bankers Association said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While purchase applications are not a perfect mirror of the housing market -- many foreclosed homes are being bought these days in all-cash deals -- the recent plunge is another sign that the market remains in intensive care. Applications have dropped substantially since October and are now at their lowest level since May 1997.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bankers association said applications for refinances dropped by 8.9 percent. Mortgage rates around 5 percent are apparently not attractive enough for some who wish to refinance. Many others are locked out from applying because they owe more than their homes are now worth.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One River Place blends easily into the dense forest of Manhattan skyscrapers, its vanity address camouflaging its precise location. Still, even in New York City, a 40-story tower containing 900 apartments should be difficult to miss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Census Bureau did.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment building at 500 12th Avenue, between 41st and 42nd Streets, was one of the first residential developments on the western fringes of Hell's Kitchen when it opened in 2000. It was so far west, in fact, that it never showed up on the residential property map the bureau prepared for the 2010 census.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York City planners discovered the oversight and alerted the bureau. Likewise, the city told the bureau about two nearby 60-story buildings with a total of 1,400 apartments that opened last spring after the bureau had finished compiling addresses for this census.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the federal Census Bureau starts its most ambitious effort ever to count the country, no other city presents a bigger challenge than New York, with its huge immigrant population crammed into easily missed and often illegal nooks and crannies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all, the city has provided Census officials the addresses of at least 127,000 apartments or homes -- nearly 4 percent of all the housing in the city -- that the bureau did not have. Most of the addresses are in one-, two- and three-family homes that had been subdivided, legally and illegally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A decade ago, 55 percent of the census forms in New York were sent back, compared with the national rate of 67 percent. In some city neighborhoods, the response rate was less than 40 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As a place of unparalleled population diversity and an eclectic mix of housing types, New York City has always been hard to count,'' said Joseph J. Salvo, director of the population division of New York's Department of City Planning. ''This is especially true in the last decade, when the city experienced voluminous housing growth.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2010 count of New York has not officially begun, but city demographers have already discovered about 300,000 people, including the tenants of those three Manhattan buildings, whom the bureau might have missed because it did not have their addresses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They have also highlighted neighborhoods -- including Washington Heights in Manhattan, Astoria in Queens and Bay Ridge in Brooklyn -- where roughly 600,000 immigrants who arrived over the last decade have settled and how to find them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dozens of city workers have fanned out across the city, tallying mailboxes and doorbells on hundreds of homes where multiple families might be living or where tenants might be squirreled away in illegally converted attics and basements. The Census Bureau needs to ''see behind the door,'' Dr. Salvo said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decennial census is about a lot more than counting heads. The count is vital in reapportioning Congressional and state legislative districts, and in the distribution of billions of dollars in federal aid. This year, everyone will get the same form with just 10 questions, including the names and the number of household residents, their age, sex and race and if they are of Hispanic origin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The questionnaires will be mailed to more than three million New York households in about two weeks and are due back by April 1. Filling out such a short form and returning it in a prepaid envelope might seem simple enough (and takes less time, the bureau says, than hard-boiling an egg).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But mindful of the obstacles, the Census Bureau and New York City officials have embarked on an unprecedented cooperative campaign to increase compliance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bureau's New York regional office has hired 70 workers to reach out to ethnic groups, clergy members and civic groups to help promote the count. It has rolled out a media blitz that includes billboards and vans that have traveled throughout the city. And the bureau is coordinating closely with Dr. Salvo and Stacey Cumberbatch, who is the city's full-time census coordinator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her office has reached out to groups like the United African Congress and the Y.M.C.A.'s New Americans Initiative to brief recent immigrants about the importance of the census.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beginning in late March, the Census Bureau will provide Ms. Cumberbatch with real-time questionnaire return rates by neighborhood so she can dispatch follow-up teams.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is essential that New York City receive an accurate census count, because the census is statistical reality -- a reality that will define us for the next 10 years,'' Dr. Salvo said. ''If you're missed in the census enumeration, it's like you don't exist.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city and the Census Bureau hope to avoid a repeat of the 1990 census, when the city challenged the count and the bureau acknowledged that it had missed more than 240,000 New Yorkers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the bureau relies, in part, on the previous census in compiling its list of residential addresses, its records are often outdated. In some cases, people are living at street addresses, like Riverside Boulevard in Manhattan over former railyards in the West 60s and 70s, that did not even exist in 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time the bureau is aiming for a questionnaire return rate in New York of 70 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are some census tracts that could easily meet that, like the Upper East Side, where there are homeowners, English speakers,'' said Lester A. Farthing, the bureau's New York regional director. ''Our biggest challenge is working on tracts where the mail response was low. You need to saturate New York to get the word out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bureau will open sites throughout the city to help people fill out the questionnaires and to provide forms in various languages -- the mailed forms are in English or, in predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods, in English and Spanish. One key message: None of the information is shared with any other government agencies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our greatest challenge is trying to convince the majority of the foreign-born population that the census is safe, that you're not going to be hurt or harmed,'' Mr. Farthing said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bureau is concentrating on neighborhoods that are considered hard to count because residents are disproportionately poor, unemployed, live in apartment buildings, have no telephones, have moved there recently or are single parents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People who do not respond to the survey will get a follow-up form, and if they ignore that, they will get a visit from an enumerator or census taker; 40,000 were hired in New York in 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you're worried about someone coming to your door,'' Mr. Farthing said, ''the answer is, mail it back.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The City Planning Department has been so aggressive in pursuing people the census might miss that demographers have dubbed it ''the Salvo effect.'' Acting as human bloodhounds, 60 agency workers have spent part of the past three years combing through records and conducting on-site inspections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's amazing how many cable TV lines go into a house where one family supposedly lives,'' Dr. Salvo said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2000, the city's population officially topped eight million for the first time, thanks largely to the Salvo effect. In 2008, the population stood at 8,363,710, according to the bureau's annual American Community Survey. Dr. Salvo expects the 2010 census to record 8.4 million residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To find overlooked New Yorkers, researchers even considered using water bills to estimate how many times toilets were flushed and gauge population based on average human needs. But, Dr. Salvo said, ''That is too unreliable, from an empirical standpoint.''</p>

</div><div class="author">By DAVID STREITFELD </div><div>828 words</div><div>24 February 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The wobbly state of the housing market was made clear on Tuesday with the release of data showing that home prices managed a modest increase in December even as many more Americans owed more on their properties than they were worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller index of home prices in 20 metropolitan areas rose 0.3 percent in December on a seasonally adjusted basis, with most of the cities improving from November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the seventh consecutive month that the index showed rising prices, a welcome respite after several years of wrenching declines. But another 600,000 households slipped underwater during the fourth quarter, with their homes valued at less than their mortgages, according to the data firm First American CoreLogic, a real estate research company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The total number of households with negative equity is now 11.3 million, or 24 percent of all residential properties with mortgages, up from 23 percent in the third quarter, First American said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Negative equity is a major concern among policy makers because it can compel disillusioned borrowers to forsake their properties, contributing to the foreclosure problem. The breaking point for homeowners, research shows, is when negative equity reaches about 25 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five million people are now at or beyond that point, First American estimates, up from 4.5 million in the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The research firm recalibrated its data in the third quarter, which means earlier negative equity numbers are not comparable. But it said that the number of severely underwater borrowers was growing even faster than it expected a few weeks ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Home prices in the worst areas -- Florida, Nevada and Arizona -- fell more than we had expected, increasing the amount of negative equity,'' a First American senior economist, Sam Khater, said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First American's home price index, released last week, fell for both December and the fourth quarter. That contrasted with the improving Case-Shiller numbers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two firms measure different groups of homeowners using different methodologies. The disparate results indicate how difficult it is at the moment to get a fix on the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a widespread feeling among analysts that the market is being kept afloat by the government's emergency measures, especially the tax credit for buyers. The market's true level will become apparent only after the tax credit ends in the spring -- assuming it is not renewed as it was in the fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices in the West Coast cities tracked by Case-Shiller, including Los Angeles, Phoenix and San Diego, increased the most in December. Laggards were Chicago, New York and Tampa, Fla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The recovery has slowed since the summer months, but it has not completely fallen apart,'' Maureen Maitland, S.&amp;P.'s vice president for index services, said. ''We're in a bit of a flat period.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Las Vegas, the worst hit of all the major housing markets, managed its second consecutive monthly gain. ''Vegas was so battered there is now a tiny bit of hope,'' Ms. Maitland said. ''You can only fall so much.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the case of Las Vegas, that was apparently a drop of 57 percent from its peak. Seven of 10 homeowners with mortgages in Nevada owe more on their properties than they are worth, according to the First American data. In Arizona and Florida, about half the owners are underwater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Further price declines could give many of these owners the impetus to walk away. If interest rates rise and the tax credit is not renewed, another slump is expected. Nationally, prices are already about where they were in summer 2003. Further declines could add up to a lost decade for housing prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist for MFR Inc., said he expected the market to drop after the tax credit expired. At that point, he said, ''more of the true fundamentals will come through on pricing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the spring, the seasonal adjustment factors will tend to weigh on Case-Shiller prices, rather than bolster them as they do now. Without the adjustments, most of the cities in the index fell in December. The composite dropped 0.2 percent for the second consecutive month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On an annual basis, the 20-city index was down 3.1 percent. That figure has improved consistently for a year. Only three cities -- Detroit, Tampa and Las Vegas -- are still showing double-digit annual declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The quarterly return for the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller index of national home prices, which incorporates data from a broader slice of the country, was also released on Tuesday. That index fell 2.5 percent in the fourth quarter compared with the same period in 2008.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">City's New Plan on Affordable Housing: Build Less, Preserve More</span>
</div><div class="author">By CARA BUCKLEY </div><div>661 words</div><div>22 February 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>14</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has changed the blueprint of his affordable housing plan to preserve more such homes but build fewer of them, a shift that nonetheless will still cost the city $1 billion more than originally anticipated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The revamped New Housing Marketplace Plan, as the initiative is called, will now cost $8.5 billion to create or preserve 165,000 affordable homes by 2014, city officials said. Most of the extra funds will come from the city's Housing Development Corporation, which issues bonds for the housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city plans to ensure that an additional 32,000 units stay affordable for the next 30 years or so, protecting vulnerable lower-income New Yorkers from the next housing boom. In 2005, the city said it would build 92,000 units and preserve 73,000 by 2014. Now, it expects to build 60,000 and preserve 105,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city's definition of preserving affordable apartments means that its housing agencies refinance and renovate buildings in return for keeping rents locked in for long periods, usually decades, as opposed to letting the units rent or sell at market rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the affordable units that the city plans to concentrate on will be occupied by New Yorkers who earn less than 80 percent of the area's median income. Affordability means that 30 percent or less of their wages would go to rent. Rafael E. Cestero, the city's housing commissioner, said that mortgages of many of the affordable rental buildings built in the 1980s were coming due, giving the city a chance to issue new ones with long-term affordability as a condition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bloomberg plans to formally announce the shift and the funding increase in a speech on Monday at the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing crash and the freeze in credit markets helped prompt the shift in policy, city officials said. Banks are still slow to pay for new construction or write mortgages, and many higher-priced affordable homes that the city helped finance during the boom years continue to sit unsold. The city will still build new homes, but the cost of doing so has risen, meaning that their investment will yield fewer units, a spokesman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City officials said the soft market made preservation more viable. During the real estate boom, many affordable apartments were lost, often after speculators bought buildings, raised rents and drove longtime tenants out, undercutting headway the city had made toward its 165,000-unit goal. (It is nearly at the 100,000-unit mark.) Landlords and potential new owners have fewer financing options now compared with the days of the housing boom, when private equity investors were clamoring to enter the real estate market. This gives the city a window of opportunity, officials said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The extra money will go toward allowing us to save projects that otherwise would've gone to market rates, and keeping rents low, and locking that in 30 or 40 years,'' Mr. Cestero said. ''We have the opportunity right now to step in at a way that we weren't able to before.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing advocates praised the plan. The loss of existing affordable homes throughout the city has long been one of their prime concerns, not least for the negative effects that displacement has on families and communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've always advocated for more preservation because it costs less, and because preserving apartments typically makes them more available to lower-income households than new construction,'' said Tom Waters, a housing policy analyst at the Community Service Society of New York, an advocacy group for the poor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Housing Development Corporation has stayed financially healthy despite the economic crash. It has received strong credit ratings and was the second biggest affordable-housing lender in 2009, according to the trade magazine Affordable Housing Finance.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some Security</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a Tenant</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QThe lease on the house we are renting expired, and we have not received a renewal lease. We've discovered that the house is in foreclosure and that the bank expects a quick sale. If we use our security deposit as our last rent payment, can the bank kick us out?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Edward Josephson, the interim housing director for Queens Legal Services in Jamaica, said that tenants are not legally entitled to use their security deposit to pay their rent because the deposit is intended to cover any damage to the apartment caused by the tenant. But he said recent amendments to both state and federal law require a buyer at foreclosure to give a tenant 90 days' notice before starting an eviction proceeding. So the writer should be able to remain in her apartment for at least that amount of time after the foreclosure sale. Once the eviction proceeding is started, however, the tenant can be required to pay any rent arrears that are due if the tenant asks the court for permission to remain in the apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Short-Term Rentals</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Stabilized Building</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QI am a rent-stabilized tenant in a building in Manhattan in which some of the apartments are not regulated. Recently, the owner has been using empty apartments as short-term, furnished rentals. Is there anything about this situation that could affect my rights as a stabilized tenant?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A ''The letter writer has nothing to fear,'' said Thomas P. Higgins, a Manhattan landlord-tenant lawyer. He said the writer's apartment would remain subject to rent stabilization even if the owner changed the nature of the building by offering short-term vacation rentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parking Perils</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a Condo</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QI am buying a condo in Brooklyn that comes with a parking spot. The spot I am getting is designated as ''handicap parking'' and I do not qualify for that. What are my responsibilities?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Matthew J. Leeds, a Manhattan real estate lawyer and adjunct professor at Fordham Law School, said that under the building code, every parking area, even one in a private condominium, has to have a certain number of specially designated spots available for use by handicapped drivers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The good news is that the questioner can use the assigned spot, which is probably wider than others and nearer the entrance,'' Mr. Leeds said. ''The potential annoying news is that if one of the other unit owners needs handicapped parking, the condominium is obligated to make the questioner's spot available to that person and then assign him the spot opened up by the person needing special access.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rebates</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Veterans</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QThe co-op building I live in has a handful of apartments that get veteran tax rebates, which are then deducted from their maintenance. But while all these shareholders have since passed away, the new owners still get the rebates. Shouldn't rebates be stopped upon death, and how can a co-op ensure that this is done?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Robert Grant, the director of Midboro Management in Manhattan, said management should review the annual rebate accounting provided by the city's Department of Finance to make sure that only apartments entitled to rebates are getting them. If discrepancies are found, they should be reported. JAY ROMANO</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">2 Lakes, the Shore and a Train to the City</span>
</div><div class="author">By JILL P. CAPUZZO </div><div>1567 words</div><div>21 February 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NOT long after moving to Matawan, Elizabeth Renner's children, Nicholas and Maria, found their local park in bad shape and decided to do something about it. With playmates, they circulated a petition, ran a lemonade stand and raised $169, which they handed over at a Borough Council meeting, urging the officials in attendance to fix the park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The council members returned the money, and within a year had installed new equipment. The lesson the children took from the experience, their mother said, in many ways defines Matawan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They found out in a small town, your voice can be heard,'' said Mrs. Renner, describing the close-knit nature of the town she moved to in 2004, after marrying Steve Renner, who grew up in this Monmouth County borough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another transplant, Ken Colon, was similarly impressed by the sense of community he found last fall after he and his fiancee, Rachel Bragg, bought a house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was a culture shock to him,'' said Ms. Bragg of Mr. Colon, who moved to town from Bloomfield in Essex County. ''When he walked into town to talk about taxes and utilities and people were saying, 'Hi,' he didn't even realize they were talking to him.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Matawan appeals to a wide variety of residents, partly because of an excellent transportation network but also for its wealth of natural resources, including two lakes and the Matawan Creek. The latter became part of New Jersey lore in 1916 after a shark made its way inland and killed a young boy swimming in the creek, as well as a would-be rescuer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'd say it's pretty much divided between those who are here because of its proximity to the city and the shore, and the group that's been here since Columbus,'' said William Garofalo, the borough administrator, describing the old-timers among the 8,900 or so residents as ''the bedrock of Matawan.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A clan in that camp, Beth Hopkins's family, has lived here for 70 years. Ms. Hopkins's father, Stockton Hopkins, was borough historian for many years, and she a member of the Matawan Historical Society, based in the 1723 Burrowes Mansion, which bears bullet holes said to date to the Revolution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The still rather old-fashioned downtown that adjoins the Matawan-Aberdeen train station is an area of contention because of commuter traffic to and from the station, the main link to New York for several towns in the region. But the mayor, Paul Buccellato, emphasizes that the downtown is a place in transition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seven years ago, Matawan was named a <span class="companylink">New Jersey Transit</span> Village, a designation that allows it access to financing and expertise for transit-related development. And, as Mayor Buccellato pointed out, ''The train station brings people through town, which is a positive for the borough.'' He is trying to find builders for a retail and residential project near the station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are those like Karen Bull, who moved here from Brooklyn after swearing she'd never leave the city, who appreciate the urban feel of a busy downtown, mixed with the village-like atmosphere of a small town.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's the best of both worlds,'' said Ms. Bull, whose three-bedroom colonial cost $245,000 seven years ago. ''I can walk in my backyard and get that quiet, far-away feeling. And then there's a <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span> just a block away.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT YOU'LL FIND</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just 2.4 square miles in size, Matawan is informally divided into several neighborhoods largely defined by its two lakes, Lefferts and Matawan, and the two major highways that bisect Matawan, Routes 79 and 34. In recent years, properties facing the lakes have gained value, particularly in Edgemere Heights, with older homes on larger properties near Lake Lefferts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the Renners moved to Matawan in 2004, they paid $275,000 for a small house built in the 1800s with low ceilings and one closet, but on a large lot backing up to Lake Lefferts. Last year, they sold that house and moved into a 3,000-square-foot house they built next door after subdividing the property. Ms. Renner, skeptical about moving to Matawan at first, now says she would live nowhere else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a very cool, old-school kind of town,'' she said. ''The houses are not all the same square boxes. We can walk into town or to the train station. My kids ice skate across the lake to get to their friends' houses.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barbara Tuttle, a broker with ReMax Champions in Matawan and a 45-year resident, said she sold a house last fall to a young couple who had stopped by her table at the annual street fair in the Lochslea Heights neighborhood, which has an eclectic mix of smaller Capes and ranches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All the neighbors were out,'' she said, ''and they said they just loved the energy of the community and bought the house that day.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another affordable neighborhood is called Green and White Village, because all its houses were painted white with green shutters when they were built in the 1940s. Since then, most have been repainted and many redone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The expanded Cape that Ms. Bragg and Mr. Colon bought last October for $370,000 is in the Freneau section -- a hilly, wooded area named after the Revolutionary War poet Philip Freneau, who lived here and is buried in the neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Matawan's oldest buildings can be found along Main Street. There are 18th-century mansions as well as grand Victorians, some converted for commercial use. The newest homes are the 157 condominiums at the Preserve at Matawan on Route 79, which opened last year. There are also several rental complexes as well as an adult community, Cheesequake Village.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT YOU'LL PAY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with some neighboring communities, where new development drove up prices that then fell during the recession, Matawan has seen a less precipitous price drop. Donna Bruno, an agent at Coldwell Banker, ascribes that in part to limited development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There isn't a lot of opportunity for future growth here,'' said Ms. Bruno, who grew up in Matawan, ''because they don't have that land available. That helps resales tremendously because they don't have the competition of new homes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2009, the average price of the 75 homes sold in Matawan was $323,826, versus $336,751 for the 47 sold in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are 53 houses on the market, ranging in price from $157,000, for a three-bedroom fixer-upper built in 1920 to $499,900 for a five-bedroom three-bath ranch built in 1975.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Larger colonials, lakefront properties and the few newer homes list for $350,000 to $500,000, while the smaller Capes, split-levels and ranches in areas like Lochslea Heights sell for $250,000 to $400,000, Ms. Bruno said. The one-, two- and three-bedroom condos at the Preserve at Matawan start at $269,990.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE COMMUTE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Matawan-Aberdeen station serves most of western Monmouth County, offering a direct line to New York City, with commuting times ranging from 59 to 70 minutes. Matawan is also just off Exit 117 of the Garden State Parkway, which -- traffic depending -- gets you into the city in 50 to 60 minutes. <span class="companylink">New Jersey Transit</span>'s 133 Line provides bus service to Port Authority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT TO DO</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Activity is focused on the lakes, and on Raritan Bay. Lake Lefferts, the site of the borough's Fourth of July fireworks display, is popular for skating, fishing and canoeing. A park at its north end has fishing docks and canoe and kayak rentals. Cheesequake State Park in neighboring Old Bridge offers boating and swimming in the Raritan Bay, as well as camping. The closest ocean beach, Sandy Hook, is 13 miles away; beaches like Belmar and Spring Lake are about a half-hour's drive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Matawan's downtown has several bars and restaurants, and shopping is available along Routes 34 and 79, just outside of town. One popular restaurant is the Buttonwood Manor facing Lake Lefferts, a site of celebratory events for decades. The First Baptist Church on Main Street has pancake breakfasts and seasonal festivals throughout the year. The Burrowes Mansion, also on Main Street, offers conducted tours and historical re-enactments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE SCHOOLS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The high and middle schools of the Matawan-Aberdeen Regional School District cover both communities. SAT averages at Matawan Regional High School last year were 499 in math, 489 in reading and 490 in writing, versus 514, 492 and 494 statewide. The high school football team won the state division championship in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elementary students are divided among the Cliffwood, Strathmore, Ravine Drive and Lloyd Road schools.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE HISTORY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Founded in 1686 by a group of Scottish Presbyterians, Matawan was originally part of the shipping settlement of Middletown Point, on Raritan Bay. In the 1800s the area was home to two piano factories, two tile factories, a basket factory and a lime kiln that processed oyster shells from nearby Keyport.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN the practical sense, of course, it matters little what architectural label is slapped on a house in a real estate listing. A ''Cape Cod'' called a ''Cotswold cottage'' or a ''center-hall colonial'' has its list of attributes and drawbacks, regardless. Nor does its property tax bill go up or down based on its description.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even a purist like Peter A. Primavera, a cultural anthropologist by training and a historic preservationist by trade, concedes that this is so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a free country,'' said Mr. Primavera, whose company, the Cultural Resource and Consulting Group, is in Highland Park. ''I guess people have a right to toss terminology around without knowing what they are talking about -- even real estate agents.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An agent listing a house is, in fact, free to write whatever he wants in the ''remarks'' section of a multiple-listing form. As for a style designation, though, the New Jersey Multiple Listing Service asks agents to choose from a menu of categories: colonial, Cape Cod, bilevel, split-level, contemporary and ranch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Agents can then choose a ''substyle'' designation from another list. For example, a colonial may be secondarily classified as center-hall, Georgian, Tudor, Victorian, side-hall, French Provincial, other or none. The categories were drawn up by real estate agents who are members of the listing service, a spokeswoman said. When faced with the menu, listing agents untutored in architecture nearly always choose ''colonial,'' agents and housing specialists said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Absolutely everything is a colonial, and especially a center-hall colonial,'' said Sam Joseph, an agent with Re/Max Village Square. ''It's hysterical, but that's the way the game is played.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Joseph, who attended art school in London before becoming a real estate salesman in northern New Jersey, said he had seen everything from a Queen Anne-style house to a Dutch colonial described as a center-hall colonial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such descriptions are generally perceived as referring to the look of a house, and not its actual provenance -- as, for example, the Colonial era ended in 1776, and the Victorian era in the early 20th century. Even so, it is ''kind of wacky'' the way the colonial designation prevails, said Martin Schwartz, a builder whose Montclair company, Textured Home, specializes in updating older houses without stripping them of ''authenticity.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Calling something a colonial appears to mean it has four walls and a peaked roof,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Creating a listing last spring for a pretty blue house on the market in Jackson, Dawn Ciccone, an agent with Diane Turton Realtors, started as she usually does with ''colonial,'' and as a substyle chose ''Victorian.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house in question, with stylistic elements reminiscent of both architectural eras but clearly belonging to neither, was built as part of a subdivision in 1996. Although Ms. Ciccone's listing for a ''beautiful Victorian colonial'' is a contradiction in terms to people like Mr. Schwartz and Mr. Primavera, she said she had relied primarily on the description supplied by the seller. ''It's not a real Victorian,'' she acknowledged. ''There are very few of those in the Jackson area. But it does have that look, with the gabled roof and the porches.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, merely having the look of something does not suffice for people like John K. Turpin, the retired president of Turpin Realtors, who co-wrote the two-volume ''New Jersey Country Houses: The Somerset Hills'' (Mountain Colony Press, 2005), and has another book in the works on Morris County homes. Mr. Turpin described some real estate descriptions of home styles as ''cringe-worthy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My own company shares the burden of trying to be accurate, if not necessarily scholarly, with its promotional material,'' he said, acknowledging that ''things do slip through, because most real estate agents haven't got a clue about architecture.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One Turpin Realtors listing, for instance -- an 18,000-square-foot estate on a private peninsula of the Navesink River in Rumson -- might or might not be an example of misnomer-ism. The house, listed for $29.9 million, is described as ''a masterwork of shingle style architecture.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Primavera counts himself among those specialists who see ''shingle'' as a type of exterior wall covering rather than an architectural style. But Mr. Turpin noted that references to shingle style architecture are easily found online and in scholarly works.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both men do agree on the need for more descriptive precision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On its Web site, njmls.com, the listing service offers a link to a basic primer on architectural styles. And some brokers and agents do try to learn about particular houses or styles on their own, just because they are interested, Mr. Turpin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some do research in concert with local historical societies, attend classes and lectures, and gain expertise, he said. More often, however, he has seen examples of real estate professionals' helping to perpetuate ''myths'' about house history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Turpin recalled how -- ''at the last possible moment'' before his first book went to print -- his writing partner called from the New York Public Library to say he had just managed to uncover an old photograph that debunked local ''Realtor lore'' attributing a house on Mendham-Bernardsville Road to Stanford White.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Arguably the most famous architect of the Gilded Age, White is supposed to have designed houses in ''nearly every community, on every other street corner, according to Realtors,'' Mr. Schwartz said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Well,'' he concluded, ''at least that shows people can get excited about architecture -- even if they don't always have the facts straight.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHOTO: HYBRID HOUSE: A house in Jackson was described by a listing agent as a ''Victorian colonial,'' though students of architecture would argue that it fits into neither category. (PHOTOGRAPH BY RYAN COLLERD FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FOR most of her time at New York University School of Law, Mari K. Bonthuis lived in a postwar high-rise co-op on 14th Street near First Avenue. Her parents bought the alcove studio for her in 2003 for $250,000. About two years ago, ''when I was no longer a broke law student,'' Ms. Bonthuis said, she bought them out for the same price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her L-shaped home, at around 550 square feet, ''was big enough for one girl and one cat,'' said Ms. Bonthuis, 31, a native of Anoka, Minn., and a graduate of St. Olaf College in Northfield. Still, ''it would be fair to say there was no room to grow.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She wanted more space -- especially more closet space. She was interested in a newer bathroom and kitchen, too. Hers had the original metal cabinets from 1963.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She thought about renovating. ''I was daunted by the process,'' said Ms. Bonthuis, now a litigation associate at a law firm. ''I don't have time to pick out tile and bathroom fixtures.'' She even considered moving her mother in for a few weeks to oversee the work. But a renovation would never provide sufficient closet space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, last spring, Ms. Bonthuis decided to hunt for a new home, knowing that in the weak market she could upgrade to a one-bedroom. She aimed for a price of around $600,000, preferably in a building with more charm than her old one. Chelsea, an easy trip to her office in Midtown West, was her neighborhood of choice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She fell for a ''super-adorable duplex'' in a small walk-up co-op on West 25th Street for $595,000. It had around 600 square feet, exposed brick, a working fireplace and a window seat. Monthly maintenance was nearly $700.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the apartment was substantially overpriced, according to Ms. Bonthuis's agent, Susan Fishman of Prudential Douglas Elliman, who was referred by a colleague. Nor was it clear that all of Ms. Bonthuis's furniture and bookcases would fit in the living room. ''I didn't think it was worth moving for only 50 square feet more,'' she said. ''And my mom balked at visiting me in a fourth-floor walk-up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Bonthuis increased her price range, knowing there was room to negotiate downward. ''I saw every single one-bedroom priced under $800,000 in Chelsea until I started ruling out certain buildings,'' she said. Insufficient closet space was her primary reason.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Sometimes it is hard to find closets together with prewar charm and personality,'' Ms. Fishman said. ''We would walk through apartments and count closets.'' Walk-ups rarely had enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even new condominiums seemed to skimp on closets, ''which I thought was ridiculous,'' Ms. Bonthuis said. ''Why would you build a new condo with only two closets? Just because you are across the street from Manhattan Mini Storage does not mean you do not need more storage.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She also disliked the open kitchens common to new construction. ''I feel like you don't want your couch close to your kitchen,'' she said. ''The kitchen ends up eating into the living-room space. I need my desk and my 40-inch TV and my couch. I need all the room I can get.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A one-bedroom for $675,000 was available in the Chelsea Mews building on West 23rd Street. It was hard to gain access to see the apartment. ''We tried to get in for a month and they kept changing the appointment time,'' Ms. Fishman said. ''This apartment was on the horizon for so long, and it was everything we thought it would be.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The maintenance was almost $1,400 a month, and Ms. Bonthuis felt the price should be lower to compensate. She offered $585,000, but found the sellers hard to deal with. ''They wouldn't counteroffer,'' she said. ''They wouldn't even tell me what I needed to offer in order to get a counteroffer. I don't know how to negotiate like that. You need to give people numbers to get to, and I felt like we were swimming.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Negotiations went nowhere. The apartment remains on the market for $629,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An apartment on 23rd Street and Eighth Avenue was available for $659,000. Ms. Fishman thought ''how odd it was to have a 13th floor.'' It had the only open kitchen that Ms. Bonthuis didn't mind, because it was tucked around a corner rather than intruding upon the living space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But again the high maintenance, around $1,500, was a deterrent. That apartment remains on the market at the same price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three good choices surfaced at Chelsea Gardens, a 1939 Art Deco building that stretches between 23rd and 24th Streets, near Eighth Avenue, surrounding a pretty courtyard. The one-bedrooms had about 800 square feet. One, for $699,000, faced 23rd Street but seemed noisy. Another, for $799,000, had a dark kitchen with a black floor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The third had a newly renovated kitchen and four deep closets. It was listed at $795,000, but Ms. Bonthuis bought it for $748,500. Monthly maintenance is slightly over $1,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She moved in just before Thanksgiving, selling her old place for $370,000 to a first-time buyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By coincidence, the duplex on West 25th Street ended up selling to a good friend, Lauren Steinberg, 30, who had been renting an alcove studio in a postwar high-rise on East 15th Street. ''I don't want to be 35 and living in a studio,'' said Ms. Steinberg, a stock trader.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That apartment had gone off the market and then reappeared for $499,000. Ms. Steinberg was surprised to get into a bidding war, which she won, paying $518,000. Maintenance is nearly $700.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Ms. Bonthuis misses the restaurants in her old neighborhood, though she cooks more often, thanks to her nice kitchen. She can fit 12 for dinner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her cat, named Nancy Pelosi, is happy in her new home, too. Doves perch on the fire escapes in the courtyard, so ''every day at dusk there is an hour of quality dove-watching time for Nancy P.,'' Ms. Bonthuis said. It is a nice change from the occasional pigeon she formerly glimpsed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Bonthuis now has a quick commute to work -- the subway trip is ''two songs on my iPod,'' she said -- though the walk up Eighth Avenue, among liquor stores and porn shops, is less than compelling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I keep finding excuses to work from home,'' Ms. Bonthuis said. She revels in her abundant closet space. No longer must she store her suitcases behind the couch or under the bed. She has room for cleaning supplies, an ironing board and ''all the stuff that people have,'' she said. ''The tour of my apartment begins with the closets.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LOS ANGELES -- LIKE almost every other American architect who came to prominence in the recent gilded age, Michael Maltzan built his reputation with commissions for prestigious museums and luxurious private houses. In 2002 he garnered national attention for his graceful design for the temporary Museum of Modern Art in Queens. His most recent projects include a flying-saucer-like house for the artists Lari Pittman and Roy Dowell in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains and a far grander, 28,000-square-foot Beverly Hills mansion -- part art gallery, part home -- for the investor and former Hollywood uber-agent Michael Ovitz.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet Mr. Maltzan may be the only American architect of his stature with significant experience in a far less glamorous field: providing shelter and other accommodations for his city's poor. Over the past 16 years he has worked on several housing projects for the homeless and an arts complex for underprivileged children that are remarkable for their architectural sophistication and their spirit of public service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His newest building, the Carver Apartments, a drum-shaped residential complex, strikes a tricky balance between two fundamental and often conflicting needs of the chronically homeless, for a sense of being protected, on the one hand, and regular human contact on the other. His next project, an elegant composition of prefabricated blocks that is still in the design phase, could make that nuanced approach available to many more people. Together these designs deliver a major blow to the conventional notion of contemporary architecture as little more than an indulgence of the rich or highly cultured.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Maltzan stumbled into the role of socially conscious architect. He arrived in Los Angeles in 1988 and was soon working for Frank Gehry, then still a cult figure for young architects looking for a way out of the malaise of postmodernism. In 1993, while at work on the early stages of the <span class="companylink">Walt Disney</span> Concert Hall design, Mr. Maltzan was approached by Irwin Jaeger, a businessman, and Bob Bates, an artist, to look at a garbage-strewn lot at the edge of Skid Row where they were planning to build a home for Inner City Arts, an after-school program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project became Mr. Maltzan's first solo commission. A complex of studio spaces clustered around landscaped courtyards, its sculptured white stucco buildings and raw interiors evoked the lyrical architectural forms of Alvaro Siza as well as the sculptural compositions of Mr. Gehry's work, suggesting a young architect easing into his own voice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also demonstrated an unusual sensitivity for those who taught and worked there. The comforting scale of the gardens and studios, animated by light funneling through big skylights and windows set at the eye level of a small child, imbue these spaces with a warmth that is rare in low-budget construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project attracted the attention of the Skid Row Housing Trust, an organization dedicated to providing permanent homes for the most vulnerable members of the downtown homeless population -- people with a combination of disabling conditions like drug addictions, mental illnesses and physical disabilities who had drifted in and out of shelters for years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Maltzan's first building for the trust, the Rainbow apartment complex, is surrounded by Skid Row's sprawling encampments. To shelter the tenants from the nearby misery, Mr. Maltzan oriented its 87 apartments around a big ceremonial staircase and an outdoor courtyard. From a shared top-floor terrace, tenants look over toward the glittering towers of the business district a few blocks away, which in this neighborhood can sometimes seem an unreachable oasis of prosperity and calm. The project, completed in 2006, offered a sharp contrast to the soul-crushing atmosphere of more typical homeless shelters, from which many of its tenants had been plucked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People who are in the shelter-shuttle, going from one to another, are relatively anonymous,'' said Mike Alvidrez, the housing trust's director. ''And in an old-fashioned S.R.O., you're sealed off from the outside and each other. Rainbow spawned this whole interaction between people who didn't know one another.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You never know what form it's going to take,'' he added. The kitchen opens onto the courtyard, for example, which promotes outdoor gatherings; the courtyard's planters spawned a gardening club; the community room gave rise to yoga classes and other activities. There are now 15 to 20 clubs operating in the complex.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the time Mr. Alvidrez hired Mr. Maltzan to design the Carver Apartments, a 97-unit building on a corner about a mile away, the group's architectural ambitions had grown in scope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Rainbow triggered a lot of ideas,'' Mr. Alvidrez said. ''What we started to learn is how the design can help people get stabilized as a community. For us the building became part of the recovery.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Carver Apartments were designed to serve the same population as Rainbow, but the context of the new building raises distinct challenges. It stands in the middle of a neighborhood of dilapidated warehouses and empty lots, with an elevated section of the 10 Freeway pressing up against it to the south. On a recent weekday morning the only sign of life on the ground was a homeless man silently setting down his shoes just outside his tent underneath a freeway on-ramp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first glance the building seems to hold itself somewhat aloof from this setting. Its crisp white cylindrical exterior is broken into a series of saw-tooth-like vertical ridges. A pattern of narrow horizontal and vertical windows, designed to keep out the noise and exhaust fumes, contributes to its slightly defensive air.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Mr. Maltzan explained the first time we toured the site: ''One of the first things people do when they live on the street is put up walls around themselves to try to create some feeling of safety. You need to provide those walls before you can start to open things back up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He brings the same level of architectural intelligence to those walls that he does to the design of a mogul's house. The building's curved facade, for example, mirrors the curve of the freeway on-ramp, so that as you approach along one of the two streets that border it, the curves seem to converge, creating a sense of acceleration and pulling you around to the front of the building. When you reach the main entrance, the momentum slows, and the scene becomes more peaceful. The faceted concrete box of the lobby pushes out toward the sidewalk as if to invite you inside.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The anticipation builds once again as you move toward the building's central courtyard, a dreamy cylindrical space that is dominated by a grand staircase. A ring of sheet-metal fins climb the full height of the space, accentuating its vertical thrust, and your eye intuitively follows them up past several rows of balconies to a perfect circle of California sky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sense of compression brings to mind the ''social condensers'' created by Soviet avant-garde architects in the 1920s, communal spaces designed as a means of breaking down bourgeois individualism. But the courtyard has more to do with psychological healing than with utopianism. It is an inner sanctuary meant to nurture a sense of security -- not mass conformity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To keep this feeling from becoming too suffocating, Mr. Maltzan makes a series of bold cuts through other parts of the building, creating surprising visual connections to the world outside. A counter in the communal kitchen, for example, lines up with a slot that runs diagonally through the entire ground floor, framing views of the freeway's underbelly on one end and back toward Skid Row on the other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most unexpected of these views is in the laundry and community room on the third floor. Conceived as the building's domestic heart, the room overlooks a section of the elevated freeway through a long horizontal window. The window is made of acoustical glass, so that even at midday the noise is reduced to a soft hum. But it is so close to the passing cars that at rush hour, when traffic is barely moving, tenants and drivers can make direct and prolonged eye contact. Late at night, when the freeway is nearly empty, the cars flow by in a dreamy rhythm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a witty, even poetic moment, one that captures the dueling essences of Los Angeles: the promise of freedom and opportunity embodied by its freeways and the degree to which that promise has turned out to be a fantasy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Maltzan's housing experiments also suggest another way of thinking about the city. For much of the 20th century many architects vehemently believed in the world-changing power of their art. The age of mass production would create light-filled environments, sweeping away the squalor of urban slums. A profession that had traditionally served an aristocratic elite would now raise up the masses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That dream, of course, collapsed decades ago, a victim of corrupting political and economic forces, mediocre talents and its own ideological rigidity. In its final days it was reduced to a few dehumanizing formulas for generic housing blocks and office towers. A generation of architects never recovered from the trauma.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like others who were raised in the postmodern era, Mr. Maltzan is not directly invested in that history. Nor is he interested in coming up with a new ideological formula. His idea of progress is incremental -- the kind that can be tested through careful observation of everyday experiences. His aim has been to find a rhythm that accounts for the often conflicting needs of the human condition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Carver Apartments are the next step in this quest. The building not only manages to provide a feeling of security while easing the crippling sense of isolation that can often afflict the homeless; it also makes visible, through its strong architectural form, a group of people that many in our society would often prefer to ignore.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After last week's blizzard, neighbors helped neighbors dig out their snowbound cars. An icy wind blew off Long Island Sound, snapping American flags and jangling wind chimes that hung from squat bungalows. Posters stapled to lampposts told of St. Patrick's Day bingo games at the firehouse and a ''pot o'gold'' party for the children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The communities of Edgewater Park and Silver Beach Gardens felt as they always do, frozen in time. Manhattan, which sits just eight miles to the southwest, could not have seemed farther away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But trouble has come to these two Bronx neighborhoods, tucked on spits of land near the foot of the Throgs Neck Bridge. This month the communities, along with a real estate agent, were accused in a federal lawsuit of using racial discrimination to keep black families out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both communities are cooperatives, where residents own homes on land that is owned collectively, and where buyers must be approved by the co-ops' boards. The lawsuit, filed by an advocacy group, the Fair Housing Justice Center, said the co-ops' requirement that buyers procure three recommendation letters from current residents, who are overwhelmingly white, had a discriminatory effect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lawsuit also said that the agent, Amelia Lewis, refused to help a black couple find homes in either Edgewater Park or Silver Beach Gardens last fall, and that she told the couple the communities were prejudiced, ''like Archie Bunker territory.'' The complaint said Ms. Lewis, who runs a real estate agency outside the communities, treated a white couple far more favorably, showing them six homes and offering to line up reference letters for them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couples were ''testers,'' actors working for the advocacy group, a popular tactic of fair housing groups around the country. Calls for comment made to the offices of both co-op boards, to their lawyers and to Ms. Lewis, were not returned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a number of those who live there bridled at the accusations and said they were being unfairly blamed for the behavior attributed in the lawsuit to Ms. Lewis. ''It's baloney,'' opined Steve Warkenthien, a 37-year-old bus driver and lifelong Edgewater Park resident.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sure, some conceded, Edgewater Park and Silver Beach Gardens were mostly white, but more Asians and Latinos had moved there in recent years. Yes, the three-letter requirement was stringent, but how was that different from exclusive Manhattan co-ops? Besides, their boards had turned down white people, among them one of Mr. Warkenthien's aunts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Vacca, a city councilman who has lived in Silver Beach Gardens for 22 years, said he knew people ''of all religions and races'' living in both communities, and was deeply disturbed by what Ms. Lewis was accused of saying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If those remarks are correct, they're abhorrent,'' Mr. Vacca said. ''They're definitely not representative of the people I know, both inside or outside the community.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Edgewater Park and Silver Beach Gardens grew out of summer waterfront bungalow colonies created in the early 1900s. As the century wore on, most of the homes were winterized, or razed and replaced with year-round houses. The soaring crime rates and urban disintegration that ravaged other parts of the Bronx in the 1970s nurtured a sense that the communities were havens, but also fostered a bunker mentality of sorts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The communities, which have a total of about 1,100 homes, are all but hidden from view, with most of the streets sealed off from the surrounding neighborhoods. The bungalows remain largely affordable by New York City standards, with some still selling for $250,000 or less. Many locals are city workers: firemen, police officers, bus drivers and sanitation, utility, and postal workers who were raised there and stayed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you don't know people here, you ain't getting in, I don't care if you're the president,'' Jim Tibbatts, a retired construction worker, said as he shoveled snow at his Edgewater Park home the other day, with days-old whiskers, a blue balaclava and canary-yellow boots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet according to the lawsuit, when the white test couple visited the Silver Beach Gardens' business office, they mentioned the fact that Ms. Lewis had offered to line up reference letters even though they did not know any residents. In response, the suit said, one office worker told the couple, ''Don't tell me,'' adding, ''You need the three letters, but what I don't know can't hurt me.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joseph Post, a retired postal worker who lives in a forest-green bungalow near Edgewater Park's lone deli, said that a real estate agent helped him line up a reference letter when he bought his home 34 years ago. He said that more Spanish-speaking families had been moving in over the last 15 years, but that the place still hewed closely to its Irish, Italian and German roots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Historically, it's been a white community, and people usually sell to someone they know,'' he said. ''Sales to outsiders I don't think are too common.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed many residents, while denying there was discrimination, said they liked the exacting nature of their co-op boards. ''That's what keeps it nice,'' said Richard Ardisson, a 30-year-old firefighter who lives in the Silver Beach Gardens home he grew up in. ''Everybody's got a good job. No one wants garbage in here.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But one lifelong Edgewater Park resident, interviewed in the neighborhood's main parking lot, who would not give his name for fear of community hostility, said there was a reason the area had long been mostly white. It boiled down, he said, to property values. ''It stayed this way for so long because we kept it that way,'' he said. ''If a black guy moved next door, and I wanted to sell my house, the person may not want to buy it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Echoing a refrain almost as old as the real estate industry, the man said that even if a ''rich black person'' moved in, ''Someone would figure, 'There goes the neighborhood.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Diane L. Houk, a lawyer representing the Fair Housing Justice Center, dismissed this perception as ''a long-held, but hopefully more and more outdated way of thinking,'' and also inaccurate: Restricting demand, she said, depresses values. ''Houses stay on the market longer, the supply is larger and they're not getting the full flow of buyers who could be bidding,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the lawsuit has heightened a fear in some homeowners that the floodgates might open and just about anyone would be able to get in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If they take this away from us,'' said another resident, who also refused to give his name out of concern of community retribution, ''where else is there to go?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHOTOS: The homeowners' co-ops in Edgewater Park, above, and Silver Beach Gardens have been accused of discriminating against blacks.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EVEN a cursory glance at recent events in commercial real estate would make you think the next big collapse is upon us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, there was the default last month by Tishman Speyer Properties and BlackRock Realty on billions of dollars in loans on Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village, the huge apartment complexes in Manhattan. When the deal was done, in 2006, it was the biggest of its kind in American history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And this week, Simon Properties tried to buy <span class="companylink">General Growth Properties</span>, its shopping mall rival, for $10 billion, a price General Growth says is too low even though the company is in bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet in the midst of this, financial advisers are telling their wealthy clients that there is tremendous opportunity in real estate. What is equally intriguing is that these investors are looking again at something as illiquid as a building, which goes to show just how quickly people can reacquire their appetite for risk if it means higher returns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The trick with investing in commercial real estate is not knowing if something is bad, but knowing if that 'bad' is priced in,'' said David Frame, global head of alternative investments at J.P. Morgan Private Bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next few years are expected to be bad for commercial real estate largely because the rosy predictions made when the buildings were purchased in 2005 and 2006 have not come true. First, the values of those buildings have plummeted, as much as 45 percent in some instances. That is going to make it difficult for the owners to refinance their mortgages over the next few years. Second, the recession has reduced the rents and occupancy rates on which those inflated values were based.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what's bad for an owner may be good for an investor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STATE OF PLAY The opportunities in commercial real estate run the gamut of risk, from buying undeveloped land to buying stock in real estate investment trusts, or REITs, which invest in property and mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike Ryan, head of wealth management research for the Americas at <span class="companylink">UBS</span> Wealth Management, said while there were risks in commercial real estate, they would not be as bad as many bearish analysts had predicted and certainly not on the level of the residential real estate crash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The notion that the other shoe is about to drop and we'll see a wholesale liquidation of property is overdone,'' he said. But, he added, ''We're not saying people should plow in.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet Mr. Frame said he saw the coming refinancing crisis in commercial real estate as a continuum of what has been happening with other securities in the last 18 months. ''Our job has been to look through the capital markets and identify where there's been a scarcity of capital,'' he said, meaning where investors sold their positions quickly and fearfully. The first opportunities to take advantage of a turnaround were with convertible bonds and private equity. ''Now,'' Mr. Frame said, ''we think the opportunity in real estate is much broader than it was 12 months ago.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OPTIONS So how are people seeking to profit in commercial real estate? This depends on whether they are passive investors, who want to allocate some money to real estate, or entrepreneurs seeking to buy buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many investors who did not make their fortunes in real estate remain cautious. ''You have to help them view real estate as private equity because you're locking up your money for some period of time,'' said Joanne Jensen, a private banker at <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> Private Wealth Management.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if they're going to invest in real estate, they want the security of high-quality investments. ''I'm speaking to a lot of real estate investors, and what they've been telling me is there's been a bifurcation between the 'A' quality buildings and everything else,'' Ms. Jensen said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One intriguing strategy is to buy the underlying mortgage debt of buildings whose value was inflated. The debt is now trading at a deep discount. This may sound risky, particularly if the owner walks away from that debt, as happened with Stuyvesant Town. But Mr. Frame sees it as a way to make either a little or a lot of money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He described one possibility: a building was purchased for $100 million in 2006. It is now worth less, but the underlying mortgage is still $50 million, and it is coming due next year. The owner is probably going to have a tough time refinancing the mortgage without putting in more money. That uncertainty is reflected in the price of the debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Say it's 70 cents on the dollar, or $40 million for the first-lien mortgage,'' he said. ''If, in the next year, I get paid off, I get a 12 percent return. If not, I own the building at 60 percent off the original purchase price.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many cases, he said, clients are hoping they do not get paid back because the return from owning the building could be far greater. But the risk is they may have to hold that property for at least several years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of his other ideas carry the same caveat: they require time. In this category, he included buying land prepared for developments that have stalled or buying loans from the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>. The agency acquired these from banks and has bundled them into packages to be sold off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hotels are one area in which the investment turnaround could come faster. Their occupancy rates plummeted in the recession, and many were further hurt by having too much debt. ''The most upside can come from hotels, if we get an uptick in the economy,'' Mr. Frame said. ''But the risk is high.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, he said he believed that all these seemingly risky investments were actually predicated on caution. ''We're not taking an optimistic view of the recovery,'' he said. ''As long as it doesn't get dramatically worse, we'll be O.K.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REIT stocks are a more liquid alternative. They went through their own steep decline last year. In March 2009, REIT stocks were down 75 percent from their February 2007 high, according to the leading REIT index. The index had rebounded to half of its peak, but REIT stocks slid again after the Federal Reserve raised its lending rate to banks on Thursday. This is not necessarily a bad thing for long-term investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We think REITs are trading roughly at the net-asset value'' of the properties they own, said Thomas N. Bohjalian, a portfolio manager at Cohen &amp;Steers, a real estate investment firm. ''And that is not the ceiling; it's the floor.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is more significant than stock price, he said, is Cohen &amp;Steers's prediction that dividends on REIT stocks will grow by an average of 12 percent over each of the next five years. REITs are legally required to pay out 90 percent of their taxable income annually. In flush times, they were paying out a good portion of their cash flow as well. As income from REIT-owned properties rebounds, so will the dividends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAUTION All these investment ideas are predicated upon patience and a healthy stomach for risk. With REITs, for example, Mr. Bohjalian said he did not expect double-digit dividend growth to start until 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This patience works two ways. Ms. Jensen has several clients who have made their fortunes in real estate but have struggled to find properties at the discounts they expected. ''They're not willing to do a deal that doesn't make sense,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That may be a good mantra for any investor.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article and a picture caption in some editions last Friday about sluggish sales at some developments participating in the city's affordable-housing program misidentified the location of Waters Edge at Arverne, a project in Queens that is offering free 42-inch, flat-screen television sets to lure condominium buyers. It is in Arverne, not Far Rockaway. (Both communities are part of the Rockaways.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Fri Feb 26 2010</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all the booms and busts he has lived through, Vincent Riso never thought it would come to this: Offering free 42-inch, flat-screen televisions to lure buyers into government-subsidized homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Historically, such homes have sold quickly. But not at Waters Edge at Arverne, a stretch of 130 town house condominiums Mr. Riso's company, the Briarwood Organization, built between Far Rockaway's boardwalk and the A train's rust-streaked overpass in Queens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So last spring, Briarwood, which got $12.8 million in city and state subsidies for Waters Edge, began throwing in as much as seven months' free maintenance on some units, along with the TV. Still, as of mid-February, roughly three years after the units began arriving on the market, 22 of them had yet to sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city has received accolades nationwide for its efforts to provide housing affordable to middle- and lower-income households. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has pledged to build, save or restore 165,000 such housing units by 2014. But while the city is still filling up low-income rentals, the housing program is struggling on the ownership front.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales are sluggish at some projects, particularly ones in poorer neighborhoods aimed at middle-income buyers. Few units will be built any time soon: since July 2008, the city has made only two deals with developers for new home ownership projects, down from two dozen deals in the 12 months before that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last summer, Mr. Bloomberg and the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, unveiled the city's Housing Asset Renewal Program, or HARP, setting aside $20 million for developers who agreed to drop the prices of unsold market-rate condos. But the program drew far fewer applications than the city had expected -- just five by the Dec. 31 cutoff -- so the deadline was extended.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City housing officials and developers said the reasons for the slowdown were clear. Financing for new buildings has dried up. The HARP program has yet to catch on because developers and lenders were unwilling to cut into profits they were expecting to make. Would-be homebuyers remained hesitant to make the leap, and, crucially, mortgages were harder to get.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers of higher-priced affordable housing were especially hurt by the housing crash, which caused price differences between their units and market-rate homes to narrow. In addition, market-rate homes do not have the resale restrictions that the affordable homes often have.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rafael E. Cestero, the city's housing commissioner, said that during the housing boom, when financing for many projects was lined up, higher-priced units like those at Waters Edge ''were deeply affordable'' compared with what was then on the market. ''We had no idea what was going to happen,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Denise Scott, managing director for New York's Local Initiatives Support Corporation, said her agency's nonprofit partners were struggling to sell 95 refurbished houses and condos in Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn, Jamaica in Queens, and Morrisania in the Bronx, all city subsidized and costing $250,000 to $350,000. Some have been sitting on the market for 18 months, she said, even though their prices were cut from 15 percent to 30 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Scott said that demand was down but that the biggest impediment was banks' unwillingness to issue mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Samuel G. Gaccione, executive vice president for the TNS Development Group, said his group planned upgrades at the Shelton, a subsidized building under construction in Bedford-Stuyvesant -- granite countertops, stainless-steel appliances, hardwood floors -- to prepare for a bad market and buyer trepidation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the fact that some homes are standing vacant in struggling neighborhoods has caused some to question the wisdom of putting them there in the first place. Waters Edge occupies the highest strata of what the city defined as affordable: Three-bedroom units are going for up to $344,000 in a neighborhood where the median income is $45,221, according to census data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Javier Valdes, deputy director of the community advocacy group Make the Road New York, based in Bushwick, Brooklyn, said the city should change how it calculated affordable income limits. Generally, people eligible for low-income subsidized units can earn up to 80 percent of what is known as the region's ''area median income,'' which in 2009 was $76,800. Moderate-income housing is open to people earning from 80 percent to 120 percent, and middle-income housing is open to people earning 120 percent to 175 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But those income figures are based on a broad region that includes Long Island and Putnam, Rockland and Westchester Counties. Mr. Valdes said affordability should be determined by neighborhood. In Bushwick, the median income is $32,328, according to census figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We understand the difficulty and the balancing act the city has to play, to provide affordable housing to middle and lower income,'' Mr. Valdes said. ''But if condos are sitting unsold, we do want them given to people who are from the community.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cestero, the housing commissioner, said the city had long worked to create economically diverse neighborhoods and could not have anticipated the housing bust. He said only a few hundred homes remained unsold and noted that the foreclosure rate among city-subsidized homes was just 0.06 percent. ''I don't look back and think our strategy was wrong,'' he said. ''I think our strategy was exactly right.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some projects are doing well, especially lower-priced ones. At the Solara, which Briarwood put up in the South Bronx, 151 of the 160 units are under contract, after a year and a half on the market. Prices there range from $108,815 for a one-bedroom apartment to $202,217 for a three-bedroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seeing this trend, one development switched midstream. The Atlantic Terrace, an 80-unit building in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, built by the Fifth Avenue Committee, a community development group, was originally going to sell 59 units to families earning up to 165 percent of the area median income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the market collapsed, the group lined up an additional $2 million in subsidies to make the homes affordable to people earning far less. The lottery for the units drew 4,881 applicants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We read the tea leaves,'' said Michelle de la Uz, the group's executive director.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the troubles, the city said that it was nearing the 100,000 mark in the number of affordable units created or preserved and that it was having little difficulty creating and filling rentals, which tend to be aimed at lower-income families and constitute two-thirds of the total.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the market, Mr. Cestero said, the city plans to concentrate on preservation and building mixed-income rentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Far Rockaway, Mr. Riso said he was almost certain that the last 22 condos at Waters Edge would sell by summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a recent day, with an Arctic wind whipping off the Atlantic, a rare sight came into view: a new buyer. Ronald Fields, 46, his wife, Naomi, and their 4-year-old son, Taiga, dropped by to see the three-bedroom home they were expecting to close on this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fields, who works at the cable channel truTV, could not quite believe he was about to become a homeowner, after saving for a down payment for many years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Two blocks from the beach, a new development, you can't beat it!'' Mr. Fields said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, he added, he was looking forward to that free TV.</p>

</div><div class="author">By CHARLES V. BAGLI </div><div>997 words</div><div>17 February 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>21</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than two years ago, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the city concluded that there was enough money for only one new station on the extension of the No. 7 line, at 34th Street and 11th Avenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plans for a second station, at 10th Avenue and 41st Street, were shelved. But now that the tunnel boring machines have chewed through 10 blocks, the real estate industry wants the second station built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fresh off a victorious effort to persuade the federal government to move the Khalid Shaikh Mohammed trial from New York City, the Real Estate Board of New York, the powerful lobbying arm of the industry, has turned its attention to the missing link in the No. 7 line. This week it started a Web site (BuildTheStation.com), a petition drive and a lobbying campaign to press the Obama administration to come up with hundreds of millions of dollars to pay for the station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We think it should have two stops,'' said Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board. ''There is substantial growth already taking place near 10th and 41st. For them to quietly let the station evaporate, without anyone telling anybody, is a mistake.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The station's status is not exactly news, however. City and transit authority officials say that the station was eliminated from the plans more than two years ago, and it was not a secret. There were newspaper articles and protests by elected officials, including Senator Charles E. Schumer and Representative Jerrold Nadler. The city and the authority did retain an ''option'' with its construction contractor to build the second station, but that expired in September 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, the plan is to continue to cut a tunnel from 34th and 11th to the current No. 7 terminus at Times Square. The tunnel will pass by 41st and 10th, where the second station was to be built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The subway extension, scheduled to be finished at the end of 2013, is a major element of the Bloomberg administration's signature project: turning the West Side into the city's newest residential and commercial district. Promoters said the subway would bring public transit to the windswept neighborhood and ignite high-rise development where warehouses, factories and parking lots once stood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Spinola said developers like Joseph Moinian and Larry Silverstein and tenants in some of the new towers on 42nd Street had long understood that the station would be built. The board, in fact, is so eager to see plans for it resurrected in these financially trying times that it says local landlords may be willing to provide some cash, say $50 million of the $800 million cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was hard to believe that tunnel would go right through the station but there'd be no station,'' said Mary Ann Tighe, chairwoman of the Real Estate Board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Tighe said the station was a perfect shovel-ready project for federal money earmarked for infrastructure projects. She is working with Mr. Schumer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, Mr. Schumer said, ''Everyone involved should jump at the opportunity to create a second stop at 41st and 10th, which would open a portion of Manhattan that is ripe for development.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But not all landlords are up in arms about the omission. Unlike commercial developers, residential developers on the West Side have long said the subway extension was a good idea but not critical to their success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It helps residential guys,'' said Tom Elghanayan, chairman of TF Cornerstone. ''But if it's not built, it'd be fatal for commercial development. That means no office development in that part of town.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cornerstone recently completed and leased a building with 395 apartments on the east side of 10th Avenue, between 37th and 38th Streets. It is now finishing a two-tower building on the west side of the avenue with 865 apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second station would be on land at 41st Street and 10th Avenue where Related Companies is erecting a large residential tower. ''I'm not slowing my building down for it,'' said Related's chief executive, Stephen M. Ross. ''We were told there's no money around at all. God knows, the M.T.A. doesn't have any money.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other station, at 34th and 11th Avenue, is key to another proposed Related project: a $15 billion development of office towers, residential buildings and parks over the railyards between 30th and 33rd Streets, from 10th to 12th Avenues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The No. 7 subway line extension has been one long compromise since 2002. Originally, the Bloomberg administration wanted to extend the line from Times Square west and south to 34th Street, before turning east to run into Pennsylvania Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the estimated cost of the two-block-long link to Penn Station, which required drilling underneath existing rail lines, was prohibitive at $1 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The extension was never a priority for the transportation authority, which builds, operates and maintains the city's subways and commuter rail operations. To avoid a battle with proponents of the long planned Second Avenue subway, the Bloomberg administration offered to pay for the No. 7 line extension.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But by 2006, the administration, in an effort to pare costs, said it would carve out the cavern and platforms for the second station but indefinitely delay building the station. In late 2007, the city and the authority scuttled the station project altogether.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A 10th Avenue station might sound nice,'' said Andrew Brent, a spokesman for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, ''but the M.T.A. and state budget problems are well known, and the city is in no position to step in to pay for that, too.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">South of 42nd Street in Manhattan, the bright lights of Broadway start to fade and give way to the trimmings shops, fabric stores and designers' ateliers of the garment district. But in recent years, much of the clothing trade has moved overseas, leaving vacant factory spaces that have lured growing numbers of theater and arts groups to the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the garment district isn't quite ''South Broadway,'' real estate experts said it had become a logical choice for smaller organizations. Bounded by Fifth and Ninth Avenues from 34th to 42nd Streets, the area is a collection of smaller buildings with old tenements scattered among them, where rents have remained among the cheapest of any central business district in Manhattan, averaging $45 a square foot on avenues and $30 on side streets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Times Square area, which is full of new Class A office space, has an average asking rent of just under $70 a square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are lots of spaces, particularly on side streets, that are loftlike, large, clean and very affordable -- great opportunities for arts organizations, many of them nonprofits,'' said Robin Abrams, an executive vice president at the Lansco Corporation, a commercial brokerage. ''It's centrally located and relatively close to the theater district, so that's been the appeal.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joining small theaters like the National Comedy Theater at 347 West 36th Street and the New Perspectives Theater Company at 456 West 37th Street are larger performing arts groups and theater service organizations priced out of Times Square and other parts of Manhattan. In December, the Pearl Theater Company moved to a 4,300-square-foot office at 307 West 38th street near Eighth Avenue, from the East Village.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you walk through the area, it sort of looks like an arts district developing,'' said Shira Beckerman, managing director of the Pearl. ''In terms of the Off Broadway community, it feels as if there's as many organizations in the garment district as there are right up in the Times Square area.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Beckerman said the cheaper space had enabled the Pearl to house its administration, rehearsal studio and costume shop under one roof and near its performance space on West 55th Street. Two other theater groups have offices in her building: Primary Stages and the LAByrinth Theater Company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another newcomer is the Theater Development Fund, which, after decades in the Paramount Building at 1501 Broadway, was priced out of Times Square. In May 2009, the fund moved into 9,000 square feet at 520 Eighth Avenue between 36th and 37th Streets, still close to its TKTS booth in Times Square.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Small theaters in New York have always gone where there are spaces they can afford,'' said Victoria Bailey, the fund's executive director. ''The small theaters go first, then the larger theaters or the larger service organizations follow. What's happened is you've reached a bit more of a critical mass here.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Baryshnikov Arts Center recently opened a new venue on the western fringe of the garment district. In 2005, the arts center bought the top floors of a six-story building on 37th Street between Ninth and 10th Avenues. Called 37 Arts, the building was developed by a group that included the Broadway producers Kevin McCollum and Jeffrey Seller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Baryshnikov used its floors as offices and studio space, while the lower levels of 37 Arts were three small theaters rented by performance groups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though successful musicals like ''In the Heights'' and ''Fela!'' appeared there before moving to Broadway, 37 Arts struggled, and in 2007 the Baryshnikov bought one of its theaters for $4.5 million. After spending $8.5 million to overhaul the space, the arts center opened it as the Jerome Robbins Theater on Feb. 16 with the Wooster Group as its resident company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May 2008, the Orchestra of St. Luke's bought the rest of the 37 Arts building, including the two remaining theaters. The orchestra has announced plans to create the DiMenna Center for Classical Music, which will be more than 20,000 square feet and provide a home for the orchestra along with rehearsal halls, studios and other amenities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked about the garment district as a location for performing arts, Stanford Makishi, executive director of the Baryshnikov Arts Center, said, ''It's gratifying that others have followed us here, because it suddenly feels like we made a really smart choice.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are really huge residential towers sprouting up all around us, and with that will come potential audience members,'' he added, referring to new high-rises that will bring more than 2,300 apartments just north and west of the garment district.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet that residential development, and its associated amenities, also means that rising rents could eventually drive out smaller theaters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Even though the space here is more affordable than other places, the performance spaces, particularly those on the ground floor, are competing against retail uses, so it's difficult for the smaller theater groups to make a go,'' said Jonathan Denham, a principal with Denham Wolf Real Estate Services, a commercial real estate firm specializing in nonprofits that has consulted with many arts organizations in the garment district.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David M. Pincus, chairman of the theater task force for Community Board 4, which represents the garment district, is also managing director of the WorkShop Theater Company. He said his theater and two others in the same building, at 312 West 36th Street near Eighth Avenue, were struggling to pay their rents, which had tripled over the last decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While theaters and arts organizations have been promoting the area as an arts district with a festival each October for the last five years, that may not be enough. Mr. Pincus is pushing a Manhattan-wide property tax abatement for landlords who lease to performing arts tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has also led an initiative to include 16,000 square feet of space for small theaters in the West Side railyards project, from 28th to 42nd Streets, which includes a western sliver of the garment district.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Still, that's 10 or more years down the line,'' Mr. Pincus said, ''and many theaters are on the chopping block right now.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ELKHART, Ind. -- Over the next six months, the federal government plans to wind down many of its emergency programs for housing. Then it will become clear if the market can function on its own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People here are pretty sure the answer will be no.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Obama has traveled twice to this beleaguered manufacturing city to spotlight the government's economic stimulus program. The employment picture here has indeed begun to improve over the last nine months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Elkhart also symbolizes the failure of federal efforts to turn around the housing slump at the heart of the economic crisis. Housing in this community has become almost entirely dependent on a string of federal support programs, which are nonetheless failing to prevent a fall in prices and a rise in mortgage delinquencies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than one in 10 mortgage holders in Elkhart is seriously behind on payments. The median sales price has plunged to the level of a decade ago. Many homeowners owe more than their home is worth, freezing them in place for years. Foreclosures recently hit a record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To the extent that the real estate market is functioning at all, people here say, it is doing so only because of the emergency programs, which have pushed down interest rates on mortgages and offered buyers a substantial tax credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Equally important is an expanded mortgage insurance program run by the Federal Housing Administration, which encourages private lenders to accept borrowers with small down payments. The government takes the risk of default.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few years ago, only one in 10 buyers in Elkhart used the housing agency program. Now about half do. Across the country, the agency has greatly expanded its reach so that it now insures six million mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There has been all kinds of help for housing. I'm not unappreciative,'' said Barb Swartley, president of the Elkhart County Board of Realtors. ''But you can't turn real estate into a government-sponsored operation forever.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many in Washington agree. With worries about the deficit intensifying, the government is eager to start withdrawing some of its support programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first step could happen as early as next month, when the Federal Reserve has said it will end its trillion-dollar program to buy up mortgage securities. That program has driven mortgage interest rates to lows not seen since the 1950s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet it is uncertain whether the government can really pull back without sending housing markets into another tailspin. ''A rise in rates would kill us all by itself,'' Ms. Swartley said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama administration has offered few ideas about reforming the housing market. Proposals for the future of <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, the mortgage holding companies taken over by the government at the height of the crisis, were supposed to be introduced with the president's budget this month. They were not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government programs, however crucial, are distorting the market. The tax credit produced sales last fall, but some lenders here say it has troubling implications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People are buying to get that tax credit, to get some reserve money. They're saying, 'If something happens, I will have a little bit of money to fall back on,' '' said Denny Davis of Horizon Bank in Elkhart. ''That's not healthy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The programs favor first-time buyers, who have the fewest resources to bring to a deal. Heather Stevens, a 23-year-old nurse here, is closing on a three-bedroom house this week. Since her loan was insured by the Federal Housing Administration, she had to put down only 3.5 percent of the $74,900 purchase price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was a breeze to get approved,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sellers are covering her closing costs, which agents say is often the case here. That meant Ms. Stevens had to come up with only the $2,600 down payment, which still took all her savings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the best part is the $7,500 tax credit. She will use that to remodel the kitchen. ''If it wasn't for the credit, we would have waited to buy,'' said Ms. Stevens, who is getting married this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buying houses with no money down was a feature of the latter stages of the housing bubble. It gave prices a final push into the stratosphere. But buyers with no equity were the first to abandon their properties as the market turned south.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With housing prices stagnant, bolstering the market by again letting people buy with hardly any money down is viewed in some quarters as a bad bet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neil Barofsky, the special inspector general for the government's Troubled Asset Relief Program, wrote in his most recent report to Congress that ''the federal government's concerted efforts to support'' housing prices ''risk reinflating'' the bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He noted one difference from the last bubble: taxpayers, rather than banks, are now directly at risk in these new mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Elkhart, the worries are less about the risks of doing too much and more about the perils of doing too little. If the Federal Reserve really ends its $1.25 trillion program of buying mortgage-backed securities, economists say, mortgage rates could rise as much as one percentage point. In recent weeks, rates on 30-year fixed mortgages have drifted below 5 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax credit requires home buyers to make a deal by April 30, the middle of the prime spring selling season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, the F.H.A. is modestly tightening the requirements on some of its programs, trying to strike a balance between stabilizing the market with qualified buyers and overwhelming it with unqualified borrowers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Katalinich, chief lending officer at the Inova Federal Credit Union in Elkhart, says there is danger in letting buyers get into properties with so little at stake, but those risks are minimal compared to the alternative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If the government were not to continue the same level of support, it would be very detrimental, like cutting the legs off a wobbling child and expecting it to run a marathon,'' he said. ''It's very possible we'll still be at this level of need five years from now.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elkhart, in the northeast corner of Indiana, became a symbol of distressed Middle America after Mr. Obama chose it as the place to introduce his stimulus plan last February. The region is a hub of recreational vehicle manufacturing, one of the first industries to falter in the recession. In less than a year, the unemployment rate tripled, peaking at 18.9 percent last March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama returned in August to promote the effectiveness of the stimulus program and of government grants for the manufacture of battery-powered electric vehicles. Several companies have announced they are hiring. Unemployment in December was down to 14.8 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No such improvement is visible with housing. In the last 18 months, the F.H.A increased its loans in Elkhart by 40 percent even as its defaults rose 174 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As these troubled loans become foreclosures, the government takes over the property and tries to sell it. On Saturday, Gina Martin, an administrative assistant, examined a three-bedroom government house for sale southeast of Elkhart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late 2003, the house sold for $115,000, but in these depressed times the government was willing to let it go for $75,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Martin's agent, Dean Slabach, thought the government would eventually have to take a much lower bid, substantially increasing its loss. Most of the F.H.A. properties on the market in Elkhart carry notations like ''significant price reduction'' and ''all reasonable offers considered.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They'll end up selling this for $60,000 or less,'' Mr. Slabach said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ms. Martin, a 47-year-old renter who has approval for an F.H.A. loan, said she was not tempted at any price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We'll see what else is out there,'' she said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week offered some sobering news on the housing market: Even with broad government support for housing, data from the National Association of Realtors showed that the median price of single-family homes continued to decline in 2009. RealtyTrac, an online marketer of foreclosed properties, said foreclosure filings rose by 15 percent in January compared with a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreclosure is generally a long process, with multiple filings as delinquent borrowers fall ever further behind. What is most ominous about the latest RealtyTrac numbers is that nearly 88,000 people had their homes repossessed in January, a 31 percent increase from a year ago. The big jump indicates that many foreclosures that were in process in 2009 are now beginning to move to repossession and, eventually, auction. With more than four million homes in that pipeline, the foreclosure crisis shows no sign of abating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Worse, as The Times's Peter Goodman recently reported, the Obama administration's antiforeclosure plan (which pays cash incentives to mortgage companies that lower monthly payments for troubled borrowers) may be doing more harm than good for some borrowers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before a lender will permanently modify a loan under the plan, eligible borrowers must go through a trial period -- several months in which they keep current on reduced monthly payments. For some borrowers, even a reduced payment is too onerous, leading to redefault. Others reported being denied a permanent modification even after keeping up the trial payments. In both cases, the borrowers do not avoid foreclosure, and are out the money they have paid during the trial period. That is money they could have spent moving to a rental home or for other purposes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is an emerging consensus among financial experts and policy makers that the key to successful modifications is to reduce the amount of the borrower's loan balance, rather than merely reducing the monthly payment. The goal is to lower the payment while restoring equity, thus giving borrowers both the means and the incentive to keep up with their payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Administration officials have resisted that approach, in part because they believe it would be too expensive. Another obstacle is the lenders themselves. In general, a lender is unwilling to take losses by reducing principal unless the owners of the second mortgage on a home also take a hit. For banks that own the second mortgages, such losses would be huge -- something they clearly would prefer not to face up to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks' unwillingness to take losses on second mortgages may also be holding up so-called short sales, in which a lender agrees to retire a first-mortgage debt by taking the proceeds from the sale of the home, even when the amount is less than the mortgage balance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last April, the Treasury detailed a plan to get second-mortgage owners to write down their debt once the first mortgage is modified. But until recently, when <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> signed on, no banks had cooperated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unless the banks can be compelled to get on board -- allowing principal reductions to become the norm -- the antiforeclosure effort may have more success in letting banks postpone their losses than in helping Americans keep their homes.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE super high-end of Manhattan real estate doesn't seem to be doing all that badly, if you judge by the recent $23.98 million sale of a lavish penthouse at the Park Laurel, a 40-story condominium at 15 West 63rd Street in Lincoln Square.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seven-bedroom seven-bathroom duplex was listed at $28 million last September and went into contract within two months. It has more than 7,700 square feet of space and an additional 1,200 square feet of outdoor space. The buyers may have shaved off nearly 15 percent of the asking price, but they still wound up paying nearly $2,700 per square foot. The listing agents, Raphael and Claudine De Niro, declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sellers were Ephraim F. Gildor, a hedge fund founder, and his wife, Catherine. The Gildors live in Aspen, Colo., with their three children and apparently used the condo as a pied-a-terre. Mr. Gildor is a former fighter pilot with the Israeli Air Force and went on to found two hedge fund businesses. He and his wife established the Gildor Foundation, which contributes to programs in the sciences, arts, and education, including schools in the United States and Israel, and the Metropolitan Opera and the New York City Ballet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buyers, according to city records, were two residents of Switzerland, Peter Edward Chadney and Simone Cecile Von Graffenried Simperl.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK is one big sprawling city, full of people who are proud to call themselves New Yorkers. But sometimes it seems as if that were where the sameness ended. Just try to find a taxi on Staten Island or a gas station in Manhattan and you will quickly learn that there are big differences among the boroughs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another way to experience that diversity is to shop for a home. On your hunt, you'll find more bedrooms in the Bronx, more doormen in Manhattan, more brownstones in Brooklyn and more houses in Queens and Staten Island -- as well as a tremendous disparity in price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan remains the most expensive, but prices have fallen across the city, more than 25 percent in some neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, $500,000 will buy you a very nice home in New York City, even in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That price is ''a comfortable entry level if you want a variety of choices,'' said Diane M. Ramirez, the president of Halstead Property. ''But bear in mind, this is an active market. If you see something and you like it, you should buy it. It's not going to sit there -- if it's properly priced.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's a taste of what you can get for $500,000 in each of the five boroughs, starting with Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a small one-bedroom apartment on the market for $499,000 at 817 West End Avenue. It's on the 11th floor of a prewar doorman building and has views of the Hudson River.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's a million-dollar view, but we're not charging a million dollars for the apartment,'' said the seller's broker, Wendy Frank of Barak Realty, with a chuckle. ''That's one of my lines.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment, No. 11EE, has a reasonable common charge -- $428 including taxes -- but it's only about 550 square feet. In the fall, the owners accepted an offer of $505,000. The deal fell through because the buyer couldn't get a mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Banks are being very cautious,'' Ms. Frank said. ''That's the trouble we're running into right now. It's not the price of the apartment, it's the finances of the person and the owner-occupancy level of the building.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, apartments priced at $550,000 or less make up the fastest-moving piece of the Manhattan market. Among resale apartments that closed in the fourth quarter of 2009, those costing $550,000 or less spent the fewest days on the market, according to Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel and a partner at Condominium Recovery, which invests in real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apartments that cost less than $550,000 took an average of 145 days to sell, while those priced between $550,000 and $1 million spent 172 days on the market. For apartments between $1 million and $3 million, that number was 175 days, and for homes above the $3 million mark, the figure jumped to 199.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what else can you get in Manhattan for around $500,000?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, your choices included an 800-square-foot one-bedroom at 160 East 27th Street, a postwar building at the corner of Third Avenue. The apartment, No. 12E, is listed for $515,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was also a 1,000-square-foot co-op with two bedrooms at 100 Overlook Terrace, in the Hudson Heights section of Washington Heights. The apartment, No. 66, is owned by a sponsor, and has a renovated kitchen and sweeping views. It's listed for $529,000 with Simone Song Properties and Stein-Perry Real Estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the prices in Manhattan have fallen quite a bit in the last year, you still tend to get more for your money if you cross a bridge or two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Ditmas Park, Brooklyn, for example, Karen Talbott, a senior sales associate at <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, is selling a 1,400-square-foot three-bedroom apartment with a terrace in a doorman building at 616 East 18th Street for $489,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Brooklyn is a vast and varied place. What you get for $500,000 differs enormously from Brooklyn Heights to Greenpoint to Sheepshead Bay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Park Slope, one of Brooklyn's priciest areas, Ezra Orchard, a vice president, director of Brown Harris Stevens, is selling a floor-through of about 750 square feet at 446 Fifth Street for $535,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This apartment, on the third floor of a brownstone between Sixth and Seventh Avenues, is listed as a one-and-a-half-bedroom -- the half being only 6 by 10 feet. That is fine for a nursery, but you would have to shoehorn a teenager in there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The thinking was that we'd price it at the high end of the one-bedroom range, even though legally it's a two,'' Mr. Orchard said. ''I want people to have realistic expectations.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In nearby Prospect Heights, Marcy Feltman, an associate broker at Brown Harris Stevens, is selling a two-bedroom that is roughly the same size and about $50,000 cheaper. But the apartment, at 132 Prospect Place, is on the fifth floor of a walk-up building. Ms. Feltman says the sellers are willing to negotiate -- within reason.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, that kind of flexibility is the case more often than not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In today's real estate market, you have to leave a little room for negotiation,'' said Michael P. Carfagna, the president of MPC Properties, a brokerage in Queens. ''It's a fact of life.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Carfagna is selling a two-bedroom co-op with two bathrooms, a sunken living room and a terrace, in a building called the Terrace View in Jackson Heights. At $495,000, it is not the steal of the century -- a 1,350-square-foot three-bedroom apartment is listed for $499,000 nearby at 83-10 35th Avenue. But Mr. Carfagna's two-bedroom listing, which is about 1,250 square feet, is in a building with a doorman and a garage -- a rare combination in the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current owner is Luis Alberto Soto, a retiree and longtime New Yorker who is selling the apartment so that he can spend more time with family in Miami. He says he understands the need to negotiate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm attached to the place,'' Mr. Soto said, ''but if I get the right price, I'll sell it. They can come back at me with a counteroffer. Slightly lower,'' he added, ''but not too much.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Queens, Jackson Heights has a high concentration of co-op apartment buildings like Mr. Soto's. But throughout much of the borough, people live in houses. Many trade for well under $500,000 these days, with neighborhoods closer to Manhattan almost always commanding higher prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Long Island City, a quick subway ride from Manhattan, you'll find an abundance of new condo buildings. In Astoria, a slightly longer subway ride from Manhattan, you can opt for a small house. There is a two-story house with 750 square feet and two bedrooms at 26-12 30th Street in Astoria on the market for $489,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you have your heart set on a house, you can also look in New York's most suburban borough, Staten Island.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You can get a very nice house for $500,000,'' said Tony Whalen, a broker there at Appleseed Homes whose license plates read ''SI TONY.'' ''I sell a lot of houses between three and four.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right now, he has a 3,200-square-foot two-family house on the North Shore with a price tag of $499,000. Each unit has three bedrooms, a bathroom and a porch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 10 Duer Lane, not far from Mr. Whalen's listing, there is a single-family house with four bedrooms, two baths and an asking price of $485,000. And on the South Shore, a 2,000-square-foot four-bedroom at 78 Wirt Avenue is on the market for $519,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you take your $500,000 budget to the Bronx, you may have money to spare. Many of the borough's houses trade for well under $500,000, although the Riverdale section can set you back a whole lot more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even in Riverdale, $500,000 will get you rooms for the children and maybe even a place for the car. An early 20th-century Dutch colonial at 3628 Greystone Avenue, listed for $495,000, has three bedrooms, two bathrooms and a garage. However, it is in need of renovation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Most of my business is people who were priced out of Brooklyn, which means they were originally priced out of Manhattan,'' said Susan Lynne Seidner Chasky, a senior vice president of Halstead Property who works in Riverdale and the northwest Bronx. ''We've always been the least expensive. The Bronx doesn't have a good rep.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When you move farther south or east in the Bronx, a budget of $500,000 will often point you toward multifamily homes, like 2240 Seward Avenue in Castle Hill, on the market for just under $500,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But according to Marjo Benavides, a broker at Ariela Heilman Real Estate who sells apartments in the South Bronx around Yankee Stadium, people often come to the borough precisely because they want to spend much less. Her most expensive listing right now is a three-bedroom apartment on the Grand Concourse for $349,000.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hello Living condo project in Brooklyn was marketed as an urban utopia, a collection of low-rise apartments designed for young families without large inheritances or bonuses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than three dozen of them closed on apartments, enticed by the modern designs set among the brick walk-ups of Prospect Heights and by amenities like a pool, a gym and a children's playroom that have all become the standard in higher-priced buildings. One resident called his building a ''luxury urban kibbutz'' where residents have a baby-sitting co-op and watch ''Lost'' episodes in the screening room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first sign that something was not right came last fall, when fliers appeared outside one open house saying, ''Buyers Beware'' and ''Buying an Apartment in This Building Will Likely Get You Sued.'' Lawyers started calling people who had already made down payments to issue the same warning, and at least two people discovered that their banks had withdrawn their loan commitments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then the lawsuits arrived, and even some families who had already closed and moved in found themselves on the defense.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For most of us, this is our first purchase, and it's most of our life savings,'' said Jennifer DiFiglia, who has a contract with her husband on a $525,000 two-bedroom. Her deposit remains tied up in litigation, and if she cannot close, she could lose thousands of dollars in legal fees and tax penalties for withdrawing retirement money. ''This isn't a building filled with people working at hedge funds,'' she added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They have become collateral victims in a vicious fight that is equal parts old Brooklyn and 21st-century real estate, a battle among a 34-year-old developer, his mentor from Borough Park and a two wealthy Austrian investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The developer, Eli Karp, is being sued by the others, who accuse him of stealing money from the project and selling apartments without permission. Mr. Karp has fired back, saying that they were simply unhappy with the prices and the pace of sales, and were angry because he would not agree to let the properties fall into foreclosure so that they could buy them for ''below-market prices,'' according to an affidavit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The case has traveled from the Manhattan courts through a rabbinical court and now to the Brooklyn courts. The fight has grown so contentious that a judge, Justice Charles E. Ramos of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, reprimanded both sides, saying, ''You're constantly jumping all over each other, and you have clients that will bury their heads in the sand and let these properties go up in smoke.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The roots of the dispute go back to Borough Park, where Mr. Karp said he took a keen interest in a neighbor, the ''big shot'' businessman Solomon Obstfeld, who works at a financial advisory firm on Central Park South. He tutored Mr. Obstfeld's son and marveled at his chauffeured cars, his collection of watches worth more than $100,000 apiece and his tales about his business battles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said that Mr. Obstfeld, who is now 54, was not just a role model. ''He was my best friend,'' Mr. Karp said while seated in an overstuffed office chair in one of his completed buildings on Pacific Street. ''I looked up to him.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2004, Mr. Karp pitched his plans to turn a beleaguered block into a condo community. Mr. Obstfeld agreed to invest $5 million, Mr. Karp said. And when Mr. Karp expanded his plans, he said, Mr. Obstfeld ultimately provided $30 million to construct a collection of 10 buildings, most of them spread over three blocks in Prospect Heights. Sprinkled among the buildings would be communal amenities including a business lounge, rooms for private parties, a gym and a 50-foot-long lap pool, with residents of every building having access to all of them. (A building several blocks away has separate amenities.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the summer of 2005, Mr. Karp said, he received an e-mail message from an Austrian businessman named Leon Lewkowicz, who identified himself as a major investor and said he wanted to visit the project. That December, Mr. Karp said, he received another e-mail message, from a man named James Schlaff, who said that he also was an investor and that he wanted to visit from Austria to review the financials. Mr. Karp said that he had not known of their involvement before the e-mail messages, but that Mr. Obstfeld confirmed they were involved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Lewkowicz and Mr. Schlaff are strangers in Brooklyn, but are well known in Austria. Dr. Lewkowicz has been associated in news reports with one of that country's largest banks, though his lawyer in New York says that he has never been an employee there. Mr. Schlaff has been known as a wealthy casino owner who was investigated, along with his brother Martin Schlaff, several years ago over accusations that they had made illegal payments to the family of Ariel Sharon, then the Israeli prime minister. They have not been charged. Martin Schlaff also attracted attention in 2008 for paying one of the world's largest divorce settlements, reportedly 190 million euros.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the buildings in Brooklyn were finished -- seven have been built -- Mr. Karp started selling apartments, despite the market slowdown. Of the approximately 110 apartments that Mr. Karp planned to develop and sell, he closed on 41 and has 5 in contract. Gil Talmi, a film composer who moved into a one-bedroom at 957 Pacific Street with his wife in November 2008, praised Mr. Karp's construction and the ''luxury urban kibbutz'' that he said was filled with ''cool, hip, groovy people.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in an affidavit, Mr. Karp said that around June 2008, he started having ''material disagreements'' with his investors when ''the real estate market also began to fall into a deep recession, with prices declining precipitously, mortgage money drying up and sales becoming far more difficult to obtain and/or to close.'' He said the apartment sales prices matched their appraisals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But court records say that Mr. Karp's investors grew concerned about the project's future in late 2008 because Mr. Karp had not ''accurately projected his costs'' and ''grossly exceeded his budget.'' The investors accused Mr. Karp of ''stealing at least $170,000'' from the project and continuing to sell apartments without their consent, even though their original agreement said that he needed their approval. In July 2009, they said in court papers, they changed the operating agreements so that Mr. Karp no longer had authority to act on their behalf. Any contracts or agreements after that, they said, were done ''without the authority of the owner.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Karp replied in an affidavit that his investors wanted him to ''default on the loans and the buildings will go into foreclosure.'' That way, he said, they could buy them on the cheap. ''If this occurs,'' he said, ''not only would I be ruined as a developer as no bank, for the foreseeable future, would lend me a nickel.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Karp said in a court affidavit that in August, a beth din, or rabbinical court, ruled that he could continue to sell the apartments, with any money left over after loan payments deposited in escrow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obstfeld and the investors are pressing their case in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn. Because they claim that Mr. Karp did not have the authority to make the sales, they have named some would-be residents, and several who have moved in, as defendants in an attempt to cancel or overturn sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lisa Daniels, who has been renting in an East Harlem walk-up with her husband and two sons while she waits to close on one of Mr. Karp's apartments, said that in late December her husband received aphone call from a lawyer at Oved &amp;Oved, the firm representing Mr. Obstfeld and the investors, advising him of the litigation. She said the firm had also spoken to their mortgage broker. Although they still have a loan lined up, at least two other buyers say their banks have withdrawn their commitments because of the uncertainties caused by the litigation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obstfeld, Mr. Schlaff and Mr. Lewkowicz referred questions to the law firm. Terrence Oved, a partner at Oved &amp;Oved, declined to comment on the case because of the pending lawsuit, but said that his firm ''exhibits the highest caliber of professionalism and integrity'' in its treatment of buyers in these projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dispute is providing few answers for buyers who simply need a place to live. Some had hoped that Mr. Karp's lawyer, Alan Lebensfeld, would help to resolve the case. But on Monday morning, Mr. Lebensfeld sent a message to the buyers saying that he was no longer Mr. Karp's counsel because he had not been able to pay his legal bills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By late Monday afternoon, buyers said that they had started receiving calls from the investors' lawyers about whether they would stay in the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, some buyers still want to move in. ''This is not an investment for us,'' said Ms. Daniels, who has a contract on a $618,000 duplex. ''This is our first home as a family.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm sorry they're losing money for what they thought they would get five years ago,'' she said. ''But it doesn't mean they have to kick families out on the street.''</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Landlord to Pay $1 Million Over Treatment of Tenants</span>
</div><div class="author">By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY </div><div>637 words</div><div>12 February 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>26</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo said Thursday that he had reached a $1 million settlement with a large New York City property owner that became a lightning rod for complaints about landlords' treatment of tenants in rent-regulated apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the settlement, the landlord, Vantage Properties, must stop harassing tenants in its 9,500 apartments in Queens and Manhattan with ''baseless legal notices'' and ''frivolous housing court evictions,'' according to a statement from Mr. Cuomo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The attorney general's office, which started its investigation in the summer of 2008, found that in Vantage's search for profits, it tried to force tenants out of apartments so it could renovate them and raise rents. Last month Mr. Cuomo said he intended to sue Vantage. The settlement said that over two years Vantage filed more than 1,000 notices against tenants and took a ''significant number'' to housing court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many residents complained that they had been falsely accused of not paying rent or of living elsewhere, Mr. Cuomo said. In many cases, Vantage filed cases based on ''unreliable sources of information'' when the tenant had every legal right to live there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the $1 million, $750,000 has been earmarked for residents ''who can demonstrate that they unjustly vacated their apartments or were subject to frivolous housing court proceedings,'' the settlement says. The rest will be given to nonprofit groups that help tenants. It is unclear how much individual tenants will receive and which nonprofit groups will benefit from the ruling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Today's agreement with Vantage not only preserves the rent-regulated apartments owned by them,'' Mr. Cuomo said in the statement, ''but also sends a strong message that my office will continue to protect tenants and bring unscrupulous landlords to justice.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Executives of Vantage, which bought the properties in 2006, said they welcomed the settlement because it gave them a clearer definition of some of the boundaries in managing affordable housing, according to Orin Snyder, a lawyer for Vantage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a sector that for decades has been filled with tension and uncertainty about the rules between landlords and tenants,'' he said. ''What we have now is really an unprecedented set of guidelines, ground rules, that govern the landlord-tenant relationship, and Vantage is and has been enthusiastic.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Affordable housing advocates praised the outcome because they said it sent a warning to other landlords that bought apartments at the peak of the real estate boom and sought profits by pressuring lower-paying renters to leave and replacing them with higher-paying tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It establishes a precedent that this predatory equity model is a threat to affordable housing and is illegal when it crosses the line,'' said Robert McCreanor, director of legal services for the Catholic Migration Office. ''Unfortunately, there's a substantial percentage of affordable housing stock affected by this.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said that his group, along with other legal services groups and nonprofit agencies, represented hundreds of Vantage tenants who were subject to ''a barrage of baseless legal proceedings'' since 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He pointed to Ricardo Aguaiza, a 47-year-old Manhattan doorman who moved into his apartment building in November 1993. Mr. Aguaiza said he had no problems for 14 years. Then in June 2007, after Vantage bought the building, he started to receive notices that he had not paid his rent, even though he regularly paid with money orders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McCreanor said Mr. Aguaiza, who lives in a one-bedroom apartment with his wife and 7-year-old son, was taken to court three times in eight months on baseless lawsuits. In one case, Vantage claimed he did not live in his apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, Mr. Aguaiza welcomed the news.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I wait for this decision,'' he said. I'm very, very happy.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PRESIDENTS' DAY weekend is when New Yorkers typically take advantage of the three-day break to: a) fly somewhere warm; b) hit the slopes; or c) look at houses in the Hamptons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you answered ''c,'' you've probably already booked a weekend full of appointments to find a desperate seller ready to make a deal, or a summer rental before the best decks and pools get snapped up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So how is the Hamptons real estate market doing, a year after freezing solid?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lot better than many people expected. Sales picked up significantly in the second half of 2009, as sellers dropped their prices and buyers made more realistic -- as opposed to ''lowball'' -- offers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even though list prices have fallen from the lofty levels homeowners once hoped to get, actual sales figures have not dropped off a cliff. The median sales price of a Hamptons home was $825,000 last year, according to Miller Samuel, an appraisal company that compiles market reports for Prudential Douglas Elliman. Although that's down 15 percent from the peak of $975,000 in 2007, it's only a 3 percent decline from 2008 and roughly where prices were in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you had asked me last year at this time where the market was going, I would have said: 'Do you have a spare room? I might need to move in,' '' said Paul Brennan, regional manager for Douglas Elliman's Hamptons office. ''But disaster has not happened. We did much better in '09 than we ever would have anticipated.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Miller Samuel's data 409 homes sold in the Hamptons in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared with 145 in the first quarter, with a steady pick-up in between. The year ended with 1,124 sales, still quite a dip from the roughly 2,300 deals done annually in the Hamptons between 2000 and 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Mr. Brennan pointed out, the current figures represent contracts that were signed in the summer and fall, since there is a lag before deals close. And since the busy second half of the year reversed the typical pattern -- which usually sees a flurry of deals early in the year so buyers can settle in before summer -- he is not sure the recent burst of activity will hold up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Right now I'm not seeing the same strength in the market,'' he said. ''But rentals seem to be active, and that's a good sign.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other brokers agreed with that assessment of the rental market, saying they've been getting calls from clients interested in looking at houses in December and January, which is usually a slow time. Presidents' Day weekend typically kicks off the search for a summer home, though agents say they've even had midweek showings recently as some renters jump the gun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rick Hoffman, Corcoran's regional senior vice president for the East End, said he expected prices for summer rentals to be in the same range as last year, which was not the usual bonanza for landlords -- despite rents in the tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of dollars. Many renters could only afford a Hamptons escape for a month instead of the usual Memorial Day to Labor Day contract, and it was not uncommon for renters to ask for and sometimes get 20 percent or 30 percent discounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think landlords realize last year was a difficult season, and they're not trying to raise prices,'' Mr. Hoffman said. ''And we're advising them not to.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether prices will be as negotiable as they were last year is anyone's guess, brokers said, although the burst of early interest suggests anyone picky about decor or proximity to the ocean might want to head out to the East End soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But ''if it's just about the money, come late,'' Mr. Hoffman said. ''You might find something that no one else wanted, and the landlord may be willing to discount.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early inquiries from renters about the summer season prompted Gerry Logue aggressively to drop the price of the three-bedroom home in Sag Harbor he had been trying to sell since mid-2008. Although he had lowered the price several times, landing at $1,495,000 last fall, it wasn't until he reduced it to $1,195,000 in January that the offers started flooding in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My goal was to do a major shift to move the house,'' Mr. Logue said. ''When I dropped it, I got tons of interest with multiple offers, and then a deal happened within a week.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That deal is now in contract at a price he said he is happy with, though given that he had done a major renovation and is selling the contents too -- including the silverware and towels -- he thinks the buyers are getting a good deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a huge value for this house,'' Mr. Logue said. ''They can literally show up with their toothbrushes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That kind of turnkey property is what Louise Phanstiel and her husband were hoping to find when they were looking at houses in East Hampton last August. Retirees who live in Los Angeles, they did not want to get involved in a long-distance renovation but found most of the homes they looked at needed a lot of work -- and seemed overpriced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In my opinion nobody really seemed to price things to move and actually a lot of these homes had been on the market quite a while,'' Ms. Phanstiel said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultimately they bought a new house in Amagansett that a builder was just completing, for a price she described as fair for both parties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There were other people bidding on the house, and they were way under bidding it,'' she said. ''We met him at a good point, and he came down a bit, and we got it done.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Gicking, the couple's broker at <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span> in East Hampton, said that flexibility on both sides has been the key to putting together deals in this market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Buyers are paying a little bit more than they expected, and sellers are accepting a little less than they would like,'' Mr. Gicking said. ''Anytime someone draws a line in the sand -- whether it's a buyer or a seller -- the deal is not getting done.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said most of the deals he has completed recently have gone into contract within 10 percent of the asking price, though he pointed out that some of those homes had earlier price reductions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Jonathan J. Miller, chief executive of Miller Samuel, that is in line with the 13.5 percent listing discount his firm found in the Hamptons in the fourth quarter -- the range between the sales price and the last asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miller said he expects market activity in the Hamptons to continue at the same level through the spring, kept in check by close to 10 percent unemployment and a tight lending environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In many ways the Hamptons is outperforming expectations during the downturn,'' he said, though he does not anticipate Wall Street bankers will swoop in and heat things up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Do I think we'll see a little bump in the spring because of bonuses? Sure, that's a seasonal pattern,'' he said. ''But do I think it's going to create some sort of housing boom? No way.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MAMMOTH LAKES, Calif. -- RICHARD LANDRY'S three-level ski house is nestled into the side of a mountain in this small resort town five hours north of Los Angeles. The stone and glass home offers unimpeded vistas of the snow-dusted Sierra Nevada mountains. It is surrounded on three sides by an outdoor deck, where a fire pit also serves as sculpture; flame-shaped tongues of steel mingle with real licks of fire. Viewed from the road below at dusk, the house softly glows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anyone glimpsing the dwelling would assume it was built by someone with exquisite taste. And they would be right. But Mr. Landry had more in mind when he designed the 5,600-square-foot home as a retreat for himself, his partner, Robert Carolla, and their 9-year-old daughter, Samantha.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We knew that we would always be having lots of friends here -- kids, couples, families -- and that there would be a lot of cooking and eating,'' Mr. Landry said. So style had to work in sync with the house's primary purpose: making sure guests of all ages have a good time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Landry, 52, runs the Landry Design Group in Los Angeles and has been named, multiple times, as one of Architectural Digest magazine's 100 top architects and designers in the world. He has created residences for Rod Stewart, Sylvester Stallone and Eddie Murphy, among many other high-profile clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As his own client Mr. Landry had a vision of what he wanted and the audacity to break some rules. Upon entering the house guests first see a striking black granite bar with seven leather chairs pulled up to it. In all likelihood a plate of snacks and a bottle of red wine will soon appear on top. The bar gives way to the kitchen just behind it. By placing the bar and kitchen front and center in his design, Mr. Landry perfectly conveys how he intended life to be lived in this house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People said, 'You're crazy,' but it's the best move we made,'' said the craggy, brown-haired Mr. Landry, clad in jeans and a cobalt-blue-and-black-plaid hoodie one recent Saturday afternoon. ''The kids eat meals there. We cook together there. It's the heart of the house.'' In addition to a six-burner Wolf range and capacious farmer sink, Mr. Landry installed a half-dozen refrigerator drawers in the kitchen for soda, juice and beer, as well as fixings for appetizers and snacks. Nothing blocks a view of mountains rising 8,000-feet high, their shoulders speckled with whitebark pine and hemlock, their peaks in the clouds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hidden away in the pantry is the Sub-Zero refrigerator, and cabinets filled with kid-friendly fare like Froot Loops. The family's cook prepares many of their meals, and some guests come armed with fresh pasta and homemade sauces. Mr. Landry prefers to tend bar, although Mr. Carolla enjoys the gourmet role. ''Robert loves to make roasts or his own enchiladas from scratch,'' said Mr. Landry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A glass dining table that seats 12 flanks the kitchen on one side. A two-story great room with floor to ceiling glass walls is on the other. Cocoa-hued couches shaped like commas surround a large leather ottoman. Beyond, a pool table beckons challengers. An earth-tone palette of sage, mustard and brown colors the space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rangy Mr. Landry had skied all over the West before discovering Mammoth Lakes in 2004. The low-key charm and relaxed vibe of the resort town of about 7,000 appealed to Mr. Landry, a carpenter's son who was raised in a small farming town in Quebec. ''Mammoth reminded me of what Aspen or Vail were 15 years ago,'' he said. He spent a single Saturday looking for properties in walking distance to a slope, and with exceptional mountain views. Within a week his offer on one 17,000-square foot parcel had been accepted. The design phase took 8 months and construction another 18. The family celebrated Christmas 2006 in the completed house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They ski nearly every weekend in January, February and March, flying privately in a leased jet from their home in Malibu, 45 minutes away by air. ''It's a luxury, but we bought at a great time, and the property has appreciated tremendously, so that's how I justify it,'' said Mr. Landry, who chose to stay mum on land and construction costs. ''I can leave the office at 3 p.m. and I'm walking in the door at 4:30,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This particular weekend eight guests were visiting, including a family of five, Mr. Landry's niece and Samantha's karate teacher and her son. As they trooped in from afternoon skiing, the house came to life. In the great room Samantha and her friend Sage Lescher ensconced themselves on two leather massage chairs. Bria Lescher, 5, settled in to watch ''Ratatouille'' on the 55-inch flat-screen TV over the fireplace. Griffin Lescher, 11, stomping snow from his boots, recounted the tale of chasing his snowboard down the mountain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If they so chose, the children could commandeer their own bunk room on the lower level of the house. To accommodate up to eight Mr. Landry designed four bunk-bed units with built-in drawers and storage, constructed in alderwood with a warm brown finish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A walk-in closet houses eight locker-size spaces for the younger guests' belongings. In the bathroom oversize sinks with multiple faucets anchor each end of a long counter. The 7-by-3-foot glass-tiled multi-headed shower is big enough for a shampoo party.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adults can retreat to the upper-level suites. The house is unpretentious and uncontrived but it is also, to be sure, elegant and sumptuous. Voluminous swaths of silk and taffeta draperies rustle to the floor in every room to provide privacy at night. All of the bathrooms shimmer with glass tiles in unexpected color patterns, like cocoa, pale aqua and muted mustard. In the master bath, an oversize soak tub fills from a spout in the ceiling, and music can be accessed through a 12-button control panel. The house's hydronic heating system keeps floors on all three levels warm enough to tread barefoot all winter long.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such luxurious details are a Landry trademark. Whether the project is an Italian villa, French chateau or Tudor manor, all of Mr. Landry's work has certain elements in common, said the architecture critic Paul Goldberger. What matters to Mr. Landry is that a house ''has a good floor plan, well-scaled interior spaces, well-proportioned facades and elegant detailing,'' Mr. Goldberger wrote in the forward to a monograph of Mr. Landry's work. ''He knows how to place a house on the land, and he pays attention to the way in which his clients say they want to live.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the mountains turned pale purple in the afternoon light, a portrait of how Mr. Landry wants to live was being assembled. Jamie Lescher crowded around the fire pit with her husband, Marc, and a raft of others. A coatless Bria climbed on a handy lap for warmth. A carafe of wine was poured. Ms. Lescher, wine glass in hand, happily confirmed that Mr. Landry seems to have achieved his goal of gathering people together to have fun in a dazzling environment. ''It's simple,'' she said. ''We ski, eat, drink, talk, go to sleep, wake up. Repeat.'' All part of the architect's design.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- A huge wave of mortgage failures on commercial real estate could hit next year, causing banks to lose as much as $300 billion, imperiling lending for small businesses and hindering the economic recovery, a Congressional panel is warning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a report to be released on Thursday, the Congressional Oversight Panel, which is responsible for reviewing the Treasury's $700 billion bailout program, said commercial loan losses could jeopardize the stability of many banks, particularly the nation's midsize and smaller banks, contributing to prolonged weakness throughout the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The panel's chairwoman, Elizabeth Warren, has been pressing the Treasury to compel thousands of banks to undergo stress tests like the ones that the Federal Reserve required of 19 of the country's biggest financial institutions early last year. The Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, has called that idea impractical.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He acknowledged, however, that many community banks had greater exposure than the largest banks to a downturn in commercial real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From 2010 to 2014, about $1.4 trillion in commercial real estate loans will reach the end of their terms, according to the report, a copy of which was provided by the panel to The New York Times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commercial property values have fallen more than 40 percent since the start of 2007, and nearly half of the loans coming due are ''underwater,'' meaning the borrower owes more than the property is worth, according to the report. Vacancy rates are as varied as 8 percent for multifamily housing to 18 percent for office buildings, and rents have fallen 40 percent for office space and 33 percent for retail space, the report states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokesman for the Commercial Mortgage Securities Association, a trade group, said it could not comment on the report until it was released.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Told of the report's findings, Camden R. Fine, the chief executive of the Independent Community Bankers Association, said he believed the warnings were exaggerated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We believe that the Congressional Oversight Panel overstates the threat commercial real estate loans present to the vast majority of community banks nationwide,'' he said. ''While there are certain specific areas of the country where commercial real estate is very weak, in other regions of the country commercial real estate is stable.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fine said he thought that more than 90 percent of an estimated 8,000 community banks ''are strong, stable and growing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Warren, in an interview, said the report was intended to sound an alarm rather than make particular policy recommendations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are a lot of the tools in the toolbox that might be used to deal with the problem, and the effectiveness depends on how fast the policy makers get started,'' she said. ''There is no single fix here. It's a big bubble that has to come down, and that means substantial losses for investors, and for the banks that lent them money.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She added: ''It's important to worry about the contagion effect. Much of this is about how to manage the losses, and how to keep them confined.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Treasury did not have a formal response to the report, because officials had not seen it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Warren said, ''The Treasury needs to make sure it's got its arms around this problem and is working with banking regulators to assess the impact of the problem and to have emergency plans in place.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the height of the boom, the Dursts, the Rudins, the Roses, the LeFraks and other members of New York's royal real estate families were treated like slow-moving dinosaurs on the verge of extinction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although they had spent more than five decades carving their names into the New York skyline, the families were outbid and sometimes outmaneuvered by the newer, flashier speculators and investors who swaggered down Manhattan streets buying one skyscraper after another at record-setting prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now that some of the record-breakers are desperately trying to fend off lenders or teetering at the edge of bankruptcy, these families are looking like wise veterans. They are in relatively healthy financial shape and eager to do deals. They do not necessarily take pleasure in the downfall of the upstarts, but they do relish the fact that, as one scion said with a bit of exaggeration, ''Now, we're the only ones breathing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A group led by the LeFraks is interested in buying Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village, a complex of 11,227 apartments near the East River whose current owner defaulted on $4.4 billion in loans. The Rudins and other families are looking at the Carlton House, an apartment-hotel building on Madison Avenue that is for sale. The Dursts, who like the Rudins and the LeFraks are in their fourth generation in New York real estate, are looking to buy a stake in the $3 billion skyscraper under construction at 1 World Trade Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What the families have a claim to is that they never go away,'' said Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York. ''When this economic crisis goes away, they'll still be here. We'll see about the other guys.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not every segment of the city's powerful real estate industry is wobbling. Some publicly traded real estate companies, including Boston Properties, <span class="companylink">SL Green Realty</span>, <span class="companylink">Brookfield Properties</span> and <span class="companylink">Vornado Realty Trust</span>, have recovered from drops in stock share prices 2008 and are stockpiling cash to buy distressed properties at steep discounts. Even though Tishman Speyer Properties, an organization rooted in one of the old families, stumbled with Stuyvesant Town, it sold $10 billion in property at the top of the market and claims returns of 20 percent a year for investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some of the others are in deep trouble. The developer Kent Swig lost control of his most high-profile project -- Sheffield57, a condominium conversion project on the Upper West Side that he bought from the Roses in 2005 for $418 million -- and may tumble into personal bankruptcy. Scott Lawlor, chief executive of Broadway Partners, who spent $15 billion buying 28 office buildings in 2006 and 2007, has been forced to drastically retrench.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shaya Boymelgreen, who built thousands of luxury condominiums in Manhattan and Brooklyn in recent years, is under siege from lenders and condo owners, while facing eviction from his headquarters. Laurence Gluck, chief executive of Stellar Management, faces foreclosure on Riverton Houses, the middle-class housing complex in Harlem that he bought in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike the real estate families, most of the newcomers used other people's money while taking large management and development fees. Pension funds, insurance companies, foreign investors and banks poured billions of dollars into their deals. Lenders provided relatively cheap financing and required little equity. The deals were built on expectations that prices and values would soar forever, or at least until they could resell properties at a profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The debt they piled on top of the equity was startling,'' said Douglas Durst, whose family owns 10 prime office buildings in Manhattan. Among them is the 52-story 1 Bryant Park tower on 42nd Street, the largest office tower built during the boom on land assembled over four decades. ''The real estate families use their own equity because they want to earn money on it. They're not looking for fees.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">William C. Rudin, the third-generation chief executive of Rudin Management, which owns 16 office buildings and 20 apartment houses in Manhattan, said: ''We've always underwritten our development based on very conservative standards. With land prices and construction prices going up a couple years ago, we didn't find a lot of opportunities that made sense.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the oldest real estate families trace their roots back to the early 1900s, when their patriarchs arrived from Eastern Europe. By the mid-1970s, they had emerged as a powerful political and economic force in New York, even as some of the family empires crumbled during the decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their names are chiseled into the stonework at many of the city's institutions, from NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital (Milstein) to New York University (Stern) to the Museum of Natural History (Rose) to the Guggenheim Museum (LeFrak).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What distinguishes the families from other real estate players is that they buy property but rarely sell. They usually have relatively low levels of debt on their buildings, and they do a couple of projects every economic cycle rather than go on a binge, a practice adopted after bitter experiences with a deep recession in the 1970s. The families' supremacy was challenged in the 1990s by the rise of publicly traded real estate companies and private equity firms. Land and construction prices began to soar, raising stakes for anyone undertaking a big residential or commercial project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, the top three commercial landlords are public companies: SL Green, Vornado and Brookfield, which together account for 55.7 million square feet of office space. The top seven families in commercial real estate have about 41.2 million square feet, according to a compilation by <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>, a real estate broker. Mr. Spinola, of the real estate board, said, ''The pie has gotten a lot bigger, and the families' share has gotten smaller.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The families are also having to compete for deals with longtime developers like Stephen M. Ross of the Related Companies, one of the city's most prolific developers, who adopted a corporate model of working with both investors and partners to spread his risk. In the 2006 bidding for Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village, the LeFraks and the Milsteins together offered $3.2 billion, but lost out to a partnership of Tishman Speyer and BlackRock Realty that paid $5.4 billion. (It is now estimated to be worth $1.9 billion.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one is immune to the recession, Mr. Rudin said. He is losing his anchor tenant at 32 Avenue of the Americas, <span class="companylink">AT&amp;T</span>, to a less-expensive building downtown. But the family has reserved the funds that will enable it to operate until it secures a new tenant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adam R. Rose, co-president of Rose Associates, said: ''We take no pleasure in seeing any of our colleagues experience catastrophic events. However, there is a distinct and qualitative difference between a long-term perspective, which yields better decisions, and a short-term perspective, which leads to mistakes.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IF the mix of optimism and uncertainty that pervades the New York residential real estate market right now can be symbolized by one property, a leading candidate may well be the penthouse at 1055 Park Avenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two-bedroom two-bath duplex, atop a new all-glass condominium building on the narrowest of lots in one of the most exclusive of neighborhoods, went on the market on Oct. 5, at an asking price of $9.3 million. Within 17 days the price was slashed, to $7.5 million. And there it has stood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, at last, a buyer has come along who wants to make an offer. But one thing is holding him back. He won't proceed until he learns the exact dollar amount of the bonus he is expecting from his employer, a Wall Street bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so it is with much of the New York-area market, from downtown lofts to Hamptons mansions. With the outsize bonus returning to Wall Street this year, brokers and sellers are holding their breath. For the past few months there have been signs that the market is reawakening, and an infusion of ''banker cash'' could be just the catalyst it needs to spark a full-fledged recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But just how powerful a force the bonus money will be is still in question. For all the bankers showing up at open houses, deal after deal seems to be in limbo, its fate hinging on bonus money, as with the penthouse at 1055 Park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The bankers are back,'' said Pamela Liebman, the president of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>. But, she said, this year the effect is ''more about the confidence than the cash.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By that she means that reports of large bonus pools at Wall Street firms have contributed to an overall sense among prospective buyers that things are getting better, not worse. And brokers say that the rise of the stock market last year, along with very low mortgage rates and prices that have sunk a good 20 to 25 percent below 2007 highs, had already started to calm the nerves of buyers at all income levels. Now there is a growing sense that the best deals will be history once the bonus buyers start signing contracts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one indication of increasing interest in higher-end properties, searches for listings of New York City homes priced above $2 million and above $5 million on the real estate search engine Trulia.com have grown significantly. In December 2009, the latest full month for which figures were available, searches for homes over $2 million grew 24 percent compared with December 2008. Searches for homes priced above $5 million increased 13 percent over the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one expects a return to the days when a banker, bonus in hand, went out, looked at five fancy properties in a day and picked one. Brokers say that Wall Street clients are much more careful in their shopping and deal-making these days -- and that, like everyone else, they are looking for bargains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Even my customers who are billionaires are shopping smart,'' said Susan Breitenbach, a senior vice president at Corcoran in the Hamptons. Another change: many bonuses -- particularly those of the highest echelon of earners -- will be paid in stock this year, not cash, a curb on any impetus toward reckless spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, some transactions that seem more reminiscent of 2006 than the past year are starting to emerge:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Hamptons, a buyer from Wall Street paid $19 million for an oceanfront property in Sagaponack last month. Word is he plans to tear it down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A three-bedroom condo at 1 Morton Square in the West Village went on the market for $2.75 million in early January. It was snapped up in just four days, for more than the asking price. There were three all-cash offers -- from a <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> banker, from a banker at another Wall Street firm, and from someone in ''new media,'' said Darren Sukenik, the listing broker and a managing director at Prudential Douglas Elliman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The banker from the other Wall Street firm prevailed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's like this flight to sanity,'' Mr. Sukenik said. People in finance aren't using their bonus money to buy ''a red Ferrari or two weeks in St. Barts,'' he explained. ''Now they're using their bonuses to enter smart, sound real estate purchases.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the outrage in some quarters over bonuses, house-hunting recipients are both discreet and reluctant to be interviewed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''More important these days than ever before is anonymity, doing it under the radar,'' said Tim Davis, a senior managing director at <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, who has been selling real estate in the Hamptons for 30 years. Most Wall Street buyers, he said, are ''staying away from high-profile properties, saying, 'I don't want to be seen as buying X.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephen Seremetis, 37, an executive director of investments at Oppenheimer &amp;Company, is in contract to buy a 2,994-square-foot loft in a new Jersey City development called Mercury Lofts at the Beacon. The space has a 60-foot living room, 20 windows and, he says, ''phenomenal views'' of the Statue of Liberty and the Manhattan skyline. (Amenities in the complex include a Bloomberg box, a clear sign that the place is catering to the Wall Street set.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Seremetis said he was content with his bonus this year, but he stressed that it was not his only reason for buying. Instead, he said, after a year of searching in Manhattan, New Jersey and Long Island City, he became convinced that prices had fallen as low as they were going to go.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's more the value now,'' he said. ''Real estate has bottomed out, and it's time to step in.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Seremetis paid under $1 million, he said, for a half floor of space -- a bargain by Manhattan standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traffic is up markedly at open houses all over the city for apartments with asking prices over $1 million, and buyers who work in finance account for 40 to 75 percent of the crowd. More than 100 people turned out for an open house for a two-bedroom in the Village a couple of weeks ago. The elevator broke, but people took the stairs without complaining.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last Sunday, a frigid winter day, Kathryn Higgins, an associate broker at DJK Residential, accompanied clients to an open house at a prewar co-op in the East 80s. So many people showed up, she said, that ''for the first time in two years, I had to wait in the lobby. My mouth was hanging open.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although reports of large bonus pools at a number of firms have been widespread, some employees have yet to hear their personal ''number.'' That will happen over the next several weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Karin Posvar-Picket, a senior vice president at Corcoran, recently reached a deal on a four-bedroom condo for more than $4 million at the <span class="companylink">Georgica</span> on the Upper East Side. But, she said, the buyer ''is waiting for his bonus to hit'' before he proceeds with the closing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of her colleagues, Ms. Breitenbach in the Hamptons, had an offer on a property from a Wall Street buyer; the owner responded with a counteroffer. A day went by, but she heard nothing from the bidder. Ms. Breitenbach called his broker to find out what was going on. The answer: The buyer's bonus was to be paid in stock, and he had to see how much he could borrow on it before he could raise his offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wise bankers know that it's best not to put the cart before the horse even when a fat payout is anticipated. Adrienne Albert, the chief executive of the Marketing Directors, a marketing and sales agent of residential real estate, said her firm lost a bonus-inspired sale at the Crystal Point luxury development on the Jersey City waterfront. The buyer, who had already signed a contract, backed out when she learned that her bonus would be smaller than she had hoped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was heartbreaking for us,'' Ms. Albert said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, behemoth bonus, so-so bonus orno bonus at all, buyers appear to be stirring from their fear and torpor. Take the recent bidding on a one-bedroom condo with a terrace on East Ninth Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property was first listed in June 2009. ''We were holding open houses diligently every other week,'' said the broker, Tristan Harper, a senior vice president at Prudential Douglas Elliman. But the traffic was almost nonexistent. ''Zero to five parties, max,'' Mr. Harper said. The seller took the property off the market for the December holidays, then put it back on in early January in hopes of benefiting from a bonus bounce. At the first open house, 18 parties showed up, 30 to 40 percent of them from Wall Street. Mr. Harper was stunned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within a day he had an offer. It was under the asking price of $1.049 million, but the owner was able to negotiate for a little more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the place was in contract, the seller received a significantly better offer -- above the asking price -- from two men. One of them worked on Wall Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then the original bidder matched that offer with all cash. In the meantime, a third offer came in, but the specter arose of all three bidders' fleeing if a bidding war ensued, so the seller never really entertained it. The first bidder won, at a price slightly over asking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was like the good times again,'' Mr. Harper said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of an editing error, the ''Living In'' article last Sunday, about Belmont, the Bronx, misstated the residency status of Puerto Rican residents of the area. Because Puerto Rico is a commonwealth of the United States, they are citizens -- not immigrants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Sun Feb 14 2010</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE other day in the Belmont section of the Bronx, two women carrying shopping bags conversed excitedly as they ambled down Crescent Avenue. One wore black winter gear from head to toe; her companion had on jeans and stylish black boots. Something marked their conversation as unusual: half was in Italian and the other in Spanish. But they clearly understood each other.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So it is in Belmont, now and perhaps forever known as the Little Italy of the Bronx -- or, to some, ''the real Little Italy'' -- and the subject of longstanding lore. The neighborhood was the breeding ground for Dion and the Belmonts in the 1950s and the setting for Chazz Palminteri's ''Bronx Tale,'' a childhood memoir that he has toured the country to perform. (Robert De Niro's film version came out in 1993.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To this day Arthur Avenue, Belmont's main artery, remains a thriving marketplace of menuless trattorias and pork stores par excellence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''On any Saturday or any holiday, any given weekend, you cannot walk,'' said Ivine Galarza, the district manager of Community Board 6 for the last 15 years. ''It is so congested. People come from all over -- Jersey, Connecticut -- to get their meats.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what is it like to live there?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outside Arthur Avenue and its sister commercial strip, East 187th Street, the neighborhood's Italian standbys become sparse; instead, there is Tu y Yo Unisex Salon and La Iglesia Que Se Va.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An influx of students from Fordham University, just north of Belmont across Fordham Road, makes up a sizable part of the population, alongside communities of Puerto Rican and Albanian immigrants. (The restaurant Rozafa on Crescent Avenue serves both chicken marsala and Albanian speca te mbushur, a type of stuffed pepper.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, far from a museum piece or a shopping mall, the area is a functioning community where people get along.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of people say, 'Move!' No. I like it here,'' said Marie Riolo, 90, who moved to Belmont early in life and has lived in the same building since 1941. Now the secretary of the local community board and chairwoman of its senior citizen committee, Mrs. Riolo is friendly with the students in her building on Lorillard Place and still visits all the same shops she has for years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other end of the spectrum is Thomas Conroy, 21, a Fordham senior from Maryland who lives in a Hoffman Street apartment with five roommates, for which he pays about $600 a month. After two years of frequenting local shops, he has learned to follow the local loyalty rules when it comes to meats and cheeses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You feel like you're betraying them if you go somewhere else,'' said Mr. Conroy, a devotee of Tino's Delicatessen on Arthur Avenue. ''It's my ritual now; I go there once a week.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT YOU'LL FIND</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Roughly eight blocks long at its longest point and nine blocks wide at its widest, Belmont is hemmed in to the east by Bronx Park. But on other flanks, it has seen enough shifting of boundaries over the last few decades that there is no longer any firm definition of where it ends and where the rest of the Bronx begins. The southern border is generally thought to be either 182nd or 183rd Street; the dividing line then snakes up Third Avenue, at some point turning north to hit Fordham Road, the clear northern boundary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outside of the area around 187th Street and Arthur Avenue, where a new business improvement district was recently approved, Belmont consists largely of two- and three-family houses, though apartment buildings appear here and there. Some homes are in pristine condition, decorated to the nines for whatever holiday is approaching. A few are boarded up or have sat empty since construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Busy Fordham Road winds west into Fordham Plaza, a frenetic shopping area with all the staple chain stores and also the neighborhood stop on the <span class="companylink">Metro-North Railroad</span>. There is talk in Belmont both for and against the idea of a new 13-story mixed-use building on Fordham Road; community hearings took place last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Belmont doesn't contain an excess of green space, perhaps because Bronx Park is close by, but a small community garden called Belmont Little Farmers is in operation on Belmont Avenue. On East 188th Street, children swing to and fro at the Ciccarone Playground, which had $2.7 million in renovations in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crime remains a concern. In 2009, the precinct that includes the neighborhood had 7 murders, 383 robberies and 362 felony assaults, according to the police CompStat system. A few well-publicized crimes last year did not help matters, including the early-morning murder last August of a former area lounge owner behind the Arthur Avenue Retail Market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT YOU'LL PAY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like many Bronx neighborhoods, Belmont has had its share of foreclosures and short sales in recent years; the phenomenon has had the effect of dragging down prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Right now nobody knows where the real estate market is,'' said Pasquale Perretta, a former Fordham professor who owns a rental agency called Belmont Realty. ''It's still a very precarious situation. There is an abundance now, a glut of housing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the best way to find property for sale is to wander the avenues and look for houses with for-sale signs attached. Few brokerages outside of rental agencies focus on the neighborhood, which makes Internet searches difficult; those with units on the market are typically based elsewhere in the Bronx or even farther afield.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Properties for purchase are by and large two- or three-family houses; if there is an apartment to be had, it is most likely for rent. In general, said Jennie Ng, broker and owner of ERA Champions Realty, single-family houses can be found starting in the $200,000 range, and two-family semidetached houses sell for about $400,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The same two-family brick homes would have sold for $440,000 or $460,000 a year ago,'' Ms. Ng said. Last year, she sold a single-family house on 183rd Street for $220,000. Comparable-sales reports from recent months show the price per square foot in the neighborhood hovering around $140.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The area also has a dose of ''For Rent'' signs, thanks in part to its still-growing student population. Two-bedroom apartments close to the Fordham campus generally cost about $1,400 a month, less if they are below 187th Street. One-bedrooms can be found for around $800.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A study released last March by the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University found that Belmont, coupled with the nearby neighborhood of Morrisania, had the city's third-lowest homeownership rate. The study also found that the area's median monthly rent, when combined with nearby East Tremont's, was $655, perhaps owing to the neighborhood's supply of low-income housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT TO DO</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you've stocked up on all the soppressata, pecorino Romano and zeppole you can handle on Arthur Avenue, venture east toward Southern Boulevard, where the Bronx Zoo, Bronx Park and, a bit farther north, the New York Botanical Garden all reside. Also northward, at Fordham University, continuing education courses on offer include medieval studies and anthropology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE SCHOOLS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year at Public School 32, the Belmont School, on East 183rd Street, 94.7 percent of students met standards in math, 77.1 percent in English. At Middle School 45, the Thomas C. Giordano School, on Lorillard Place, 61.6 percent met standards in English, 75.1 percent in math. SAT averages at Belmont Preparatory High School on Fordham Road were 357 in reading, 357 in math and 360 in writing. The most recent statewide averages were 531, 563 and 535.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the private possibilities in Belmont are two Catholic schools: the all-girl Aquinas High School on East 182nd Street and St. Martin of Tours School for prekindergarten through Grade 8.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE COMMUTE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nearest option for commuting into Manhattan is the Fordham Road <span class="companylink">Metro-North Railroad</span>, near Third Avenue. The ride into Grand Central Terminal is about 20 minutes; one-way peak tickets are $7; a monthly pass is $164. The closest subway is the Fordham Road station on the B and D lines, about a 15-minute walk from the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE HISTORY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Belmont was once the province of the Lorillard family, for whom a street is named. After moving its tobacco operations to the Central Bronx from Lower Manhattan in the late 18th century, the family greatly expanded its property in the area, with its land known as the Belmont estate. But after the Lorillards decamped for New Jersey in 1870, the city acquired part of their land for Bronx Park; another section was divided into the streets that form Belmont today. (The Lorillards are still in business, as anyone who smokes Newports or Kents might tell you.)</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ENTICED by notions of buying a home to grow into, Erica Brembos and her husband, Satya Maganti, thought about getting a big house and a big yard in the suburbs of northern New Jersey. After all, Ms. Brembos said, it was ''common wisdom'' that people got ''more space for your money in the suburbs.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Brembos, a native of Neptune, N.J., and a graduate of the Parsons School of Design, works as the creative resources director for the Parenting group of magazines. She was renting a studio in Riverdale, the Bronx (an affordable ''single girl in the city kind of place,'' she says), when she and Mr. Maganti, a native of Mumbai, India, met online.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He had a pharmacy degree when he arrived in New York in 2000 for graduate studies in management information systems at Baruch College. He lived first in Jersey City and later rented a small one-bedroom apartment on the Upper East Side. He works as a project manager for a technology consulting firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three years ago the two, who are now in their early 30s, moved together to a two-bedroom in the Gotham, a high-rise rental building in Jersey City. Mr. Maganti, already familiar with the neighborhood, knew they could afford a spacious apartment there. The rent was around $2,450 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the couple married two years ago, ''we were thinking about buying only in the abstract,'' Ms. Brembos said. But Mr. Maganti, who grew up in a low-rise apartment building, harbored dreams of buying. ''In India, it's regarded very highly to have your own place,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last spring, with housing prices low, the couple went house-hunting in several northern New Jersey towns for a house with a yard suitable for a vegetable garden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But then they considered commuting costs, including train tickets and parking. Because their work hours differ, they might even have needed a second car. Mr. Maganti has colleagues with two-hour commutes. ''Nobody said they enjoyed their commute,'' he said. ''What they did say was they enjoyed where they lived.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple also had mixed feelings about the upkeep of a house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end, suburban living seemed too complicated. ''We were trying to wedge all this stuff in, and we came to our senses when we started poking around at condos just to compare,'' Ms. Brembos said. ''The vegetable garden started to look not so appealing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They decided instead on ''urban New Jersey,'' along the Hudson River, planning to find a condominium in the $600,000s with abundant space indoors and out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Jersey City, Ms. Brembos said, they saw odd layouts and high prices. They saw more viable possibilities in Hoboken, and Mr. Maganti preferred the feel of it anyway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An enormous grassy backyard was the draw at a three-bedroom brick condo on Monroe Street, listed at $629,900, but the lack of a parking spot was a problem. ''Parking in Hoboken is touchy,'' because of the area's density, said their agent, Lindsey Brown of Halstead Property New Jersey in Hoboken. ''You can circle the block for 20 minutes sometimes.'' (That house later sold for $612,000.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearby, on Madison Street, they loved a two-bedroom stucco town house with a three-car garage. It was pricey, at $699,000. ''So therefore we had to be logical,'' Mr. Maganti said. ''I am a little bit of an emotional buyer, and Erica is my voice of reason.'' (That one sold for $695,000.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They had trouble scheduling a visit to another condo on Monroe Street -- this one listed at $649,000 -- because the seller was ill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Brembos finally saw it while her husband was working. ''I wasn't 100 percent sure he would like it,'' she said, ''but I liked it a lot.'' The duplex had two bedrooms, a den and three bathrooms, though she wasn't crazy about the spiral staircase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the balcony was ''not the dream outdoor space we thought we would want, but the other things balanced it out,'' Ms. Brembos said. Besides, parking was now more important than outdoor space, and there was a parking space beneath the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for Mr. Maganti, ''it took me a while to see the potential in the apartment,'' he said. ''Lindsay said that very seldom do you see a place where there is no wasted space and such a nice open layout.'' So, last fall, the two bought the apartment for $615,000. Monthly maintenance is just over $500; yearly taxes are around $9,500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, they revel in their 1,500 square feet. ''You are not scooting around furniture or whatever we all had to do when we lived in the city,'' Ms. Brembos said. The balcony is large enough for chairs and a container garden. It's tough, however, to navigate the spiral staircase with a laundry basket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Problems with upkeep have been unavoidable. The two weren't prepared for the many projects their new home involved, like plumbing and heating repairs and painting. ''Those were the things we really sweated about the first few times, and now we laugh about them,'' Ms. Brembos said. They are nearing the end of a dusty and nerve-racking kitchen renovation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One thing they had neglected to consider was noise. Their upstairs neighbors had a baby who cried in the night. That family moved, but the new neighbor is a young women who seems to walk in high heels. In many ways it's noisier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We talked it out and said this is the one price we pay to have this great apartment,'' Ms. Brembos said. ''I am always of the mind to see how much you can tolerate before you start complaining.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They have dropped the idea of the suburbs, at least for now. Ms. Brembos said she couldn't imagine what would make her want to move farther out and commute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Maganti has his eye on a few Hoboken homes with even more space and bigger yards, and ''where, if luck were to be with me in the next couple of years,'' he wouldn't mind moving eventually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Erica is very content, and I'm a little bit of a restless soul,'' he said. ''I am curious about what the suburban lifestyle is like. I wouldn't mind moving to the suburbs if they had high-speed rail.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">East Garden City</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FOR decades, military officers and their families have flown flags from the porticos of their tidy brick colonial homes along ''General's Row'' in Mitchel Field here. But with the military presence on Long Island dwindling, that era is coming to a close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a $35 million transaction, <span class="companylink">AvalonBay Communities</span>, the developer, is taking the site over from the Navy. On part of the property, closing took place in 2007; the rest is expected to change hands officially later this year, said Matthew B. Whalen, a vice president of <span class="companylink">AvalonBay Communities</span>, which is based in Alexandria, Va. The company has built several rental complexes on the Island and has plans to develop more, including a 349-unit transit-oriented development in Rockville Centre and 530 units of mixed rental, market-rate and affordable housing in Huntington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mitchel Field was built by the Army Air Corps in 1929 to protect New York City. It remained an active base until it closed in 1961. It was almost two months ago that AvalonBay received zoning approval from the Town of Hempstead, the site of Mitchel Field, to build a community of 160 one-, two- and three-bedroom luxury rental apartments, 44 two- and three-bedroom town houses, a clubhouse and a pool on the former base, Mr. Whalen said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As part of the deal, the 19 officers' homes along General's Row on Ellington Avenue East, built after World War II and continuously occupied since then, will be refurbished with new kitchens, baths and in, some cases, roofs. Sewers and water lines will be redone and the street repaved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All these treasures will be preserved,'' Mr. Whalen said. ''They have solid bones,'' he added, describing the street, with its canopy of towering trees, as beautiful. The four- to five-bedroom houses, some with sunrooms, fireplaces and garages, are appraised for about $700,000. Once renovated, they will be sold as single-family private homes. One new colonial will be built on an empty lot at the end of the block.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the other homes in the 111-residence enclave -- a remnant of one of the largest military bases in the metropolitan area -- some will be demolished. Others will be given to adjacent Nassau Community College; eight will be refurbished for injured veterans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently, active-duty personnel from all branches of the armed forces live on the base, though as Mr. Whalen put it, ''there has been natural attrition of the military residents.'' Seventy percent of the homes are occupied, but only 50 percent of their residents serve in the military -- many as recruiters, or at desk jobs in New York for the Air Force, Army or Navy. The rest of the homes are owned by AvalonBay and are for rent; others are owned by the Navy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those remaining families will relocate to garden-apartment-style military housing at Mitchel Manor in East Meadow, Mr. Whalen said. A representative of <span class="companylink">Balfour Beatty</span> Communities, which operates the military housing at Mitchel Manor and Mitchel Field, said in an e-mail message that <span class="companylink">Balfour Beatty</span> was in negotiations and could not discuss the ''the positive redevelopment of the Mitchel Field complex.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kate Murray, the Hempstead town supervisor, said that the zoning approval had depended in part on the preservation of military homes on Ellington Avenue East -- a very important factor ''given the history of that site.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But not far away, on Ellington Avenue West, 13 duplexes and the rows of garages behind them -- as well as another five houses on Stewart Avenue -- will be knocked down to make room for the town houses and rentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 13 duplexes, some in disrepair, once housed lower-ranking officers and ''are not as architecturally attractive,'' Mr. Whalen said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In keeping with the traditional feel of the neighborhood, the rentals will be contained in buildings designed to resemble three-story ''manor houses.'' They are intended for a market of singles, young professionals and empty-nesters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet another element of the plan calls for retrofitting eight homes for disabled veterans. Mr. Whalen said that four two-story duplex residences would be renovated for use by injured personnel from Iraq and Afghanistan, under the auspices of a Massachusetts nonprofit group called Homes for Our Troops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vicki Thomas, a spokeswoman for the group, said that nationwide it had built 50 single-story homes for injured veterans and had 30 under construction. Each structure, she said, is adapted ''to accommodate the severity'' of a particular veteran's injury.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hempstead gave AvalonBay the right to increase the density on the base in exchange for the company's donation of 13 acres of base property to adjacent Nassau Community College and 10 acres to Nassau County.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chuck Cutolo, director of governmental affairs for the college, said it was contemplating using one of the 22 colonial homes it will receive as a bed-and-breakfast. This, he said, would be a way of ''enhancing the course offerings'' of its hospitality business department, to give students ''a more realistic learning environment in areas such as food service and hotel management.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cutolo said the county and the college first met with the Navy in 2002, a few years after a law went into effect giving the military authority to privatize property. The Navy property includes homes along Miller Avenue abutting the campus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cutolo said the college would avoid, at least on that block, doing ''anything to affect the historic facades.'' Another of the properties, an old day care center, may be used as conference space, Mr. Cutolo said. Similarly, an old theater, ''now a mess inside and vacant inside,'' may be used by the college in some creative way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot would have to be done to make classroom space and bring it up to code,'' he added, estimating that it would take about a year for final governmental and administrative approvals before the college had control of the property.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gubner, 43, is the president and chief executive of RHYS Commercial, a full-service commercial real estate company based in Stamford, Conn., that he founded last fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gubner founded Chase Commercial Real Estate in 1998 and combined it with <span class="companylink">GVA Williams</span> in 2002. Later that company was merged into FirstService Williams, which recently became part of Colliers International.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q This might not be the best time to start another commercial real estate company, right?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A That's probably the question I've been asked the most, other than what does the company name mean or how do you pronounce it. I look at it as a good time to differentiate ourselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We certainly acknowledge that the marketplace is not good, but we're busy. And we thought that to build up a firm in today's market might actually be easier than in a good market, because our clients need us more now than ever.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q What does the company name mean, and how is it pronounced?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Rhys is my middle name. It's a Welsh name. It means passion or enthusiasm, so maybe my parents had some goals in mind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's pronounced Rise -- like rise and conquer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q What is the focus of RHYS?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A The firm was set up to do five things: office leasing, retail leasing, investment sales, property management and consulting. We advise clients on how to lease, sell or manage their properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I started the firm to fill what I saw as a gap in commercial real estate. You have global players, like the CBREs, and then the localized players, the Joe's Real Estates. Gone from the marketplace was the big regional firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q So you do business only</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">in New York, New Jersey and</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Connecticut?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Our focus is purely on the tristate marketplace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. You once operated a regional firm, Chase Commercial, which you merged with <span class="companylink">GVA Williams</span>; then that company merged with FirstService. Any regrets?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A I think I had this conversation with my wife about 800 times. No, I have no regrets whatsoever. We had a great six-year run. I learned a lot about New York City real estate; they learned a lot about suburban real estate. We made money together. It was a wonderful relationship, right up until the sale of the company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Why did you leave</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FirstService?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A The main reason I left was just different management ideas. I believe that commercial real estate is more of a local or regional business; their belief is that it is a global business and that each office should be run a certain way. I believe that different markets dictate running things a little differently, and you have to adapt to the marketplace, service your clients in a certain way in that particular marketplace. It's not the same everywhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q How is your new business</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">doing so far?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A We have over 100 clients. We have over 90 exclusive listings on the landlord side and over 25 tenant representation assignments on just the retail side alone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our largest office building is 750 East Main Street in Stamford, developed by Sands Brothers. We have about 60,000 square feet available for lease in that building. We have some pretty good action on it right now, and if all the deals happen, we could be fully leased by the end of the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I would probably say that Stop &amp;Shop, along with Michaels crafts store, Panera Bread and <span class="companylink">AT&amp;T Wireless</span>, are our biggest clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Are you profitable yet?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A No. There's a lot of start-up costs, but we expect to be turning a profit this spring, which I think is pretty remarkable considering we started in the beginning of October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q What are the biggest</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">expenses?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Property signs, believe it or not. Each time we put up a sign it costs about $800 -- times that by over 90 listings, many of which have more than one sign. So it starts to add up. I think payroll is right up there also. We have 15 employees. We have a big infrastructure in the office of research people and marketing people and analytical people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Where do you see the company by year's end?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Our goal is to be fully entrenched in the tristate area before the end of the year. I hope that within the next 12 months we'll be somewhere at 50 to 75 people companywide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q And what do you do in your spare time?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A You mean the other 12 hours of the day?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LA CANADA FLINTRIDGE, Calif. -- (AP) -- Thunderous mudslides damaged dozens of homes, swept away cars and pushed furniture into the streets of the foothills north of Los Angeles on Saturday as intense winter rain poured down mountains denuded by a summer wildfire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No injuries were reported, but residents and emergency responders were caught off guard by the unexpected ferocity of the storm, which damaged more than 40 homes and dozens of vehicles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five hundred homes were eventually evacuated at the foot of the San Gabriel Mountains after heavy rains overflowed debris basins, carried away concrete barricades and filled houses with mud and rocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some residents complained they had not been told to get out until the brunt of the damage was done. During heavy rains last month, officials repeatedly warned foothill communities to be on alert.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Nobody knew it was going to be this bad,'' said Katherine Markgraf, whose mother's house was filled with more than two feet of mud, debris and tangled tree roots. ''Last time, they started warning us in time to prepare for it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Los Angeles County fire inspector, Matt Levesque, said forecasters and county and city officials had not anticipated the magnitude of the slow-moving storm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If we had known there would have been this much rain, Mr. Levesque said, ''we would have evacuated. It was more rain than anyone thought, and more intense too. And it stalled there over the hillsides.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rainfall totals topped four inches in a 24-hour period in some areas, the National Weather Service said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The evacuations were ordered in the foothill areas of Sierra Madre, La Canada Flintridge, La Crescenta and some parts of Acton.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Evacuation centers were set up at La Canada High School and at a recreation center in Sierra Madre. The Red Cross was working to establish other locations to shelter displaced residents.</p>

</div><div class="author">By CARA BUCKLEY </div><div>553 words</div><div>6 February 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>16</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The people of Edgewater Park have described their home as a Shangri-La, a tightly knit and idyllic community sitting on Long Island Sound in a hidden pocket of the Bronx.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But according to a new lawsuit, not everyone is welcome in this version of paradise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, the Fair Housing Justice Center, a nonprofit group, sued Edgewater Park, its nearby sister community, Silver Beach Gardens, and one of its former longtime residents, the Realtor Amelia Lewis, claiming racial discrimination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The suit, filed in United States District Court in Manhattan, sprang from an investigation the housing group conducted in September and October 2009, in which a white couple and an African-American couple inquired about buying homes in the communities. Both were ''test'' couples who worked for the housing group and said they were looking for homes priced below $300,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both communities, just north of the Throgs Neck Bridge, are cooperatives; residents own their homes but the land is owned collectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the lawsuit, the white woman was warmly welcomed by Ms. Lewis, and was quickly shown nine available homes in both Edgewater Park and Silver Beach Gardens. The white faux buyer voiced the concern that she did not know anyone who lived there; the cooperatives' rules say that prospective buyers must submit three recommendation letters from current residents. But Ms. Lewis replied that she would line up the necessary reference letters, adding ''they would love you, I can tell,'' the suit said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A week and a half later, the African-American couple arrived at Ms. Lewis's office and was almost immediately asked if they knew three people who lived there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When they said they did not, Ms. Lewis said, ''there's no way you're going to get in there,'' the suit said. Ms. Lewis went on to say that Edgewater Park was ''not wonderful for everybody,'' the suit said, adding that it was mostly Irish and Italian, ''kind of prejudice'' and ''like Archie Bunker territory.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end, it said, Ms. Lewis refused to show the African-American couple any home in either Edgewater Park or Silver Beach Gardens. Three calls made to Ms. Lewis's office on Friday were not returned, a lawyer for Silver Beach Gardens declined to comment, and two calls to the lawyer for Edgewater Park were not returned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The suit says that 2000 Census figures show that while blacks account for 35 percent of owner-occupied homes in the Bronx, they account for less than 1 percent of the 1,100 homes in Edgewater Park and Silver Beach Gardens. Diane L. Houk, a lawyer representing the Fair Housing Justice Center, and also its former executive director, said the requirement of three reference letters from existing owners ''sounds neutral at first, but has a discriminatory impact on nonwhites.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The investigation, she said, was prompted by an August article in The New York Times, in which residents said their communities were largely unknown and their streets largely sealed off. Usually it behooves moderately priced communities to get the word out, she said, to drive up demand and prices. ''Any time anything's hidden or secret,'' she said, ''you have to ask, 'Why would you want to be hidden?' ''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Beazer Homes USA</span> posted a quarterly profit on Friday, helped by a hefty tax gain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company said it earned $48 million, or $1.17 a share, in the quarter, reversing a year-earlier loss of $80.3 million, or $2.08 a share. Sales in the period, which ended Dec. 31 and was the first quarter of Beazer's fiscal year, rose only slightly, to $218.8 million, from $218.2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The profit included a tax gain of $101 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stock in Beazer, which is based in Atlanta and caters primarily to first-time home buyers, rose 5 cents, to close at $4.16 a share.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company said orders for new homes increased almost 37 percent compared to year-earlier levels. Completed sales also rose 8 percent from the same period a year earlier. And the number of buyers who backed out of contracts dropped to 27 percent from 46 percent a year earlier, a sign shoppers are gaining confidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The builder has focused on offering more energy-efficient homes. It also has geared up to buy more land this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like other builders, Beazer was helped by low mortgage rates and a tax credit for homebuyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many industry experts question whether the housing recovery will sputter once the tax credits of $8,000 for new buyers and $6,500 for current owners expire at the end of April.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DETAILS The mansion that today forms one wing of the grand Italianate Keswick Hall was built in 1912 not far from Monticello, Thomas Jefferson's estate. Since 1993 the building has been a 48-room luxury hotel, and in 1999 it was acquired by <span class="companylink">Orient-Express Hotels</span>. Now Keswick's gated, 600-acre site holds a golf course designed by Arnold Palmer, two restaurants, a clubhouse with a full-service spa and a collection of second homes on lots ranging from two to eight acres each. Eighty-two houses have been built throughout the community, and the last 39 home sites are on the market. In December a partnership with Robert A. M. Stern Architects was announced that offers buyers the opportunity to choose among five house designs by this firm, whose work has included buildings on the campus of the nearby University of Virginia. From 2,500 to 5,000 square feet, the designs -- one of which is shown -- include details like granite countertops, oversize windows, private terraces and formal gardens. Buyers are free to work with other architects, but designs are subject to approval by the community's board. There are three swimming pools on the site, including one infinity pool, and the resort also offers a fitness center with yoga classes, a croquet lawn and a tennis pavilion with five clay and hard courts. Guided fly-fishing trips can be arranged, and there are wineries in the surrounding area.</p>

</div><div class="author">By DAVID STREITFELD </div><div>1615 words</div><div>3 February 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2006, Benjamin Koellmann bought a condominium in Miami Beach. By his calculation, it will be about the year 2025 before he can sell his modest home for what he paid. Or maybe 2040.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People like me are beginning to feel like suckers,'' Mr. Koellmann said. ''Why not let it go in default and rent a better place for less?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After three years of plunging real estate values, after the bailouts of the bankers and the revival of their million-dollar bonuses, after the Obama administration's loan modification plan raised the expectations of many but satisfied only a few, a large group of distressed homeowners is wondering the same thing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New research suggests that when a home's value falls below 75 percent of the amount owed on the mortgage, the owner starts to think hard about walking away, even if he or she has the money to keep paying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a situation without precedent in the modern era, millions of Americans are in this bleak position. Whether, or how, to help them is one of the biggest questions the Obama administration confronts as it seeks a housing policy that would contribute to the economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We haven't yet found a way of dealing with this that would, we think, be practical on a large scale,'' the assistant Treasury secretary for financial stability, Herbert M. Allison Jr., said in a recent briefing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of Americans who owed more than their homes were worth was virtually nil when the real estate collapse began in mid-2006, but by the third quarter of 2009, an estimated 4.5 million homeowners had reached the critical threshold, with their home's value dropping below 75 percent of the mortgage balance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are stretched, aggrieved and restless. With figures released last week showing that the real estate market was stalling again, their numbers are now projected to climb to a peak of 5.1 million by June -- about 10 percent of all Americans with mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're now at the point of maximum vulnerability,'' said Sam Khater, a senior economist with First American CoreLogic, the firm that conducted the recent research. ''People's emotional attachment to their property is melting into the air.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suggestions that people would be wise to renege on their home loans are at least a couple of years old, but they are turning into a full-throated barrage. Bloggers were quick to note recently that landlords of an 11,000-unit residential complex in Manhattan showed no hesitation, or shame, in walking away from their deeply underwater investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Since the beginning of December, I've advised 60 people to walk away,'' said Steve Walsh, a mortgage broker in Scottsdale, Ariz. ''Everyone has lost hope. They don't qualify for modifications, and being on the hamster wheel of paying for a property that is not worth it gets so old.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Walsh is taking his own advice, recently defaulting on a rental property he owns. ''The sun will come up tomorrow,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The difference between letting your house go to foreclosure because you are out of money and purposefully defaulting on a mortgage to save money can be murky. But a growing body of research indicates that significant numbers of borrowers are declining to live under what some waggishly call ''house arrest.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using credit bureau data, consultants at <span class="companylink">Oliver Wyman</span> calculated how many borrowers went straight from being current on their mortgage to default, rather than making spotty payments. They also weeded out owners having trouble paying other bills. Their estimate was that about 17 percent of owners defaulting in 2008, or 588,000 people, chose that option as a strategic calculation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some experts argue that walking away from mortgages is more discussed than done. People hate moving; their children attend the neighborhood school; they do not want to think of themselves as skipping out on a debt. Doubters cite a Federal Reserve study using historical data from Massachusetts that concludes there were relatively few walk-aways during the 1991 bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The United States Treasury falls into the skeptical camp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The overwhelming bulk of people who have negative equity stay in their homes and keep paying,'' said Michael S. Barr, assistant Treasury secretary for financial institutions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would cost about $745 billion, slightly more than the size of the original 2008 bank bailout, to restore all underwater borrowers to the point where they were breaking even, according to First American.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using government money to do that would be seen as unfair by many taxpayers, Mr. Barr said. On the other hand, doing nothing about underwater mortgages could encourage more walk-aways, dealing another blow to a fragile economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not an easy area,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Walking away -- also called ''jingle mail,'' because of the notion that homeowners just mail their keys to the bank, setting off foreclosure proceedings -- began in the Southwest during the 1980s oil collapse, though it has never been clear how widespread it was.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the current bust, lenders first noticed something strange after real estate prices had fallen about 10 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An executive with <span class="companylink">Wachovia</span>, one of the country's biggest and most aggressive lenders, said during a conference call in January 2008 that the bank was bewildered by customers who had ''the capacity to pay, but have basically just decided not to.'' (<span class="companylink">Wachovia</span> failed nine months later and was bought by <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>. )</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With prices now down by about 30 percent, underwater borrowers fall into two groups. Some have owned their homes for many years and got in trouble because they used the house as a cash machine. Others, like Mr. Koellmann in Miami Beach, made only one mistake: they bought as the boom was cresting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was April 2006, a moment when the perpetual rise of real estate was considered practically a law of physics. Mr. Koellmann was 23, a management consultant new to Miami.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financially cautious by nature, he bought a small, plain one-bedroom apartment for $215,000, much less than his agent told him he could afford. He put down 20 percent and received a fixed-rate loan from <span class="companylink">Countrywide Financial</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not quite four years later, apartments in the building are selling in foreclosure for $90,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is no financial sense in staying,'' Mr. Koellmann said. With the $1,500 he is paying each month for his mortgage, taxes and insurance, he could rent a nicer place on the beach, one with a gym, security and valet parking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Walking away, he knows, is not without peril. At minimum, it would ruin his credit score. Mr. Koellmann would like to attend graduate school. If an admission dean sees a dismal credit record, would that count against him? How about a new employer?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of all, though, he struggles with the ethical question.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I took a loan on an asset that I didn't see was overvalued,'' he said. ''As much as I would like my bank to pay for that mistake, why should it?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is an attitude Wall Street would like to encourage. David Rosenberg, the chief economist of the investment firm Gluskin Sheff, wrote recently that borrowers were not victims. They ''signed contracts, and as adults should also be held accountable,'' he wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, this is not necessarily how Wall Street itself behaves, as demonstrated by the case of Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village. An investment group led by the real estate giant Tishman Speyer recently defaulted on $4.4 billion in debt that it had used to buy the two apartment developments in Manhattan, handing the properties back to the lenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, during the boom, it was the banks that helped drive prices to unrealistic levels by lowering credit standards and unleashing a wave of speculative housing demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Koellmann applied last fall to <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> for a modification, noting that his income had slipped. But the lender came back a few weeks ago with a plan that added more restrictive terms while keeping the payments about the same.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That may have been the last straw,'' Mr. Koellmann said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Guy D. Cecala, publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance magazine, says he does not hear much sympathy from lenders for their underwater customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The banks tell me that a lot of people who are complaining were the ones who refinanced and took all the equity out any time there was any appreciation,'' he said. ''The banks are damned if they will help.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joe Figliola has heard that message. He bought his house in Elgin, Ill., in 2004, then refinanced twice to get better terms. He pulled out a little money both times to cover the closing costs and other expenses. Now his place is underwater while his salary as circulation manager for the local newspaper has been cut.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RONKONKOMA, N.Y. -- Landlords don't typically expect to set leasing records in a severe economic downturn, but the Long Island industrial real estate market is proving to be a welcome anomaly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a 4.5 percent vacancy rate that is the lowest of any industrial market in the country, Long Island's 6,200 warehouses appear to be weathering the recession handily. Industrial space tends to have a reputation for stability; while unemployed people may not use office space, they still tend to consume. But the strength of Long Island's market has surprised even its longtime real estate watchers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason that leasing has been so successful is that landlords have reduced prices by about 12.3 percent. The average asking rent fell to $9.27 a square foot in the fourth quarter of 2009, from a high of $10.58 a square foot in the second quarter of 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rechler Equity Partners, a property developer based in Melville, N.Y., that has about six million square feet of commercial real estate, signed leases on more than one million square feet of space in 2009, a level not reached very often, even during the boom years from about 2003 to 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's only the third time we've broken the one-million-square-feet mark,'' said Gregg Rechler, a partner with Rechler Equity, a 50-year-old family-run company. ''It's pretty significant, and it definitely exceeded our expectations when we started 2009.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One large deal was the Package All Corporation's lease of 98,000 square feet at 2005 Orville Drive in Ronkonkoma, one of the largest Long Island leasing deals in 2009. Mitchell D. Rechler, Gregg Rechler's cousin and a Rechler partner, said the company had been pricing warehouse space low enough to be attractive. Also, 45 percent of the leases signed by Rechler Equity were renewals, many initiated by tenants taking advantage of the market to renegotiate their leases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, what has buoyed landlords the most has been the relative vitality of the Long Island industrial market, a strength not mirrored by its ravaged office market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I remember my grandfather telling me that historically, in economic declines, industrial real estate was the leading indicator, before office,'' Mitchell Rechler said. ''And in the recession of the late '80s and early '90s, industrial was the first thing hit. That has not been the case this time around.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some real estate experts say Long Island's market has characteristics that help it hold up in severe recessions. Unlike northern New Jersey, which is a national distribution center, Long Island serves mainly the island and New York City, said Aaron Jodka, a senior economist at Property and Portfolio Research, a unit of the CoStar Group, a real estate information company based in Bethesda, Md.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The industrial market on Long Island, with about 170 million square feet of space, is about a third the size of the one in northern New Jersey. Companies on Long Island tend to be local service firms, regional distributors, and light manufacturing and assembly operations, often for industries like pharmaceuticals or cosmetics. Buildings tend to be closer to 50,000 square feet than the warehouses of more than 100,000 square feet seen in national distribution hubs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New Jersey market ''is much weaker now, because it's tied to the national economy,'' Mr. Jodka said, ''so as retailers have slumped, as trade has slumped, northern New Jersey has taken a larger hit.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the economies of Long Island and New York City have also suffered, they have not fared as badly as some other locales. And unlike markets like Atlanta and the Inland Empire in California, Long Island did not experience a rush of new warehouse development before the recession, primarily because of the shortage of developable land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of the stuff that is built on Long Island is geared toward the local distributor, or it's built to suit, so as the space comes online, it's already preleased to a specific tenant,'' Mr. Jodka said. ''That generally helps to keep the market more stable.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asking rents for industrial space on Long Island have been slipping slowly since the second quarter of 2008. By the fourth quarter of 2009, they had fallen to $9.27 a square foot, according to the CoStar Group. Nationally, the average rate for industrial space hovers around $6 a square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The market is certainly slumping as demand is waning,'' Mr. Jodka said of Long Island. ''There's pressure across the board, as there is nationally, but the decline hasn't been as strong as those markets that saw an abundance of new supply.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of building sales has also dropped precipitously, with only 23 Long Island warehouses changing hands in the first nine months of 2009, compared with 60 in the period a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert C. Godfrey, a senior vice president at the real estate company <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>, said: ''That part of the market has slowed more than the leasing part, because of the lack of financing. Financing deals over $5 million or $6 million has gotten very difficult.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long Island will remain sleepy once the recession is over, Mr. Jodka said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a slower, steadier market, less volatility, and that's excellent right now,'' he said. ''But once the national economy starts to rebound, it moves Long Island to sort of the back seat.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The condo in Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif., has three bedrooms, three bathrooms and sweeping ocean views. It can be yours for just under $2.6 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's one catch: If you buy it, you will be able to use it for only 60 days a year and no more than 29 days in a row.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The California Coastal Commission, an agency founded in 1972, wants to ensure public access to the state's 1,100 miles of shoreline. So when <span class="companylink">Lowe Enterprises</span> requested permission to build 50 condominiums, which the company calls casitas, in an oceanfront resort called Terranea in this lush section of southwest Los Angeles County, the commission demanded restrictions. The idea was to keep owners from monopolizing access to the ocean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Peter M. Douglas, executive director of the commission, developers determined that condominiums would be more profitable than hotels. But because the commission's goal is to maximize public access, it imposed restrictions meant to make the condominiums available to the public as rentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers agreed to the restrictions. But that was during a bull market. Now, Mr. Douglas said, developers say that building condos with the restrictions ''turned out to be more trouble than it's worth.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Terranea, the initial offering of units sold out practically overnight in 2006, according to Maureen Megowan, a real estate agent in neighboring Palos Verdes Estates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But ''sold out,'' in this case, means that buyers signed contracts intending to buy. When it was time to close, in mid-2009, the purchasers couldn't get financing. Matt Walker, a senior vice president of Lowe, would not say how many units have closed, only that ''the financing market has changed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Terranea's troubles may not bode well for the Trump SoHo, a 391-unit hotel and condominium building in Manhattan that is expected to open in April. There, owners will be allowed to use their units no more than 120 days a year and no more than 29 consecutive days in any 36-day period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rodrigo Nino, the president of Prodigy Network, which is marketing units at the Trump SoHo, said the use restrictions ''shouldn't be a problem because the buyers are from overseas anyway'' and will use condos as second or third residences. The units are not time shares; they are being sold outright, at prices that start at about $1.2 million for a studio. But they may feel like time shares to buyers, who, after paying those prices, will be told they have to vacate after just under a month. A renter could move in for the rest of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Trump SoHo, the occupancy limits are the result of a zoning dispute. The building is in a manufacturing zone, a designation that allows construction of hotels, but not permanent residences. After the local community board voted against the project, the Bloomberg administration negotiated an agreement to allow the condos, so long as there were residency restrictions that would help create a hotel-like environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The restrictions may be one reason the units failed to sell during an initial offering in 2007. The owners hope the opening of the hotel will revive interest in the building, according to Eve McGrath, a vice president at Rubenstein Public Relations, which represents the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condos built within hotels are nothing new. But in a typical ''condotel'' owners can use their units freely; some units even become primary residences. An owner who isn't in residence can choose to put the unit in a rental pool to bring in income or can keep it empty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Terranea and Trump SoHo, buyers don't have the second option. They are required to allow the hotel to rent their units when they're not in residence (though the owners do get a portion of the rent). The requirements are enforceable, said Eric Glazer, a Florida attorney who often represents condo buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts pointed to half a dozen other condo developments around the country with use restrictions. The Suites at Beaver Creek Lodge, near Vail, Colo., requires owners to make their units available for rental 300 days a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And at the 35-unit Beach Village, on the grounds of the Hotel del Coronado near San Diego, owners are limited to no more than 90 days of occupancy each year (and no more than 25 in any 50-day period). As at Terranea, the restrictions were negotiated with the California Coastal Commission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When units at Beach Village went on the market several years ago, they sold out despite the restrictions. Most of the buyers, according to Ruth Ann Fischer, a real estate agent with an office in the Hotel del Coronado, live elsewhere and use their condos for vacations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Fischer said the occupancy limits were strictly enforced. ''We've turned owners away,'' she said. ''They've called to make reservations, and they couldn't because they've exceeded their time frame.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The upside to the use restrictions is that condo owners can earn rental income. At Terranea, units are available for up to $1,650 a night. The developer retains 50 percent of the rent and pays the rest (less a housekeeping fee) to the owner. That could mean income of as much as $700 a night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the carrying costs on the unit -- including real estate taxes but not including the mortgage or other costs of ownership -- are more than $65,000 a year, according to Ms. Megowan, who with her husband, Bruce, a real estate broker, prepared a detailed analysis of the figures. According to the Megowans, a unit would have to be rented almost 100 nights a year to cover the carrying costs. And that might be difficult at a time when Los Angeles hotels are in a slump. (Average occupancy in 2009 was 64.3 percent, down 9.6 percent from 2008, according to <span class="companylink">Smith Travel Research</span>.) ''There is essentially no return on your money for a long time,'' Ms. Megowan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Walker of <span class="companylink">Lowe Enterprises</span> said in an e-mail message that the company would not comment on financial matters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Terranea is having other problems. Lowe has defaulted on several loans, which has made banks unwilling to lend to buyers of individual units. But the occupancy restrictions won't make selling the units any easier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Megowan said the three-bedroom unit she listed for $2.6 million was not attracting much interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lowe ''may have done the right thing for the top of the market,'' she said, ''but at this point it's not working.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of people preparing to buy a home rose slightly in December, a sign that home sales could be stabilizing heading into the spring buying season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said on Tuesday that its seasonally adjusted index of sales agreements in December rose 1 percent from November, to 96.6 points. That was a little lower than the 97.1 level analysts expected, according to Thomson Reuters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index has risen for nine of the last 10 months as buyers took advantage of an $8,000 first-time homebuyer tax credit before its scheduled expiration Nov. 30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congress extended the tax credit to April 30, and added a $6,500 credit for current homeowners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pending home sales index fell 16 percent from October to November, as activity temporarily died down after the first-time buyer credit was extended. The index is up nearly 11 percent from December 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These swings are masking the underlying trend, which is a broad improvement over year-ago levels,'' said Lawrence Yun, the association's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real estate industry hopes the recovery will continue, and Mike Larson, an analyst with Weiss Research, said the index ''sets the stage for a more positive spring selling season.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the industry has to overcome significant challenges, like high unemployment, rising foreclosures and tight lending standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The result? We'll likely just muddle through instead of witness a V-shaped recovery like those that followed previous housing busts,'' Mr. Larson said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By ELIZABETH A. HARRIS </div><div>2742 words</div><div>31 January 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AS the residential real estate market in New York City continues to emerge from its deep freeze, sales at new condominium developments are starting to pick up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while there are deals to be had on some new condos, buyers must navigate a tricky balance between getting in early -- which often means a better price -- and avoiding plunking down a deposit on a building plagued by bad construction or shaky financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a buyers' market and sponsors are making deals,'' said Jan B. Geller, a real estate lawyer with Altschul Goldstein &amp;Geller. ''But you have to be careful. What seems like a diamond in the rough may be a rhinestone.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not always easy to know how to tell the difference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Alison Archibald and her fiancé, Urosh Perishic, started looking for an apartment to buy last fall, they noticed that some of the buildings they were interested in were eerily dark at night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We were driving around looking at buildings, seeing how many lights were on,'' Mr. Perishic said. ''I don't want to be the only one living there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building they settled on, the 303-unit Oro Condominium at 306 Gold Street in Brooklyn, is 44 percent sold. They bought a two-bedroom two-bath for $740,000. When sales began in the building in 2007, the asking price for that apartment -- on the 33rd floor with views of Manhattan and four bridges -- was $1.075 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We were in a position where we could buy,'' Ms. Archibald said, ''so we realized we should just do it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you decide to do it, too, be sure to do it carefully.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are two major minefields to keep in mind when entering the world of new developments. The first is financial. What happens to your investment if the building doesn't sell out? The second is bricks and mortar. How can you avoid buying in a place that was poorly constructed?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You thought you were buying into this beautiful luxury building that was going to be owned by people of substance, and you wind up in a building owned by a bank or being rented out for extended periods of time,'' said Steven R. Wagner, a real estate lawyer with Wagner Davis. ''This creates problems with financing, refinancing, buying and selling, but it also creates issues in quality of life.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In any housing boom, some buildings are thrown up hastily. The reports of leaks and inadequate fire-stopping in new construction are enough to make any buyer nervous. And if you're considering buying in a building that's still being built, an even more basic question to ask is: Will it ever be finished?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Money</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price paid for a Manhattan apartment in a new development fell to $1.19 million at the end of 2009, from $1.54 million at the end of 2008, a difference of 23 percent, according to Corcoran Sunshine, a brokerage that sells only new developments. There was also a drop in Brooklyn, but it was smaller, down to $585,000 from $630,000, a difference of only 7 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, as prices have come down, mortgages remain mind-numbingly difficult to get, especially for people buying in new developments. Banks are requiring much higher down payments and credit scores than in years past, and they're also evaluating liquidity more strictly in some cases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It used to be you could have a 660 credit score and the bank didn't really care,'' said Melissa Cohn, the president of Manhattan Mortgage, a mortgage brokerage. ''Now they want it to be well over 700.'' She added, ''But one of the bigger issues we're having these days is getting the building approved.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One qualification lenders are sure to look at is what percentage of the building has sold. As more contracts are signed, a greater variety of mortgages become available to buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When a building is 15 percent sold -- sold here means contracts signed -- a tower of steel and glass can legally become a condominium, and deals can start to close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At this stage, few lending institutions will give potential buyers a loan. As a result, many of these early deals are all-cash transactions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initial sales can also be made with the help of portfolio lenders -- so called because they make loans and hold them in a portfolio rather then selling them off. These mortgages tend to be a bit more expensive than standard conforming loans, with interest rates about half a point or a point higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another source for early deals: private banks, which cater to a wealthy clientele. These rarefied buyers must have millions of dollars in liquid assets after the apartment deal goes through.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When a building is 30 percent sold, another financing option comes into play: the developer can apply for the loan program of the Federal Housing Administration. Mortgages insured by the F.H.A. can be granted even to buyers with spotty credit, as long as they have a steady income. These mortgages require as little as a 3.5 percent down payment. They are only for conforming loans, which reach a maximum of $729,750 in New York. There are also some extra fees, which are expected to rise a bit this spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buying in a building that's F.H.A. approved can be a good idea even if you don't need that type of loan, because this extra financing option opens up the buyer pool, possibly creating a brisker sales pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When a building is 50 percent sold, getting a mortgage becomes a little easier and a little cheaper, but options still tend to be limited to portfolio lenders, private banks and F.H.A.-insured loans. The building can try to get a special waiver from the <span class="companylink">Federal National Mortgage Association</span>, or <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, which would open it up to standard retail banks, but that is not always an easy task.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without that waiver, Fannie will guarantee mortgages only in buildings that are at least 70 percent sold. But once the 70 percent mark is reached, the field of financing opens up and just about any bank will lend to the building -- assuming the project has sufficient insurance and reserves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At this point, the screening becomes less about the building and more about the buyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The first 30 or 40 percent of buyers are obviously taking a slightly higher risk than someone buying in a well-developed building,'' said Rolan Shnayder, the director of new development lending at Home Owners Mortgage, a direct lender. ''So sponsors are willing to offer better deals and concessions to those first buyers. Whereas, someone who's waiting until the building is almost sold out, is going to pay full market price.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But not every new building is lowering prices. In some cases it simply can't. Construction loans dictate the lowest price at which an apartment can be sold, and these prices were set years ago in a very different market. Instead of writing down the asset on their balance sheet, some banks would rather the buildings sat empty. This situation may not be sustainable, but for now, some lenders have dug their heels firmly into the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, however, there are deals out there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A condominium in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, called Warehouse 11, is offering low prices to kick-start sales. But the building has a troubled history. It first came to market in 2007, and then a year later, when about 30 percent of the 120 units had sold and the building was almost finished, the bank pulled the plug. The developer gave back all the deposits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We were told the financing wasn't there to complete the building,'' said David Maundrell, the president of aptsandlofts.com, the brokerage handling sales in the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This winter, the developer worked out a deal with its bank, <span class="companylink">Capital One</span>, to keep ownership of the property, and then put the apartments back on the market at a steep discount. Some units start at $450 per square foot, about $300 less than their average contract prices three years ago. In its first two week back on the market this month, Warehouse 11 had 35 signed contracts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You start at a reasonable number and move your way up,'' Mr. Maundrell said of prices. ''You need a certain threshold, not just for financing, but because people need to be comfortable that the building is selling well.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The longer you wait for a building to sell, the less risk there is that you'll be at the mercy of the sponsor for years. If the sponsor controls the board, he or she may decide to do upkeep on the cheap. If the sponsor decides to rent out the building's unsold apartments, that means you've suddenly invested in a rental building where turnover is high and apartments often take a beating. Another grim possibility is that the sponsor could default, which might send the building into the arms of a bank and then off to some unknown entity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Building</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Two years ago, it was completely different,'' said Tom Le, a senior vice president of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>. ''Buyers were walking through a building that was not even completed yet -- like there were no walls -- and there were multiple offers on any unit. These days, most people want to see a complete product.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers who sign before construction is completed have always taken a risk that the building won't look quite the way they imagined it. But these days, the biggest hazard of the preoccupancy purchase is that the building will lose its construction financing and then languish unfinished, wrapped in tarps -- and wallpapered with your down payment -- for an indefinite period of time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you are determined to buy in an unfinished building, research the construction lender. Many commercial banks are still on shaky footing. See if there has been any coverage in the media about the bank's solvency. You can also try looking it up on the Web site of the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>; go to the Enforcement Decisions and Orders page, look up your state, and see if any actions have been taken against that bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even playing it safe and waiting until a building is completed to put down a deposit is not without its pitfalls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's always an inherent risk when buying new construction,'' said Aaron Shmulewitz, a real estate lawyer at Belkin Burden Wenig &amp;Goldman. ''There is no track record for that building.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first thing you should do when considering a building is to give a close read to the condominium offering plan, a description of the project filed with the state attorney general's office. If the brochures and brokers promise amenities that aren't up and running, make sure the plan explicitly mentions them; if it doesn't, the finished product does not have to offer them. If the building is complete, walk through it and make sure it delivers on the plan's promises.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reading the plan is just a start.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before you sign a contract, ask the real estate broker if you can bring in an engineer or inspector to look the place over. Many sponsors won't let your expert poke around on the roof, but you should be able to get one into the apartment you wish to buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other factors that speak to the structural integrity of the building are complaints and litigation. You can look up an address on the Department of Buildings Web site and check for violations. You can also inspect court documents to see if the sponsor has been sued in connection with the project and what the judgment was. This can be done online at court Web sites or through a search engine like LexisNexis, though you might want to ask a lawyer for help to be sure you don't miss anything.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the best ways to find out about any major problems is to ask the building's residents. Stand outside and talk to people coming and going. Ask what it's like to live there. If there have been problems, ask how the sponsor handled them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Developer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If a building has been standing for a only few months, there's very little history to judge from, so the reputation of the developer becomes extremely important.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are some developers who have excellent reputations, do excellent construction and are well funded -- and there are some buildings I wouldn't buy in if you paid for it,'' Mr. Wagner of Wagner Davis said. ''So would I buy? Yes. But I would be very careful.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wayne Hosang recently bought a three-bedroom apartment at 80 Metropolitan in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. He says he was reassured by the fact that the developer, Steiner NYC, had completed many other projects, even though they have all been commercial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In a boom, anyone with two dollars and an idea can build a building,'' Mr. Hosang said. ''I can do anything to the inside of the apartment. What I can't fix is what's on the outside.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To start researching the developer, take a look at the offering plan. It will tell you the name of the organization as well as the individuals behind it, who are called principals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do a litigation search for the principals as well as the organization -- some developers create a different corporate entity, often using the building's address, for each project. Look the developer up in newspapers and on real estate blogs. You might also try the Better Business Bureau to see if anybody has lodged a complaint.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Find out what other buildings he or she has built. Search for lawsuits and violations on those properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You might find out if the developer has other buildings on the market -- look on his or her Web site, do some Web searches, ask around. Too much inventory for sale may put a developer under a financial strain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultimately, no matter how much research you do, there are some things you just cannot know until you live there and until the last apartment in the building sells.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The longer you wait, the safer it is,'' said Mr. Shmulewitz of Belkin Burden Wenig &amp;Goldman. ''And if you wait a really, really long time, it becomes a prewar building.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Look Before You Leap</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BUYING a condominium in a new building these days means balancing the risks and benefits. Here are some things to keep in mind and questions to ask before you sign a contract:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Be wary of buildings that have big blocks of apartments owned by investors. If a single entity owns, say, 20 percent of the building and cannot pay the common charge, the residents may have to make up the difference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If possible, get a mortgage contingency written into the contract. That way, if you can't get financing, you can get your deposit back. If there is a long lag between the signing of the contract and the closing of the deal, this can be difficult to get. If the building is in move-in condition and ready to close, you might have better luck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If construction halted as the building was going up, it's important to ask when and why. The building might have sat open, exposed to the elements for months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before you close, walk through the apartment, ideally with an engineer or inspector, and make sure everything is in good working order. Try out all the faucets and the appliances, open and close all doors and windows. If there's a fireplace, test it to make sure it vents.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHEN money grew on trees during the late great credit boom, private equity firms plunged headlong into New York City real estate. Not only did these companies snag dazzling Manhattan office towers, they also paid up for thousands of mundane rental apartments across the five boroughs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sure, they had taken on monumental debt to buy these properties, but they had a potent strategy. If they were able to jack up the apartments' rents, even on those that had much lower, regulated rates, they'd have no trouble profiting mightily.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most famous such bet was the $6.3 billion purchase in 2006 of Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village on the East River in Manhattan. The buyer was a partnership that Tishman Speyer Properties and BlackRock Realty oversaw. But last week, the properties -- now valued at less than $2 billion -- went back to the banks that had financed this top-of-the-market deal. The investors in the project had defaulted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stuyvesant Town is a high-profile deal, to be sure. But there were many others like it in the mania, struck by lesser-known companies with private equity backing. They bought rent-regulated apartments in Manhattan, Queens and the Bronx. Some of these deals are now vulnerable, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the transactions took place several years ago, private equity chiefs were riding high. Loading debt onto the companies they bought, managers dismissed workers, cut customer services and sold off assets to pay themselves and their investors and to meet their debt payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The private equity firms took a similar approach to rental apartments. But instead of dumping workers, they hoped to jettison low-revenue renters so their units could be renovated and leased out at much higher prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private equity firms have financed the purchase of 100,000 units of rent-regulated housing across New York City since 2005, according to the Association for Neighborhood and Housing Development, a coalition of nonprofit housing groups in New York. These owners account for almost 10 percent of the city's rent-regulated housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">UNDER pressure to turn over apartments to meet their financial obligations, some of these properties' managers have run roughshod over tenants and the regulations intended to protect them. Last fall, for example, New York State's highest court ruled that Stuyvesant Town's owners had improperly raised rents on 4,400 apartments in the complexes, forcing the rents to be rolled back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, Andrew M. Cuomo, the New York attorney general, said he was preparing to sue Vantage Properties, a private-equity-backed owner of 9,500 mostly rent-regulated apartments in working-class neighborhoods across New York City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a letter warning Vantage of impending litigation, Mr. Cuomo's office contended that Vantage, which has bought more than 125 buildings in Queens, Harlem and other areas since 2006, had engaged in a ''systemic pattern of harassment'' to generate significant tenant turnover. Increasing turnover was central to Vantage's business strategy, the attorney general's office said, so that it could charge much higher rents after renovating the newly vacant apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Vantage's ability to satisfy its projected profits largely depends on its ability to evict rent-regulated tenants and raise rents to market levels,'' wrote Alphonso B. David, chief of the Civil Rights Bureau in the attorney general's office, in a letter to the company last week. Vantage tried to force out long-term tenants ''by serving baseless legal notices and commencing frivolous housing court eviction proceedings,'' he wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokesman for Vantage and for Neil L. Rubler, its president, said the company was ''genuinely committed to serving its residents and to the future of affordable housing in New York City.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We look forward to demonstrating this to the attorney general,'' the spokesman added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They will have to work hard. According to Mr. David's letter, Vantage routinely tried to evict tenants by sending them notices that their leases were not being renewed. Vantage justified the letters, known as Golub notices, with phony claims, like contending that the tenants didn't have the right to live in the rent-regulated apartments, Mr. David's letter said. In the company's business plans and annual reports to its investors, the attorney general's office said, Vantage even named its business model the ''Golub program.'' One of the company's business plans said that its ''legal efforts are starting to bear fruit and rent prices continue to exceed plan, all contributing to what should be a strong year to come.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN a 2007 regulatory filing, Vantage had a different name for its model. Calling it a ''recapturing'' strategy, Vantage said it expected to turn over 20 percent to 30 percent of units in a property during its first year of ownership -- a rate five times the norm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One Vantage tenant cited in the attorney general's letter had lived in his apartment without incident for 14 years. After Vantage bought his building, the company put the tenant through three unfounded eviction proceedings in one year, the attorney general's office said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, it said, Vantage improperly claimed that his rent was delinquent, then incorrectly contended that he had another primary residence, which is not permitted for those living in rent-regulated apartments. Finally, it said, Vantage made another baseless claim that he hadn't paid his rent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of this surprises Benjamin Dulchin, executive director of the Association for Neighborhood and Housing Development. He says that harassment is central to rental real estate investments backed by private equity firms because the onerous debt they have taken on requires significantly higher revenue than can be generated in rent-regulated buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, he argues, even if these properties go into bankruptcy, the pattern of harassment may continue. Distressed-debt investors interested in buying them may continue trying to force out tenants, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Vulture funds are lining up to buy the debt at what is still a speculative price,'' he added. ''The question is, will they recognize that in a rent-regulated building, you need to pay a price that the current tenants can support? Paying any more eventually leads you to a business model that is based on harassment, as the attorney general's action has shown.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bullying as a business model? Unfortunately, it seems to work all too often.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HUNTINGTON</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ON an Island awash with traditional colonials and Capes, Thomas Mojo and Mark Stumer, partners in a design firm, build architecturally unusual contemporary homes -- like the 2007 Maurer house, with its bands of dark wood, glass walls, black stone and smooth white finishes that they put up on a narrow lot near the water in Kings Point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The people who come to us to build contemporary homes are rebels,'' said Mr. Mojo, whose company, Mojo Stumer Associates, also does its share of the conventional. ''Everybody else has the same type of home; they are all traditional homes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clients debate whether to follow the herd, he added, imagining aloud their internal debate:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'' 'If I build contemporary, what are my friends going to think?' It takes a bit of chutzpah to say, 'I am going to buck the trend.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, judging from most residential architecture on the Island, developers here since the midcentury period have not exactly seen their clientele as ''rebel'' material. Despite the overall influence of Modernism, economic forces kept it from becoming a major part of the landscape as suburbia grew. Of the Modern and contemporary homes on the Island, most are custom built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of which has deterred the Heckscher Museum of Art in finding examples to highlight for ''Arcadia/Suburbia: Architecture on Long Island, 1930-2010,'' a new exhibit that runs through April 11. Maurer House is among the most recent of the 28 modern homes and 23 architects featured in the exhibit, curated by Dr. Erik Neil, an architectural historian -- who found the Island's role as an early setting for important Modernist homes a motivating factor in mounting the show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1937, on a relatively small lot in Great Neck Estates, Frank Lloyd Wright used cypress, brick and red tile on the Rebhuhn house. In 1938 in Old Westbury, Edward Durell Stone, the architect of the first Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan, built the Goodyear House, a weekend retreat with curving walls, a flat roofline and large expanses of glass. In 1951 in Lloyd Neck, Marcel Breuer created the Hanson House, using a butterfly roof and fieldstone. And in 1956 in Lloyd Harbor, Philip Johnson built the Leonhardt House, its glassed-in public living areas seeming almost open to Long Island Sound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The good architecture has a kind of timeless quality to it,'' Dr. Neil said. ''Across the board these architects are much more sensitive to the site, to the landscape and nature.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Modernist style, including homes built in the 1930s, '40s and '50s, ''makes living easier,'' he said. Space flows; glass is used in abundance. ''It is remarkable how uncluttered it is; it is clean, often brighter,'' he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Architects who specialize in Modern design describe a resurgence of attention to its values and aesthetics. Joseph Tanney, a principal at Resolution: 4, a 20-year-old architectural firm in Manhattan, said he had seen ''a rise in Modern design interest and awareness.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Modernism is often considered cold and stark and not necessarily domestic,'' Mr. Tanney said. ''When people get a chance to see examples of Modern domestic architecture done well, people warm up to it quickly and perceptions change.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Michael and Victoria Longworth were considering tearing down their Lido Beach bungalow and building a larger home, ''they weren't particularly married to a Modern look,'' said Mr. Longworth, a Web designer. But after studying Resolution: 4's Modern modular designs, they changed their minds. As Mr. Longworth put it, ''The clean lines and look, the wood, the cedar, it just felt right and looked right in the neighborhood,'' a beach community -- even though most of the surrounding homes are more traditional Capes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He described their new 2,600-square-foot five-bedroom three-bath home, completed last July and featured in digital renderings at the Heckscher exhibit, as ''very stylized,'' with the living spaces on the top floor and a roof deck to take advantage of the ocean views. The bedrooms are downstairs. ''This was a way to stand out but not be ridiculous,'' Mr. Longworth said. ''It's very rectangular but doesn't feel boxy or look boxy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Old Westbury recently, Marc Spector, a principal with the Spector Group, built a ''Modern Prairie-style'' home that incorporated the ''very clean modern lines and warmth of Frank Lloyd Wright's architecture.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Spector says the home was designed in response to a ''drive toward a much cleaner contemporary home'' that is ''less rigid, more transitional'' than purely Modernist homes, with their extended cantilevered rooflines, and extensive use of natural stone, mahogany and glass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contemporary homes cost 10 to 15 percent more to build, he said, partly because ''there is no room for error; the construction has to be perfect; you can't hide anything behind a base molding or a crown molding.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Bentel, who with his brother, Peter, heads Bentel &amp;Bentel, a second-generation Lattingtown architectural firm, acknowledged that ''contemporary still seems to be a special taste.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of those who originally built Modernist homes on the Island, he said, ''regarded themselves as pioneers,'' whereas most home buyers, far from seeing themselves as such, simply ''want to be safe -- they want to come home from work and be comfortable.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not uncommon in his Locust Valley neighborhood, Mr. Bentel said, for Modern homes built in the 1950s and 1960s to be torn down in favor of traditional homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But on the other hand, he pointed out, those traditional exteriors may belie what's inside. He described the ''ethos of Modernism'' as having changed the look of interiors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As evidence he cited the increasing popularity of multipurpose open floor plans. The great room incorporating the kitchen, instead of enclosed and self-contained, pays homage to what he calls the ''spirit of Modernism.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHEN prices fall far enough, buyers will appear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That seems to have been the story of the American housing market in 2009. The number of existing homes that changed hands in 2009 -- 4.6 million -- was up 5 percent from the previous year. It was the first annual increase since 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But to accomplish that, prices had to be cut sharply. The median sales price was $173,200, compared with $196,600 in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adjusted for inflation, that price was the lowest since 1997. As the accompanying chart shows, not since 2005 has the price of the median existing home risen in real dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For those four years, the inflation-adjusted price has fallen 28 percent, something few homeowners thought possible before it happened. They were more used to the previous four years, when the median price outstripped inflation by a total of 27 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase in sales was not only because of rising demand. Foreclosures forced many people out of homes, despite government efforts to get banks to restructure mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes continued to sink, even with help from a tax credit for new homebuyers. For the year, just 373,000 new single-family homes were sold, the lowest total since the government began keeping count in 1963.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That appears to have been caused, as much as anything, by the excess supply of such homes. It is taking a long time to work that off, and in some communities it may never be worked off, as foreclosures and partly built homes make some neighborhoods unattractive for all but the most desperate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales have always been volatile, rising when the economy is strong and interest rates are low, and declining when one or both of those factors are absent. But those ups and downs tended to balance out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over every 10-year period from the 1960s to the late 1990s, annual sales of new homes averaged from about 540,000 homes to 650,000 homes. But after that, the figure began to climb steadily. The recession of 2001 hardly made a dent in sales, as the Federal Reserve slashed interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10-year average peaked in 2006 at 995,000 homes. Even after the disastrous performance in 2009, the 10-year figure is still over 900,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices of new homes have come down as well as those of existing homes, but not as rapidly. That, too, may have held sales back. Adjusted for inflation, the median price of a new home in 2009 was 18 percent below the 2005 figure, compared with the 28 percent drop for existing home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of completed but unsold new homes ended 2009 at 99,000. That is half the peak level reached in early 2008, but many of those homes no longer look new. On average, it has been more than 13 months since they were completed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the accompanying charts, there may be hope to be found from the early 1980s, when the plunge in sales was comparable to this one. When the economy finally picked up, home sales skyrocketed from pent-up demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps that will happen again. The big difference, however, is in prices. While inflation-adjusted prices declined during that downturn, high inflation meant that nominal prices did not. Unlike now, few homeowners owed more than their houses were worth. That is why some economists think a way must be found to reduce the amounts owed by some homeowners.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">State Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo announced Thursday that he intends to sue a major New York landlord that he says harassed hundreds of tenants in rent-regulated apartments in Queens and Manhattan in a systematic effort to force their departure to create vacancies for higher-paying tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The landlord, Vantage Properties, routinely filed eviction notices and other legal actions against working-class and immigrant families in tenements that the company had recently acquired to generate ''substantial tenant turnover,'' investigators and tenant advocates said. But most of the legal notices, the attorney general said in a letter to Vantage, contained ''deceptive and misleading representations.'' Investigators said the majority of those notices were eventually rejected by the city's housing courts, although the company denied that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The attorney general notified Neil Rubler, president of Vantage Properties, that his office would file a lawsuit in five days unless the company stopped the harassment, paid damages to tenants and agreed to a monitor to oversee its future rental activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Landlords who illegally harass tenants to boost their bottom line do great harm to the fabric of the city,'' Mr. Cuomo said. ''Their underhanded tactics displace longtime residents from their homes and exacerbate the acute affordable-housing shortage.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vantage issued a statement Thursday evening saying it looked forward to demonstrating to Mr. Cuomo its commitment ''to serving its residents and to the future of affordable housing in New York City.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But its financial partner, <span class="companylink">Apollo Real Estate Advisors</span>, also issued a statement expressing regret that Vantage had not yet reached an agreement with the attorney general ''incorporating best practices and other tenant protections, which we fully support.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We expect that Vantage will work with Attorney General Cuomo's office to get this matter resolved quickly,'' Apollo said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marina Materon, 63, a cleaning woman who has lived in the same four-story building in Sunnyside, Queens, for 26 years, said Vantage had been harassing her since it bought the building in January 2008. She said she had to go to court to resolve a false claim that she owed back rent, but still regularly receives notices demanding back rent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's harassment,'' she said during an interview at her home, ''because I'm paying my rent and every month they're sending me this thing that says I have to pay this amount. I don't know what I would do if I had to move.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Materon, who pays $754.70 per month for her two-bedroom apartment, said her building is deteriorating. There are rats and cockroaches; the front door is broken and sometimes stays open at night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A relative newcomer, Vantage spent more than $2 billion at the height of the market in 2006 and 2007, buying about 125 buildings with more than 9,500 apartments in Queens, Washington Heights and Harlem. Most often, it did so in partnership with Apollo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vantage, like the Pinnacle Group, the Praedium Group and other private equity firms, paid top dollar for rent-regulated buildings in working-class neighborhoods and wrapped them in inordinately large mortgages. Although rental income did not cover their mortgage payments, their business plan was to profit by forcing out tenants in rent-regulated apartments, renovating the units and sharply increasing rents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, after Vantage and Apollo bought eight buildings in Washington Heights, rental income covered only 40 percent of the annual loan payments. Only one of the 455 apartments was not regulated. But Vantage expected quick turnover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The borrower anticipates to recapture approximately 20 to 30 percent of the units by year end 2008, and 10 percent per year thereafter,'' according to a 2007 corporate filing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the average annual turnover in a rental building in New York is closer to 5 percent. The attorney general and tenant advocates said the only way that Vantage could achieve those numbers was by harassing tenants with fake eviction notices and other tactics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Wall Street type of competition and profit seeking of private equity financing is causing an epidemic of tenant harassment,'' said Benjamin Dulchin, executive director of the Association of Neighborhood Housing. ''Vantage and their financiers are jeopardizing economic diversity and long-term stability of our neighborhoods.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vantage claimed that it was only trying to weed out those tenants who did not qualify for rent regulation. But investigators point out that 86.2 percent of the termination notices filed by Vantage at one complex, Savoy Park in Harlem, were resolved in favor of the tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marcos Oliveira said he never had a landlord problem before Vantage bought his building in Jackson Heights, Queens. Vantage sent him a letter saying that he and his family had to leave because the apartment was not his primary residence. He said he gathered up years of bills from Con Ed and other vendors to prove that he was a longtime resident. But Vantage, he said, refused to cash his rent checks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I couldn't believe it,'' Mr. Oliveira said. ''How come I've been here so long with no problem? Everyone in the building knows me. What do I have to do to get them to leave my family alone?''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo readies his candidacy for governor, one industry is helping him amass a huge fund-raising advantage: real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New records show that even as the industry has confronted its worst crisis in decades, developers, construction executives and real estate lobbyists have given millions of dollars to Mr. Cuomo, providing one in every five dollars over the past six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The money has come as Mr. Cuomo's office has been flooded with complaints about construction in new developments, especially from buyers who are trying to break their sales contracts, claiming that builders are not living up to their promises.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An analysis by The New York Times shows that the real estate industry was the top giver to Mr. Cuomo over the past three years as he amassed $18 million, leaving him with a five-to-one advantage over Gov. David A. Paterson, a fellow Democrat. The donors include some of the biggest names in the business, many of whom are grappling with intense pressures in the current slowdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since June, the top three executives of Tishman Speyer Properties -- Jerry I. Speyer; his wife, Katherine G. Farley; and his son Robert Speyer -- have donated a combined $151,000 to Mr. Cuomo as they struggled to avoid defaulting on the Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village apartment complexes, efforts that eventually failed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shaya Boymelgreen, who built more than 2,400 apartments throughout the city during the building boom over the past decade, gave $8,000 while his empire was unraveling as he struggled to build several projects. Kent Swig, who built a $3 billion real estate portfolio but now says he faces personal bankruptcy, gave $15,000 over the past two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other prominent givers included Lloyd Goldman, an owner of the World Trade Center site; Bruce C. Ratner, the Atlantic Yards developer; Steven Roth, the chief of <span class="companylink">Vornado Realty Trust</span>; Stephen M. Ross, the chief of the Related Companies; and Richard Lefrak, whose family developed Lefrak City in Queens and owns tens of thousands of apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Cuomo got a ton of money from people working in the real estate sector,'' said Bill Mahoney, research coordinator for the New York Public Interest Research Group, a government watchdog organization, who helped analyze the data. ''You don't usually see numbers that high coming from one business sector to one particular candidate, especially as someone who raises as much money as he did. It's definitely not the norm.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past six months, Mr. Cuomo raised $6.8 million, 17 percent of which came from the real estate industry. The industry accounted for 20 percent of his $3.9 million in donations from individuals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The outpouring of support is in some ways unsurprising. Although he has not officially declared his candidacy, Mr. Cuomo is viewed as all but certain to enter the race for governor, and polls indicate he would be a formidable candidate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The donations could create thorny issues for Mr. Cuomo as he pursues the governor's office. Many of the major developers' projects, like the World Trade Center and Atlantic Yards, are likely to come before the next governor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in his role as attorney general, Mr. Cuomo has responsibility over the offering plans of condominium and cooperative apartments, real estate investments, mortgage fraud cases and complaints about construction flaws that violate what developers originally promised. Nearly all plans for new residential development must be approved through his office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aides to Mr. Cuomo said he had set up a rigorous screening process that requires donors to certify that they have had no matter before his office for the past three months. They say he keeps a firewall between his campaign and the operation of his office, and goes further than any other state official in vetting contributors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokesman for Mr. Cuomo's office attributed the financial support from the real estate industry to Mr. Cuomo's work in real estate before his election in 2006. (He worked at the Island Capital Group, a real estate investment fund and developer of luxury marinas.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Any suggestion that members of the real estate industry exert improper influence over this office's real estate finance unit is laughable and belied by the facts,'' said the spokesman, John Milgrim. ''The bureau is staffed with professionals of the highest caliber and integrity, and the bureau itself is a model for other regulators.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some lawyers representing clients in cases involving construction problems with new condo developments and contract troubles say it is extremely difficult to get Mr. Cuomo's office to respond to the problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late 2006, residents at the Newswalk building in Brooklyn, a Boymelgreen project, contacted the attorney general's office about construction problems, said Michael Rogers, a resident and board member. On March 26, 2007, the residents' lawyer wrote a letter to Mr. Cuomo with specific complaints. His office took no action, and the residents sued the developer in November 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July 2008, they filed a formal complaint with the attorney general. For almost a year, they received no response, and in the summer of 2009, Lewis A. Polishook, an assistant attorney general, told the residents that the office would not get involved in a dispute that was in litigation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They've told us, 'You're on your own,' '' Mr. Rogers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cuomo accepted three donations totaling $8,000 from Boymelgreen-related companies between Jan. 15, 2008, and May 11, 2009. After an inquiry from The Times, Mr. Milgrim said that Mr. Cuomo would return the money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cuomo's aides strongly defended the work of the Real Estate Finance Bureau, which handles the complaints, and said Mr. Cuomo had increased its staffing by 23 percent since taking office, making it larger even than the Division of Economic Justice, which oversees Wall Street and consumer problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the challenge is that many buyers are seeking to break contracts on properties that have plunged in value since the real estate bubble burst. That has left the attorney general's office wading through thousands of complaints trying to sort the legitimate from the rest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the 1,640 complaints and 473 escrow dispute cases the bureau received last year, it resolved almost 1,500 complaints and nearly 300 escrow disputes, Mr. Milgrim said. Full investigations were opened in about 150 matters, and the office resolved 50. Ten were resolved through litigation or a settlement, and the rest were addressed through mediation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lorraine Nadel, a real estate lawyer who made a small donation to Mr. Cuomo in the past, said that she received many complaints from New Yorkers who wanted her to contact the attorney general about getting out of condo contracts, and that she tried not to bother the office with most of them. But she sought its help on a recent case involving a developer of a luxury condominium project in Union Square who she said misrepresented the number of signed contracts he had obtained from buyers when he received approval from the attorney general to go ahead with his plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She got no resolution. ''They're sort of the gatekeeper of condo and co-op offering plans,'' she said. ''Now that we are all filing complaints, they really need to step in and resolve it, and they're not.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Milgrim, the aide to Mr. Cuomo, said the office reviewed the case and found no fraud.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cuomo declined to be interviewed for this article. The issues facing the real estate bureau do not seem to be affecting the office's civil rights division, which handles some mortgage fraud cases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meghan Faux, director of the foreclosure prevention project at South Brooklyn Legal Services, praised what she called the newfound responsiveness of the civil rights division. And James Lewis, director of policy and organizing at Changer, a nonprofit group that counsels homeowners, said that when he approached the office last spring about foreclosure rescue scams, the staff met with him immediately and resolved the problem in the summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't think we could have wished for any more,'' he said.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Securitization Went Awry Once Before</span>
</div><div class="author">By FLOYD NORRIS </div><div>1385 words</div><div>29 January 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate securitization was one of the great innovations in finance in the last quarter-century. In an unprecedented way, it allowed vast sums of money to go into the real estate market from people who traditionally did not take part in it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the people making the loans did not need to worry if they would be repaid, and in the end the entire edifice collapsed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, with the securitization market nearly dead, getting that market going again is vital to providing Americans with mortgage loans. Securitization may need to be reformed a little, but it remains critically important to a well-functioning economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is the conventional wisdom now, at least among many bankers and economists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of it is right, except that ''unprecedented'' part. Although few people now remember it, another wave of private securitizations once altered the real estate landscape, particularly in New York but also in Chicago and some other American cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That wave ended pretty much like this one did.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That fact should raise questions about whether the securitization machine should be patched up and back in business to operate without government guarantees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps, instead, we should find a way to get banks and other long-term investors, like insurance companies, to make -- and keep -- most of the real estate loans that are needed in society.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The original wave of securitizations took place in the 1920s, when the United States went on the greatest building boom ever. Many investors saw how rapidly real estate prices were rising and wanted in on the action. The builders and brokers were only too happy to oblige.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, the securitizations were not as complex as the ones invented in recent years, but they were not all simple either. Most were bonds backed by one commercial building whose construction was being financed, but there were also pools of residential mortgages. Some of the bonds included warrants for partial ownership of the building, and some were convertible into stock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was even something similar to the exotic C.D.O.'s, or collateralized debt obligations, that failed so spectacularly. Those securities were not directly backed by real estate, but were instead supported by other securities that had such backing. One 1920s bond was called a ''collateral trust'' security, with a claim on a building's profits but not on the building itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Easily obtainable financing via public capital markets corresponded with an urban construction boom,'' reported William N. Goetzmann and Frank Newman in a paper just released by the National Bureau of Economic Research, titled ''Securitization in the 1920s.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Regulation and centralization were glaringly absent,'' they add. ''Ultimately the size, scope and complexity of the 1920s real estate market undermined its merits, causing a crash not unlike the one underpinning our current financial crisis.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the lessons of that boom and bust have largely been ignored. Everyone remembers the 1920s and the stock market crash of 1929, but there has been little data collected on what happened to real estate securities or even on how large a market it was. It turns out that real estate securities constituted a major market, and began to falter before stocks did.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The breakdown in their valuation, through the mechanism of the collateral cycle, may have led to the subsequent stock market crash of 1929-30,'' they wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Ben Bernanke had been thinking of that, do you think he might have been more hesitant to say that the subprime mortgage crisis had been ''contained'' in 2007?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The paper by Professor Goetzmann, the director of the International Center for Finance at Yale University's School of Management, and Mr. Newman, a former Yale student who is now an analyst for the hedge fund Protege Partners, appears to be the first to delve into the available data, which Mr. Newman had to dig up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Professor Goetzmann, who teaches both real estate finance and financial history, said he grew interested in the subject after coming across old real estate bonds and wondering what the story was behind them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The story, it turns out, is one intrinsic to the New York skyline. From 1929 through 1931, according to data compiled by Mr. Newman, 128 buildings that were 70 or more meters in height, or about 230 feet, were completed in New York City. That was the most ever.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the last three years, 2007 through 2009, the figure was 87. That was the highest number in nearly 30 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is notable that the record construction period continued for two years after the Depression had begun, just as cranes dotted the New York skyline last year even as the worst recession since World War II went into its second year. Big buildings take time to plan and to build. Once begun, the best course may be to finish, even if the economy offers little hope for leasing out the space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, those who say securitization is necessary to get the economy moving again argue that the process brings together investors and those with the capacity to make loans, and that banks simply do not have enough capital to make the needed loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was pretty much the same story in the 1920s, Professor Goetzmann and Mr. Newman reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate bond firms ''generally served simultaneously as originators, underwriters and distributors,'' they wrote. ''Performing these three functions proved incredibly lucrative in an optimistic real estate market. So long as investors were easy to locate, bond houses could collect substantial fees for these services without having to part with much, or any, of their own capital.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So it was for Wall Street firms that snapped up mortgage lenders earlier in the last decade. Among the biggest in mortgage origination, underwriting and distribution were <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> and <span class="companylink">Bear Stearns</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A major difference between then and now is that most of the real estate securities issued in the 1920s went to build structures, many of which still stand and provide housing or employment. A much greater proportion of real estate securitizations in the last decade went to help people buy existing buildings, an activity that left behind no such legacy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the buildings financed with bonds was the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, whose bonds were issued on Sept. 1, 1929, about as bad a piece of market timing for the buyers as can be imagined. The bonds held their own for a few months, but plunged before the hotel opened in 1931.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1942, Conrad Hilton began buying up the Waldorf bonds for less than 5 cents on the dollar and was, he recalled in his memoir, ''Be My Guest,'' deemed to be the kind of sucker who might buy the Brooklyn Bridge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In New York, hotels are dead,'' a real estate broker told Hilton. ''There are too many of them.'' Hilton kept buying the bonds, and eventually took over the Waldorf. It was a much better investment for him than it had been for the original bond investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If economists and regulators had recalled the securitizations of the 1920s, they might have realized that the recent boom in real estate securitizations was not what they took it to be: a result of American financial ingenuity that created ways to spread risk to those who could best afford to bear it and in the process made financing more available and less expensive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was, instead, the same old speculative enthusiasm, even if it was wearing fancy new clothes. Investors who had seen real estate prices rise thought that trend could not end. Wall Street sharpies thought they had found a way to make lots of money while not bearing the ultimate risk if the game suddenly ended.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As it turned out, the sharpies were wrong. They too got swept up in the carnage -- just as their predecessors had in the 1930s.</p>

</div><div class="author">By IRENE RAWLINGS  </div><div>1490 words</div><div>29 January 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>28</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article in the Escapes pages last Friday about purchases of vacation homes in various ski areas in the United States, including Telluride, Colo., misstated the origin of the name of Element 52, a condominium project under construction in Telluride. It is named for the element tellurium, No. 52 on the periodic table -- not for ''telluridium, a form of gold ore.'' (There is no ore of that name.) The article also referred incorrectly to the mining of gold ore. It was not mined in Telluride.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Fri Feb 05 2010</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DENVER -- OVER the holiday season all was snowy and bright at ski areas across the country, with a festive jingle in the air. It wasn't sleigh bells -- it was the sound of money. Vacation-home seekers who saw recessionary opportunities were looking to buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many were ready to pay in cash, and they wanted great deals, like a $900,000 slope-side condominium for $500,000 or a studio in town for half the asking price. They were getting what they wanted because it is the best buyers' market in 20 years, real estate agents said, with inventory at levels not seen since 2001.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Eldridge, 59, a lawyer, and his wife, Amelia, 58, of Fayetteville, Ark., have a lot of affection for Snowmass, Colo. They learned to ski there with their families in the 1970s. They were married there and bought a small condo so they could visit often. Two children and several grandchildren later, they are looking to move up to a three-bedroom condo. After looking at more than 10 units during their annual holiday visit to Snowmass in December, they decided to wait until January to make an offer of $700,000 on a three-bedroom ski-in, ski-out condo that was listed at more than $1 million just last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're seeing a number of price reductions as sellers get more realistic,'' said Ms. Eldridge, who has been a real estate agent for 30 years and is well acquainted with the vagaries of the market. ''Time has caused some sellers to accept offers that they may have rejected before.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As an example of those low prices Andrew Ernemann, a broker at B. J. Adams &amp;Company, which has offices in Aspen and Snowmass, said there was a studio just a few blocks from the Aspen gondola listed at $275,000. Just a few years ago the asking price would have been upward of $350,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If prices are flat or still falling, the number of sales seems to be increasing, real estate offices across the West said. Patti Brave, a broker in the Cordillera office of Slifer, Smith &amp;Frampton in the Vail Valley in Colorado, said that the first seven months of 2009 were dismal, but that the rising stock market had helped drive up sales, though prices at Vail and Beaver Creek are still off by 10 percent or more in the last three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Telluride, the historic Colorado mining town tucked in the end of a valley in the remote San Juan Mountains, remains a bright spot for sellers, agents there say. Steve Finger, owner of Finbro Construction and Development, is building Element 52, a 200,000-square-foot, 32-unit luxury condo project overlooking town. The development, which is more than 60 percent sold, is named for telluridium, a form of gold ore mined here in the 19th century.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with mortgage rates holding at around 4 percent for qualified buyers, cash deals are king right now, brokers say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Jackson, Wyo., ''buyers are paying cash and determining the market,'' said Greg Prugh, a broker, who said prices have fallen by as much as 50 percent since 2007. He recently sold a two-bedroom condo in Teton Village listed at $700,000 for $360,000 in cash. ''Modern-day Jackson was built on construction, financing and real estate,'' he said. ''With financing tight, those jobs are gone, and the middle-class people who bought condos on spec are forced to sell.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The huge price cuts seem to be bringing in more traffic, brokers say. ''Phones are ringing and people are walking into our offices again,'' said Martha Johnson, president of Rivers to Peaks Big Sky Real Estate in Big Sky, Mont. A recent client, William Martin, 53, and his wife, Susan, 51, from Locust Grove, Ga., paid $275,000 for a condo listed at $600,000 in the Big Sky Town Center, because ''we've been coming here for 17 years to ski,'' he said. ''It is not crowded, not pretentious and the price was right.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the first time since a major downturn in 2007, Tom Peek, a partner at the Park City office of Prudential Utah Real Estate, is seeing ''a lot of pent-up demand'' for real estate in Park City-Deer Valley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Normally we don't see a lot of activity until Christmas time,'' Mr. Peek said, ''but our market started picking up around Thanksgiving, before the slopes were even open.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A two-bedroom condo on the ice rink in Park City could go for $600,000 (less for cash), he said; a few years ago it would have cost more than $1 million. In New Park and Redstone, developments within five miles of the ski areas, a two-bedroom new-construction condo would cost under $300,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shari Chase, president and chief executive of Chase International real estate in Nevada, said low mortgage rates (around 4 percent for buyers with good credit scores) and a federal tax credit of $6,500 for eligible repeat home buyers have helped to revive the condo market in South Lake Tahoe and Incline Village. ''People are looking for long-term investments,'' she said, ''and that's putting something that's very solid and much needed into the foundation of the housing industry.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are great values in all the areas that were overbuilt during the real estate boom years,'' she added. ''What was a million is now $600,000, and a $600,000 condo will sell for $325,000.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pamela Goetz, associate broker at <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span> Sun Valley, said: ''We all got into a fantasy world there for a while but are going back to the old rules of real estate: Make a wise purchase and anticipate holding it for a while.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ski areas in the Northeast have not been hit as hard those in the West, but condo prices, already lower than those in the West, are now the lowest in decades, brokers say. Stowe, Vt., has seen a ''noticeable uptick'' in activity in the last few months, particularly at the high end, said Brent Libby, managing broker in the Stowe office of <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> Vermont Country Properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Owners of some luxury properties are highly motivated to sell and have made it known,'' he said. He recently sold a condo listed at $1.175 million for less than $900,000 (cash) and expects the bargain prices to hold up through the spring but probably not beyond.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of his clients come from the financial world. ''The stock market is up, and everyone is feeling optimistic,'' he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sunday River and Mount Abrams in Maine are known for uncrowded slopes, short lift lines and great snow even in bad years; more than 95 percent of the terrain has snow-making equipment. Ed Kennett of Kennett Realty in Bethel, Me., is listing condos that start at $70,000 for a studio and just under $200,000 for two-bedroom units. He anticipates that the market will hit bottom by June 2010, then prices will start to rise. ''Sellers assume the bottom is hit before buyers want it to be,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deb Howard, a second-home expert at the National Association of Realtors, said that though the 2009 market was the lowest it had been in a decade she expected some good news this year. Agents said traffic was particularly high during the holidays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Typical clients come to vacation in an area many times as a renters,'' Ms. Howard said. ''When they feel comfortable and are ready to buy, it can take months or even years to find the perfect second home.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Of course,'' she added, ''there are the clients who come once, fall in love and want to buy before they step on a plane to go back home.''</p>
