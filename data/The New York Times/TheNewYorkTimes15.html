<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IT should come as no surprise to anyone that 2009 wasn't a stellar year for retailers specializing in home furnishings -- or in just about anything else. According to the Census Bureau's most recent monthly retail trade report, sales at furniture and home furnishings stores were down 11.9 percent last year from 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, the news isn't all bad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the recession, some people are still buying, at least according to the owners of a number of design stores around the country who were asked to talk about what has sold well, what hasn't -- and what they're betting on -- in a time of economic turmoil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last time the Home section surveyed design stores about their sales and what they were hoping to score big with in the season ahead, the retail landscape looked very different. In the fall of 2007, there appeared to be little anxiety among store owners about the future, and most seemed willing to take chances on unconventional pieces, which often turned out to be unexpected best sellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hand-painted ceramic pig carried by Auto in the meatpacking district was one such surprise, and it continued to sell well, to the amazement of the store's owners, Renata Bokalo and Roman Luba, until they closed their doors earlier this month. (They wouldn't comment on their reasons for closing.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But of the 11 stores surveyed last time, Auto was the only one that went out of business. And several stores actually expanded: Apartment 48 in New York and Elements in Chicago moved to larger spaces, and Koo de Kir in Boston opened a second location devoted to interior design.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time around, the retailers who were surveyed -- an entirely different group -- seemed more cautious. Larry Schaffer, the owner of OK in Los Angeles, said his strategy in the past year had been investing in ''greatest hits, things I knew would sell because I've sold them for 10 years.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ken Foster, the owner of Foster's Homeware, in Philadelphia, adopted a similar approach. ''I used to take risks and bring in a wacky thing that I knew wouldn't sell,'' Mr. Foster said. ''Now I spend my money on stuff I know will sell.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And like most of the store owners interviewed for this article, he and Mr. Schaffer have kept their inventory lean: Mr. Foster cut his stock by 20 percent last year, Mr. Schaffer by 25 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few stores reported an uptick in sales -- of cocooning items, in particular. Pamela Hewett, the owner of Stitch, in Chicago, said she ''sold more sectionals in 2009 than any year prior'' in the past decade, a change she attributes to people ''hanging out more at home'' during the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homenature in Southampton, N.Y., also saw an increase in furniture sales, despite a sharp decrease in decorator traffic, said John Heilmann, the owner. ''I think our customer that used a decorator in the city might not have been using one for their second home out here,'' Mr. Heilmann said. ''They were doing it themselves.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a few stores, the recession seems to have provided an opportunity to test new waters. Because he reduced his inventory, Mr. Schaffer said, he had the cash to ''very strategically and carefully pick up new collections.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'll probably have newer, fresher stuff this year than I've had in three years,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What follows is a small, unscientific survey of the home furnishings market across the country -- one that is in no way exhaustive, since retailers can be expected to reserve some information for competitive reasons. But it does offer a look at what's still selling, even in the midst of an economic downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For photos of the products mentioned throughout, view the interactive feature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Grange Hall, 4445 Travis Street, Dallas; (214) 443-0600 or http://urbanflowergrangehall.com [http://urbanflowergrangehall.com]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeffrey Marion Lee and Rajan Patel, the owners, met when they worked for fashion designer Victor Costa. They went on to become visual directors at Stanley Korshak, a department store, before buying a 3,000-square-foot space six years ago in the Knox-Henderson area of Dallas. In the beginning, their shop focused on floral design, but over the years their product mix has expanded to include home furnishings, books and jewelry; they also offer interior design services. The store manager, Morgan Thaxton, describes the inventory as a ''highly curated selection of bizarre gifts and unusual jewelry from around the world.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Best Seller: Mixed-Media Miniatures by David Simcik, $225 to $375 Each ''We tend to gravitate toward finding the beauty in the grotesque, and so does our clientele,'' Ms. Thaxton said. ''We have a lot of art collectors who respond to Simcik's work. He embodies our store by combining past and present and sweet and gritty and precious and mechanical. They're all one of a kind and affordable.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bomb: Seduction Porcelain Vase by Sieger by Furstenberg; White, $410; Platinum, $1,080 ''We do have that customer that gets titillated by all sorts of things, and we thought they'd love this vase. They saw the humor, but that didn't clinch the sale. Maybe it's the price -- but the platinum isn't a silver glaze, it is actual platinum! We joke that while the saying goes, 'Everything's bigger in Texas,' these just weren't ample enough for the Dallas set.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Betting On: Gilded Porcelain Elephant Knife Rests by Sieger by Furstenberg, $220 Each ''We try to keep an edited selection of little treasures in our store. This is a small object, but it elevates the table to a luxury level. They're pricey, but they're made of porcelain and hand-gilded with 24-karat gold. We love the bit of comedy in them -- that little dining companion on your table.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gretel, (786) 247-9003 or gretelhome.com</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Abby Kellett, Gretel's owner, is an interiors stylist who got her start in 2004, at Elle Decoration magazine in London. Later that year, she moved to Miami and became the style director for Inside Out magazine, now defunct, leaving in 2007 to have a baby and to do freelance styling for commercial and residential interiors. She started Gretel last year as a Web-only venture, but during Art Basel Miami Beach in December, she set up a pop-up shop in the city's design district and plans to do the same thing next year. ''With an online store, you don't get much contact with people,'' Ms. Kellett said. ''So it was nice to sit there, with all my product around me, and actually talk to people.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Best Seller: Talking Heads Beechwood Coat Hangers, $149 for Six ''They look like art when installed on a wall, whether mounted in a straight line or haphazardly,'' Ms. Kellett said. ''There's something tactile about them as well. They're a nice size, beautifully made, easy to install and serve a purpose without costing a fortune.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bomb: Omaggio Vases by Ditte Reckweg and Jelena Schou Nordentoft for Kahler, $39 to $98 ''These embody what we're about -- modern but really beautifully decorative and with a handmade touch to them. They have a real New England feel about them to me, but maybe for Miami they're a little too understated. I still have hope for them; maybe in the summer season, they'll appeal to people a bit more.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Betting On: Frame Lights by Iacoli &amp;McAllister, $145 to $225 ''I had three of these hanging in my pop-up store during Design Miami, and people really liked them. There's something minimal about them, but they have the right touch of decoration to them, and they come in vibrant candy colors like green, yellow and magenta.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stitch, 1723 North Damen Avenue, Chicago; (773) 782-1570 or stitchchicago.com</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pamela Hewett already owned a successful fashion-accessories store in the Lakeview area of Chicago in 1998, when a space opened up in the Wicker Park neighborhood where she lived. ''I wanted to do something bigger, and I wanted to sell furniture,'' she said -- and this was before Wicker Park and the neighboring Bucktown area became the retail mecca they are now. Today, she describes Stitch as a lifestyle store with a 50-50 split between home furnishings and fashion accessories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Best Seller: Animal Shot Glasses by Goody Grams, $34 Each</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These put a smile on people's faces -- do a shot, forget your problems,'' Ms. Hewett said. ''We sold a lot of Moose and Deer; maybe that's because we're in the Midwest. I also think that with the whole Americana trend -- guys with Grizzly Adams beards and plaid shirts -- these fit in well.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bomb: Delano White Leather Chair by GUS*, $865</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I thought this chair was so good looking; it looked like it belonged on the 'Mad Men' set. But it is just too hard-edged for our customers in Chicago. Here, it is all about comfort, nesting and curling up. It comes in black leather too, and neither one sold well.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Betting On: Cu Cu Clock by Umberto Tolino for Progetti, $385</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is an organic but modern piece of art that makes you laugh. That little bird comes out of this perfectly crafted Italian piece of art; it makes several different traditional bird sounds and is perfectly chirpy. They successfully mixed an Italian aesthetic with a kooky German idea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homenature, 6 Main Street, Southampton, N.Y.; (631) 287-6277 or homenature.com</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Heilmann opened the first Homenature store in Amagansett 13 years ago, with just $2,000. In 2004, he opened a second location, in Southampton. But the two stores competed with each other, so he consolidated all operations in Southampton the following year. ''Southampton has a busier downtown, and is a less seasonal town,'' Mr. Heilmann said. He describes his current environment as ''a naturally elegant mix of vintage and production pieces, with a few surprises.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Best Seller: Peace Sign Doormat, $25</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a fun item and an appropriate message for the entrance of a home,'' Mr. Heilmann said. ''The black-and-white color combination is classic; it didn't limit anyone from buying it. If it were green or orange, someone might hesitate.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bomb: Vintage 1970s Glasses, $20 each</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We sold other vintage glasses really well, but they weren't pornographic in nature. Once you put cold water in these, the women 'lose' their clothes. I thought these would be a hysterical gift for a guy, and a lot of people picked them up, but nobody bought them. I think it's the price -- at $20 each, you're spending $160 for eight, and that's a more serious price than some might want to pay for a fun thing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Betting On: Driftwood Candelabra, $215</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People are always looking for something to put in the middle of the dining room table. This speaks to that and is functional. An organic shape like this, against a really clean surface, looks more dramatic and like sculpture. These are pretty and they aren't small -- about 30 inches long by 12 inches wide. I think they'll have a wide appeal.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HW Home 1941 Pearl Street, Boulder, Colo.; (303) 545-0320 or hwhome.com</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the first HW Home store opened in Boulder 10 years ago, the company has made it its mission to provide ''Mountain Modern'' style to a clientele ranging from urban professionals to mountain residents with second homes in the city (in this case, Denver). The owners, Ron Werner and Jim Hering, hail from Chicago, where Mr. Werner was a senior vice president at Smith Barney and Mr. Hering a general manager at Holly Hunt. When Mr. Werner's sister asked them to help decorate her Boulder home, they not only fell in love with the area, but realized it was lacking what they refer to as an ''entry-level, high-end'' home furnishings boutique. They now have three more Colorado stores -- in Denver, Broomfield and Greenwood Village.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Best Seller: Czech Glass Martini Glasses and Wine Goblets, $60 Each</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're the only ones in Colorado that carry this line of glassware,'' Mr. Werner said. ''The glasses are pretty substantial -- you can use the martini glass or as a dessert dish -- and when you pick them up, you feel that they're heavy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bomb: Earthenware Tableware by Bizzirri, $17.50 to $75 Each</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Sometimes you take a chance on pieces because you love them. We designed this collection with a studio in Italy, and we chose a dramatic look and color combination that attracts a very specific customer. I think it might be a little much for every day.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Betting On: K9 Dog Beds by <span class="companylink">Mitchell Gold + Bob Williams</span>, $200 to $1,050</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're going to stock them in a machine washable fabric that's contract-grade, so it's durable and easy to take care of.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conran Shop, 407 East 59th Street, New York; (866) 755-9079 or conranusa.com</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first Conran shop, specializing in modern furniture and home accessories, opened in 1973 on Fulham Road in London. It wasn't until 1999 that the retailer opened a New York store, but the timing -- at the height of the modernist craze -- was perfect. After 10 years in the same location, under the Queensboro Bridge, the Conran Shop will move to an 8,500-square-foot space at <span class="companylink">ABC Carpet &amp;Home</span> in April. While the address will change, we're told the product mix will remain the same.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Best Seller: Melamine Nesting Bowl Set by Joseph Joseph, $59</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think the three main draws were color, function and space-saving -- it's fun and affordable,'' said David Branham, the buyer for the New York Conran Shop, explaining why the set was such a hit. ''We did a lot of gifting with this item, especially for people in their first apartments.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bomb: Boat Seat With Umbrella by Ben Fowler, $8,450</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a 100 percent functional boat -- it floats. It comes with a bracket you put on the floor, which holds it steady while you lounge on it. It was handmade by Ben Fowler as part of a project where we gave some artists and designers free rein to create something -- based on Terence's book 'Inspiration' -- and we'd put it in the shop. We put it on the floor on Sept. 19, 2008, which was right about the time the bottom started to fall out of the economy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Betting On: Louisiane Powder-Coated Galvanized Steel Bench, $695</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''New Yorkers are loving all the classic outdoor cafe furniture, thanks to the city installing so much of it in the new medians, like at Ninth Avenue and 14th Street, beside the Apple store,'' said Mr. Branham. This bench is from a French manufacturer whose goods we've sold for years. It stands out because of color and style -- it's got great curves.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foster's Homeware, 33 North Third Street, Philadelphia; (800) 734-8511 or shopfosters.com</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foster's opened in 1995, in the Old City area of Philadelphia, as a high-end cookware store. It was the vision of Ken Foster, who had been an art major at Rutgers but had worked in retail management for 15 years. ''There weren't any independent stores in downtown Philly in the '90s,'' Mr. Foster said, ''and I found my niche.'' As the area grew, so did the store, which now sells high-design items for every room of the home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Best Seller: Curve Ceramic Teapot by ForLife, $34</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's an old-fashioned teapot with a big belly shape, but a modern contemporary design,'' Mr. Foster said. ''We carry it in eight different colors, and they look great on the shelf. And it's a great price.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bomb: Club Fondue Set by Sagaform, $55</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've sold fondue pots every Christmas since we opened; this is the first time we didn't sell any. This Christmas, people were buying practical gifts, and while it's a luxury thing you might splurge on, nobody needs a fondue pot. The people who are into it already have theirs -- as a trend, fondue is finally over.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Betting On: Die-Cut Felt Trivets by Verso Design, $17 to $44</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These are made by a mother-daughter team in Finland. They base their designs on Finnish shapes -- the ones I ordered look like a berry plant. They're thick, the colors are perfect, they're functional but decorative and I haven't seen them before.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Paris Market, 36 West Broughton Street, Savannah, Ga.; (912) 232-1500 or theparismarket.com</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paula Danyluk spent 11 years working as a speech pathologist, but she harbored a passion for interior design, helping friends decorate their homes and scouring blogs to keep up to date on the latest trends. In 2004, she and her husband, Taras Danyluk, an emergency-room physician, opened a home-accessories shop they initially called the Paris Flea Market. Within a year, they had outgrown their 1,100-square-foot space and moved to a spot five times bigger on what is now a bustling thoroughfare. Ms. Danyluk describes their store as ''French style meets industrial'' -- or ''an industrial table with a drippy chandelier over it and a velvet chair in the corner.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Best Seller: Throw Pillows by Ryan Studios, $120 to $150</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have very traditional Southern homes in this town,'' Ms. Danyluk said. ''And these elegant, velvet pillows fit in very well with a Southern interior. They're down-filled and very well made, and nobody else in town carries such a nice brand.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bomb: Romero Chair by <span class="companylink">Cisco</span> Brothers, $4,032</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The company that makes this chair is family-owned and makes everything in the U.S. -- the quality is amazing. But it doesn't seem people care about quality anymore; I feel there's a rooms-to-go mentality out there. If someone can get a chair like this for $1,000, they want it. But for $4,000, they want an antique.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Betting On: Fold-In Chandelier by Tim Adams, $1,800</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The scale of this piece is very dramatic -- it's 54 inches wide by 45 inches high -- and it's handmade by a local artist who is pretty hot right now. I think it's a great price for a handmade item, and he'll custom-make this in different sizes and with different patinas.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Propeller, 555 Hayes Street, San Francisco; (415) 701-7767 or propellermodern.com</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lorn Dittfeld, the owner, grew up in Miami and spent summers working at an uncle's custom furniture shop. Yet he majored in finance, worked in advertising and traveled the world for a year before finally settling in San Francisco, where he took classes in architecture and color theory at the University of California, Berkeley. ''I knew I was on the design highway, but didn't know which exit I should get off at,'' Mr. Dittfeld said. At a friend's suggestion, he opened Propeller in 2002, with the aim of making furniture, doing interior design and selling the work of independent and emerging designers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Best Seller: Light Bulb by SMC, $48 to $138</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People like the shape and seem intrigued by the intricacy of it. They associate this bulb with something that is old -- it is a feeling of nostalgia, and nostalgia is a happy place. All that aside, they're beautiful objects, they shine and reflect other light. It's almost a completely unpretentious piece of art,'' said Mr. Dittfeld.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bomb: War Bowl, Made of Melted Toy Soldiers, by Dominic Wilcox, $400</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In this moment we're in, maybe they're too frivolous. It's a $400 bowl that you certainly won't be putting any soup in. You can't even use it as a fruit bowl. It's an object, in of itself, and it can't be anything more than that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Betting On: Cain Collection Chair by Seth Eshelman for Staach, $300 to $425 Each</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think these guys are doing great stuff,'' Mr. Dittfeld said. ''The chair itself is a clean, simple design -- the antidote to the opulence and extravagance of the zeros decade. They harken back to an earlier era of small shops, almost a Shaker type of idea. And I think it's a good price.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OK, 8303 West Third Street, Los Angeles; (323) 653-3501 or okthestore.com</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Larry Schaffer opened OK in 2002, it quickly became a destination for design aficionados from all over the country. Mr. Schaffer is a veteran of the furniture business: in the late '80s, as a 25-year-old, he was put in charge of a furniture store in Los Angeles that he declines to name, but describes as being ''like Modern Age was in New York at that time.'' After it ''crashed and burned,'' he said, he did odd jobs, like working at a glass gallery, before starting his own home-accessories business with just $5,000, two years before he opened OK. He describes his clientele as ''extremely smart, sophisticated and hip, but not in my field. They know as much about fashion, literature and film as I know about design.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Best Seller: Leather bookends by Sandy Voor, $150 to $185 a pair (sold out)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I travel all over the world and so does my customer. Things have become so global that you'll see some of the same things in each store, whether it's 10 Corso Como or Colette,'' Mr. Schaffer said, referring to the well-known stores in Milan and Paris. ''But you won't see these everywhere, because they're handmade by a woman in upstate New York. People like something that was made by a real person. I put these in our children's book section, and I had to reorder them four times in December.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bomb: Blown-glass bowl by Bill Burch, $325</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Because I used to work for a vintage glass dealer, I know that Bill's stuff is extremely sophisticated and well made. If my customers were glass aficionados, they'd realize this and want it. But they're not, which is why we stopped selling really expensive glass a few years ago.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Betting On: Ceramic tube vases by Josh Herman, $200 to $300</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People are really interested in pottery right now. It's earthy and understated. The thing that is hardest to find are ceramics that are simple and pure, but also beautiful. These are beautifully thrown, but what makes them is the glaze -- Josh does very skilled work.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kuhl-Linscomb, 2424 West Alabama, Houston; (713) 526-6000 or kuhl-linscomb.com</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most stores featured here are small boutiques, but Kuhl-Linscomb is an exception -- a 70,000-square-foot store spanning five buildings, owned by the husband-and-wife team Pam Kuhl-Linscomb and Dan Linscomb. Mrs. Kuhl-Linscomb started an interior design firm in 1984, and the couple opened the store 10 years later. Their product mix includes nearly everything for the home -- both new and antique -- along with stationery, CD's, jewelry and apothecary items. The company offers interior design services as well, focusing on specific spaces like closets and kitchens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Best Seller: Screw Dining Tables by Tom Dixon, $1,700 or $1,260</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The table has an industrial look and Old World look at the same time -- the marble top has a great patina to it -- so it appealed to a wide range of customers,'' Ms. Kuhl-Linscomb said. ''And Tom Dixon is really hot right now, so people who know him love that table even more.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bomb: Third Drawer Down Linen Tea Towels, $42 Each</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These are beautifully designed, but not easy to understand. We think we had them in the wrong area -- we tried to merchandise them with our traditional tea towels, and I think they cater to a more artistic customer.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Betting On:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">La Stanza Dello Scirocco Baskets by Mario Trimarchi for Alessi, $32 to $120 Each ''We noticed a lot of geometric shapes in design right now. We're displaying this in a setting at the center of a table, and people notice it right away -- it's gotten a lot of interest. It's in an area with other designers that this customer likes or will recognize, like Philippe Starck and Michael Graves.''</p>

</div><div class="author">By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS </div><div>508 words</div><div>28 January 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>11</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales of new homes unexpectedly fell 7.6 percent last month, capping the industry's weakest year on record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">December's sales fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 342,000 from an upwardly revised November pace of 370,000, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. Economists surveyed by Thomson Reuters had forecast a pace of 370,000 for December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results were the weakest since March and indicated demand remained sluggish despite newly expanded tax incentives to spur sales. The report will probably fuel concern that the housing market turnaround will falter when government support ends this spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom Brown, co-owner of Crown Home Builders in Summerville, S.C., was not surprised that last month was poor. Buyers are having trouble meeting tough criteria for mortgage loans, he said. And though builders are cutting prices, the shaky economy and weak job market are keeping home shoppers away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People are holding on to what they have,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only 374,000 homes were sold last year, down 23 percent from a year earlier and the weakest year on record dating back to 1963. December's sales were nearly 9 percent below the same month last year. This year, the National Association of Homebuilders is forecasting more than 500,000 sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if that happens, ''it hardly makes you ecstatic,'' said Bernard M. Markstein, senior economist at the trade group, noting that the industry clocked more than 1 million sales a year from 2003 through 2006</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales have had a rocky recovery from their four-year slide. December's sales pace for new homes was up 4 percent from the bottom in January 2009, but down 75 percent from the peak in July 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price of $221,300 in December was down nearly 4 percent from $229,600 a year earlier, but up about 5 percent from November's median of $210,300.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales varied widely across the country. Sales of new homes plummeted by 41 percent in the Midwest and fell by 7 percent in the South. But they skyrocketed 43 percent in the Northeast and rose 5 percent in the West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any housing recovery this year will probably be slow. Experts forecast sales of new and previously occupied homes to weaken after tax credits for homebuyers expire in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, the housing recovery has been fueled mainly by hundreds of billions in federal spending that has pushed down mortgage rates and propped up demand. Congress decided last year to extend a tax credit of up to $8,000 for first-time buyers until the end of April. Homeowners who have lived in their current properties for at least five years can claim a tax credit of up to $6,500 if they relocate.</p>

</div><div class="author">By DAVID STREITFELD </div><div>811 words</div><div>27 January 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recovery in the housing market is still alive, barely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices managed a 0.2 percent seasonally adjusted gain in November from the previous month, according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span> Case-Shiller Home Price Index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data, released Tuesday, reflected frenzied activity in 20 major cities as people competed to buy houses to take advantage of a government tax credit. But all those sales did not produce much more than flat prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A second index released on Tuesday showed a healthier market. The <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> said its price index, which uses data from mortgages that have been sold to or guaranteed by the government, rose 0.7 percent in November from the previous month. But the agency also revised its October figures downward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To blur the picture even more, a third national housing price index was released last week. Issued by the data firm First American CoreLogic, it showed a decline of 0.2 percent in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Put all these indexes together, and a portrait emerges of a market going nowhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The winter pause that people thought was going to happen seems to be happening,'' said Maureen Maitland, vice president for index services at S.&amp;P.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A pause is certainly better than a plunge, which is what was happening during 2007 and 2008. But sales have slowed markedly since November. It is only a matter of time, the analysts say, before prices also undergo at least a slight dip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We expect home price deflation to resume in the December or January Case-Shiller indices and continue through 2010,'' Zelman &amp;Associates wrote in a research note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 20-city Case-Shiller composite price index is down 29.2 percent from its peak in the second quarter of 2006 and 5.3 percent over the last year. Average home prices are where they were in late 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices in five of the cities fell in November from the previous month, while 15 rose. Las Vegas managed to snap its long losing streak and eke out a 0.1 percent gain. The strongest cities were on the West Coast, including San Francisco, San Diego and Los Angeles. The five that fell included Chicago, Miami and New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The West Coast Case-Shiller numbers were backed up by the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> data, which showed that the Pacific was the strongest of nine United States regions both for the month and the last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nothing is simple about real estate these days, however. Jim Klinge, an agent in northern San Diego who keeps a close watch on sales trends, recently published on his blog comparative statistics for the first 15 days of January going back 12 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were 61 closed deals in the two weeks this year, which places 2010 roughly between the 1999 peak of 125 and the 2008 nadir of 36. But the price buyers are paying per square foot -- one of the most accurate measures of pricing trends -- is still falling. Last year it was $410 a foot; this year, it is $368.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The local market ''is blazingly hot,'' Mr. Klinge said, but only for sellers who want to get rid of their place, quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These sellers feel like they're giving the house away, which is what buyers want,'' he said. ''If the sellers price the house too high, no one will even look at it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only sellers who can do this, of course, are ones willing and able to take a big loss. Mr. Klinge showed a house Tuesday that was for sale for $800,000. The owners had paid $975,000 a few years ago, so they will lose nearly all their down payment. ''It was a second home, and they just wanted to be rid of it,'' the agent said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seasonal adjustments are affecting the numbers in San Diego and everywhere else. These have the effect of smoothing out swings in the raw numbers. On an unadjusted basis, the individual cities in the Case-Shiller index fared worse: 13 fell, while the composite price index dropped 0.2 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conference Board's monthly measure of consumer confidence, also released Tuesday, rose to 55.9 in January from a revised 53.6 in December. That was more of an improvement than analysts had expected but still low by historical standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dan Greenhaus, chief economic strategist with <span class="companylink">Miller Tabak</span>, said that the long-term average was about 95, and that the high reading was 144 early in 2000. ''Clearly more work on the confidence front needs to be done,'' he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By their own admission, it is a long shot. But for the tenants of Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village, the news that Tishman Speyer Properties had relinquished ownership of their sprawling plain-Jane apartment complex on the East Side of Manhattan revived an old dream:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe they could try again to buy it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've been actively discussing it,'' said Alvin Doyle, president of the Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village Tenants Association. ''We have to get some financial advisers on board. Try to figure out how we could put it together.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Little is certain about what the future holds for Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village, an expanse of 110 brick apartment buildings east of First Avenue between 14th Street and 23rd Street. In 2006, its tenants bid $4.5 billion to buy the complex but were bested by Tishman Speyer's offer of $5.4 billion, which became the biggest real estate deal of its kind in United States history and now counts among its biggest busts. On Monday, Tishman Speyer and its partner, BlackRock Realty, announced that they would turn the complex over to its creditors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The announcement stunned and alarmed tenants, who knew that Tishman Speyer had defaulted on its mortgage but did not expect its departure to be so abrupt. Immediate fears -- that maintenance would deteriorate, that burnt-out light bulbs would go unchanged, that piles of garbage would be left to molder -- were magnified by broader ones about the long-term affordability and character of the place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's been so up in the air whether or not they were going to default. It's scary,'' said Kerry Shimaitis, who is 36 and has lived in Stuyvesant Town for eight years. ''I can't even begin to imagine what it means.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since its construction in 1947, the complex has offered affordable housing to middle-income renters, but that began changing in recent years as the previous owner, Metropolitan Life, started charging much steeper rents on apartments they could free from rent stabilization. Tishman Speyer expected to continue that trend, in part by seeking to oust tenants who did not qualify for rent protection, including those who Tishman Speyer claimed did not live there for most of the year. But the new owners could not move enough apartments to market rate, and quickly fell behind on debt payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The eventual next owner could be responsible for at least part of the estimated $200 million owed to thousands of Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper residents, according to Alexander H. Schmidt, who represented tenants in a class-action lawsuit. The state's highest court ruled in October that rents on 4,400 of the complex's units had been improperly raised to market rates. Those residents' rents were reduced in January, but no payments for previous overcharges have been made, according to Mr. Schmidt. And it was still unclear whether Tishman Speyer, their creditors or <span class="companylink">MetLife</span> would fully be off the hook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is not a blow to the tenants; it doesn't change or alter anything of significance in the case,'' Mr. Schmidt said. ''Whoever the owners of the property are, they will be liable for the tenants' claims. That's just the way the law works in that area. Tenants have nothing to fear.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also uncertain was how much city, state or federal officials might intervene in the complex's financial predicament, if at all. Government leaders did get deeply involved in helping to block the sale of another middle-income housing complex, Starrett City in Brooklyn in 2007. But city officials said that case was different because Starrett City was the country's largest federally subsidized housing complex.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet city and federal officials did hasten on Monday to say that they would work closely with CW Capital, which represents the principal creditors, and Tishman Speyer to ensure that the property remained well maintained in the short run, and affordable in years to come, though they offered no specifics on how either goal might be achieved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the short term, we are going to work with tenants and local leaders to make sure that maintenance and upkeep continue,'' Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York wrote in an e-mail statement, ''and over the longer term, we must ensure that whoever buys the properties is committed to maintaining them as haven for the middle class which it has always been.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rafael E. Cestero, the city's housing commissioner, said that it was ''in everyone's interest'' to keep Stuyvesant Town well maintained and run until a new owner was found. ''We are watching very closely,'' he said, ''to ensure that while the financial trouble is working itself out, that the physical condition does not deteriorate.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amid Monday morning's steady downpour, several residents voiced the hope that the financial tumult might help return the complex to an earlier, more stable time, when tenants paid less but stayed longer, creating a more rooted community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They turned it into an N.Y.U. campus,'' said Terence Jones, 51, an electrician who has been a resident for a dozen years. ''We're hoping it can go back more to the way it was before it got sold.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article on Tuesday about the fallout from the failed deal for Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village, the two largest apartment complexes in Manhattan, misidentified one investor that stands to lose its entire stake. It is the Newcastle Investment Corporation, a public company managed by the Fortress Investment Group -- not Fortress itself. (The same error appeared in an accompanying chart in some editions.) The article also misspelled the abbreviation for another investor, the California State Teachers' Retirement System. It is known as Calstrs, not Calsters. And the chart also reversed the amounts invested by Calstrs and the Florida state pension fund. Calstrs invested $100 million, and the Florida fund invested $250 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Wed Jan 27 2010</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the beginning, investors and lenders could not get enough of the record-breaking $5.4 billion deal to buy the largest apartment complexes in Manhattan: Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, three years later, they cannot get away from it fast enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The partnership that bought the 80-acre property on the East River announced on Monday that it was turning the keys over to its lenders after it defaulted on its loans and the value of the property fell below $2 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet in walking away, the partners, Tishman Speyer Properties and BlackRock Realty, have left tenants in limbo and other investors with far bigger losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the other companies, banks, countries and pension funds -- including the government of Singapore, the Church of England, the Manhattan real estate concern SL Green, and Fortress Investment Groups -- that invested billions of dollars in the 2006 deal stand to lose their entire stake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''At the time, it looked like a sound investment,'' said Clark McKinley, a spokesman for Calpers, the giant California public employees' pension fund, which bought a $500 million stake in the property. ''When the market tanked, we got caught.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calpers, he added, has written off its investment. So has Calsters, a California pension fund that invested $100 million, as has a Florida pension fund that put $250 million into the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though nearly all of the attention and blame surrounding the default has been directed toward Tishman Speyer, it will lose only its original investment of $112 million. (BlackRock will also lose $112 million.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any collateral damage to Tishman Speyer, which manages a $33.5 billion portfolio of 72 million square feet of property in the United States, Europe, Asia and Latin America, was expected to be minimal; real estate experts said that Tishman's reputation might suffer, but that the firm would still be able to put together deals and raise capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a big black eye for them,'' said John McIlwain, a senior fellow for housing at the Urban Land Institute. ''But it's not the end of Tishman. They own a lot of property. It's a dent, but not the end.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For decades, Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village were an oasis for middle-class New Yorkers; they were built in the 1940s by Metropolitan Life, which received tax breaks and other incentives in exchange for keeping rents low, initially for the World War II veterans who were the first tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With rents and condominium prices skyrocketing in 2006, <span class="companylink">MetLife</span> put developments on the auction block. A partnership formed by Tishman Speyer and BlackRock paid $5.4 billion. The acquisition cost was actually $6.3 billion, because the partnership had to raise $900 million for reserve funds to cover interest payments, apartment renovations and capital improvements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rental income did not cover the monthly debt service. But the two partners were betting that they could turn a healthy profit over time as they replaced rent-regulated residents with tenants willing to pay higher market-rate rents. But their plan fell apart when they could not convert enough apartments to the higher rents as quickly as they had planned. And in the past two years, average rents in New York have fallen sharply, along with property values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, analysts predicted that Tishman Speyer and BlackRock would default. That prediction intensified when New York State's highest court ruled in the fall that the partnership had improperly deregulated and raised the rents on 4,400 apartments. The partners were forced to roll back rents and they have been in negotiations on rebates owed to tenants. (The eventual owners, not Tishman Speyer and BlackRock, are expected to inherit liability for the $215 million in rent rebates.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Jan. 8, the owners defaulted on $4.4 billion in loans ($3 billion in senior mortgages and $1.4 billion in secondary loans). They had also raised $1.9 billion in equity. The problem was that the latest appraisal put the value of the complexes at about $1.9 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's the poster child for the entire housing bubble,'' said Daniel Alpert, managing partner of Westwood Capital. ''There'll be some other spectacular blowups, but this will be at the top of the pecking order.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McIlwain said it may take a decade or more for the prices to reach the levels they did in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You're talking about a prime deal at the top of the market when money was fast and free,'' he said. ''You're not going to see money that is fast and free until bankers' memories fade, which typically takes 10 years.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, real estate analysts said the collapse of the Stuyvesant Town deal would send ripples throughout the real estate investment community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The fact that they have given the keys back is going to have a chilling effect,'' said Keven Lindemann, director of real estate for the research firm SNL Financial, which covers publicly traded real estate. ''This was such an enormous transaction that it looks like most, if not all, of the equity is going to be wiped out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Government of Singapore Investment Corporation</span>, which made a $575 million secondary loan, and invested as much as $200 million in equity, stands to lose all of that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CWCapital, the company that is negotiating with Tishman Speyer and BlackRock on behalf of the mortgage holders, declined to comment. With Tishman Speyer stepping down as manager of the 11,227 apartments, CWCapital has talked to both the LeFrak Organization, which owns and manages thousands of apartments in Queens and elsewhere, and Rose Associates, the Manhattan company that had managed the two complexes before Tishman Speyer took over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This month, several of the secondary lenders sent letters to Tishman Speyer and BlackRock threatening foreclosure because of the default. The partners tried unsuccessfully to craft a new deal that would have involved them putting up ''several hundred million dollars,'' in return for restructuring the loans, according to one real estate executive briefed on the negotiations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The secondary lenders, he said, had ''overplayed their hand'' in the hope that they would get back some of their investment. Instead of being forced into bankruptcy, Tishman Speyer and BlackRock will walk away sometime after a new manager is in place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> may be in the best position of anyone involved in the deal's financing. They acquired over $2 billion in securities backed, in part, by the $3 billion Stuyvesant Town mortgages. Fannie and Freddi Mac have to be paid before any other debtholders, but they are not parties to the negotiations over the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They may well become an integral part of the solution. In a report issued Monday, <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> suggested that CWCapital's most likely action will be to wipe out the existing mortgage and attempt to sell the complexes. ''Given the size of the properties and an asking price likely to be well in excess of $1 billion, a sale may necessitate <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> providing financing to a potential buyer,'' the report said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales plunged more than expected in December, raising fresh questions about whether the housing market can function without ample government assistance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes in December fell 16.7 percent from November, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.45 million units, the National Association of Realtors said Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts had been expecting a weak number. Sales of existing homes were pushed up in the fall by fears that the government's $8,000 tax credit for first-time buyers would be allowed to expire as scheduled on Nov. 30. As buyers rushed to sign contracts, sales rose to an annual rate of 6.54 million units in November, the highest level in nearly three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The credit was broadened and extended in November, and potential buyers lost their sense of urgency. December sales were at the lowest annual rate since August, though still 15 percent higher than December 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most experts expect sales in January to be equally weak, but think that activity will once again increase as the next, and supposedly final, expiration date for the tax credit draws near. Unless Congress extends the credit again, buyers have until April 30 to conclude a deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What happens after that is harder to predict.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Given that the tax credit appears to account for a good deal of the improvement in the housing market,'' Paul Dales, an economist for Capital Economics, wrote in a research note, ''we're becoming increasingly concerned that the housing recovery will falter once it is removed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The credit is the government's most visible means of support for the housing market but not the only one. Two of the biggest are also undergoing changes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Housing Administration, which has been supporting the market by insuring loans to first-time buyers, is modestly tightening its standards. And the Federal Reserve, which has been buying mortgage-backed securities in an effort to keep mortgage rates low, says it is ending that program over the next few months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government programs can do only so much. Buyers are still at the mercy of lenders, which have become reluctant to make home loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Arslanian, an Internet advertising executive in Boston, was waiting Monday to find out if his loan had come through. He took a moment to marvel at the contrast between his experiences this time and his previous purchase of a house, in Philadelphia in 2001.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first time, the entire process -- looking, bidding, making a deal and getting a loan -- took about a month, he recalled. In that era, long before the excesses of the boom had ruined everything, home-buying was a relatively routine process, little more complicated than buying a car.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time, Mr. Arslanian and his wife, Anna, a doctor, looked for more than two years. Few of the houses they saw seemed to be good deals. But since the market was declining, they felt no rush.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, they found a two-family house in Belmont, a suburb, that offered potential. Their bid in the upper six figures was accepted, but getting a loan was arduous. Several banks declined to give them mortgages under any terms, despite their down payment of 25 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2001, Mr. Arslanian showed his lender two pay stubs. ''This time, I've sent every bank stub for the last year, every canceled rent check, letters from my landlord,'' he said. ''Every day, I'm on the phone with the loan officer trying to reconcile another piece of information.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three out of four regions of the country shared relatively equally in the December drop. The Midwest was down 25.8 percent from November; the Northeast fell 19.5 percent; and the South slid 16.3 percent. The West fared best, down 4.9 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes on the market is continuing to fall, dropping to 3.29 million. But since sales fell even faster, the supply on the market rose to 7.2 months of inventory in December, from 6.5 months in November. Larger inventories often portend a drop in prices. A normal market has about a six-month supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Distressed homes accounted for about a third of all sales in December, down from levels approaching 50 percent earlier in the year but also much higher than in a normal market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another sign of poor health in housing is the continued weakness in new home construction. In many markets, builders cannot compete with the price of foreclosures. The Commerce Department reported last week that December starts were at a seasonally adjusted annual sale rate of 557,000, only about 16 percent above the record low last April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real estate association said that 2009 was the first year since 2005 to record an annual sales gain. Sales in 2009 were up 4.8 percent from 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the December drop, the release on Tuesday of the Case-Shiller home price data for November will be watched even more closely than usual. After a summer and fall of modest improvement, analysts are expecting the results to be unchanged at best from the previous month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another price index, from First American CoreLogic, reported last week that November prices dropped 0.2 percent from October.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The owners of Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village, the iconic middle-class housing complexes overlooking the East River in Manhattan, have decided to turn over the properties to creditors, officials said Monday morning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decision by Tishman Speyer Properties and BlackRock Realty comes four years after the $5.4 billion purchase of the complexes' 110 buildings and 11,227 apartments in what was the most expensive real estate deal of its kind in American history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surrender of the properties, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, ends a tortured real estate saga that saw the partnership make expensive improvements to the complex and then try to rent the apartments at higher market rates in a real estate boom. But a real estate downturn and the city's strong rent protections hindered those efforts, leaving the buyers scrambling to make payments on loans due for the properties, which have been a comfortable harbor for the city's middle class since they opened in the late 1940s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have spent the last few weeks negotiating in good faith to restructure the debt and ownership of Stuyvesant Town/Peter Cooper Village,'' said the statement by the partnership. ''Over the last few days, however, it has become clear to us through this process that the only viable alternative to bankruptcy would be to transfer control and operation of the property, in an orderly manner, to the lenders and their representatives.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Metropolitan Life built the complexes for World War II veterans in the 1940s, when the city was in desperate need of new housing. It received tax breaks and other incentives in return for maintaining low rents. The buildings became home for generations of workers searching for an affordable spot in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with the real estate market soaring in 2005, <span class="companylink">MetLife</span> decided to sell. Tishman Speyer and BlackRock won an auction the following year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This month, the partnership headed by Tishman Speyer defaulted on $3 billion in debt on the properties, and in the last few days secondary lenders have been calling to replace the partnership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under one scenario, Tishman would have been offered a long-term contract to operate the complex, but it rejected that plan. Lenders will now be looking for new managers for Stuyvesant Town, and its smaller adjacent property, Peter Cooper Village, where the rents are typically higher and the apartments more spacious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surrender of the property is a huge blow to Tishman Speyer, which controls Rockefeller Center and the Chrysler Building. When it spearheaded the Stuyvesant Town purchase, it projected itself as the best stewards of such an iconic property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But instead Tishman Speyer and its partner BlackRock found themselves facing a mountain of debt. It had been negotiating since November to restructure $3 billion worth of loans and to hold on to the properties, which cover 80 acres east of First Avenue, from 14th Street to 23rd Street. But their reserves, once stuffed with $890 million for capital improvements, interest payments and renovations, were left virtually depleted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rents collected did not cover the mortgage payments, as the new owners failed in their efforts to increase net income by steadily renovating and deregulating vacant apartments while raising rents substantially.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For tenant advocates and urban planners, the sale underscored the loss of affordable housing in the city and the highly speculative financial structures that, they warned, would only end in disaster.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MUCH has been said about the high rate of home foreclosures, but the most interesting question may be this: Why is the mortgage default rate so low?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After all, millions of American homeowners are ''underwater,'' meaning that they owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth. In Nevada, nearly two-thirds of homeowners are in this category. Yet most of them are dutifully continuing to pay their mortgages, despite substantial financial incentives for walking away from them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A family that financed the entire purchase of a $600,000 home in 2006 could now find itself still owing most of that mortgage, even though the home is now worth only $300,000. The family could rent a similar home for much less than its monthly mortgage payment, saving thousands of dollars a year and hundreds of thousands over a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some homeowners may keep paying because they think it's immoral to default. This view has been reinforced by government officials like former Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr., who while in office said that anyone who walked away from a mortgage would be ''simply a speculator -- and one who is not honoring his obligation.'' (The irony of a former investment banker denouncing speculation seems to have been lost on him.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But does this really come down to a question of morality?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A provocative paper by Brent White, a law professor at the University of Arizona, makes the case that borrowers are actually suffering from a ''norm asymmetry.'' In other words, they think they are obligated to repay their loans even if it is not in their financial interest to do so, while their lenders are free to do whatever maximizes profits. It's as if borrowers are playing in a poker game in which they are the only ones who think bluffing is unethical.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That norm might have been appropriate when the lender was the local banker. More commonly these days, however, the loan was initiated by an aggressive mortgage broker who maximized his fees at the expense of the borrower's costs, while the debt was packaged and sold to investors who bought mortgage-backed securities in the hope of earning high returns, using models that predicted possible default rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The morality argument is especially weak in a state like California or Arizona, where mortgages are so-called nonrecourse loans. That means the mortgage is secured by the home itself; in a default, the lender has no claim on a borrower's other possessions. Nonrecourse mortgages may be viewed as financial transactions in which the borrower has the explicit option of giving the lender the keys to the house and walking away. Under these circumstances, deciding whether to default might be no more controversial than deciding whether to claim insurance after your house burns down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, borrowers in nonrecourse states pay extra for the right to default without recourse. In a report prepared for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Susan Woodward, an economist, estimated that home buyers in such states paid an extra $800 in closing costs for each $100,000 they borrowed. These fees are not made explicit to the borrower, but if they were, more people might be willing to default, figuring that they had paid for the right to do so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morality aside, there are other factors deterring ''strategic defaults,'' whether in recourse or nonrecourse states. These include the economic and emotional costs of giving up one's home and moving, the perceived social stigma of defaulting, and a serious hit to a borrower's credit rating. Still, if they added up these costs, many households might find them to be far less than the cost of paying off an underwater mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An important implication is that we could be facing another wave of foreclosures, spurred less by spells of unemployment and more by strategic thinking. Research shows that bankruptcies and foreclosures are ''contagious.'' People are less likely to think it's immoral to walk away from their home if they know others who have done so. And if enough people do it, the stigma begins to erode.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spurt of strategic defaults in a neighborhood might also reduce some other psychic costs. For example, defaulting is more attractive if I can rent a nearby house that is much like mine (whose owner has also defaulted) without taking my children away from their friends and their school.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, lenders have been reluctant to renegotiate mortgages, and government programs to stimulate renegotiation have not gained much traction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eric Posner, a law professor, and Luigi Zingales, an economist, both from the University of Chicago, have made an interesting suggestion: Any homeowner whose mortgage is underwater and who lives in a ZIP code where home prices have fallen at least 20 percent should be eligible for a loan modification. The bank would be required to reduce the mortgage by the average price reduction of homes in the neighborhood. In return, it would get 50 percent of the average gain in neighborhood prices -- if there is one -- when the house is eventually sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because their homes would no longer be underwater, many people would no longer have a reason to default. And they would be motivated to maintain their homes because, if they later sold for more than the average price increase, they would keep all the extra profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks are unlikely to endorse this if they think people will keep paying off their mortgages. But if a new wave of foreclosures begins, the banks, too, would be better off under this plan. Rather than getting only the house's foreclosure value, they would also get part of the eventual upside when the owner voluntarily sold the house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This plan, which would require Congressional action, would not cost the government anything. It may not be perfect, but something like it may be necessary to head off a tsunami of strategic defaults.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article last Sunday about new rental units coming online this year in New York City misstated the role Rose Associates has with two buildings in Brooklyn, 184 Kent Street and 34 Berry Street. It is marketing the buildings, not managing them. The article also misstated the title Robert Scaglion holds at the company. He is the senior managing director of residential marketing, not the managing director.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Sun Jan 31 2010</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SCORES of stalled construction projects can be found scattered around New York City, but one category of building that doesn't seem to have been sidetracked by the recession is the luxury apartment rental.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least 16 new rental buildings are expected to open in Manhattan in coming months, ranging from small buildings to 500-unit high-rises, for a total of more than 3,500 apartments. Brooklyn will get an additional 3,500 new apartments as well, including units in some buildings that opened in late 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While 7,000 new apartments is a relatively small number for a city where 70 percent of 8 million residents live in rentals, many of the new buildings are concentrated in just three neighborhoods: Manhattan's Hudson Yards area, downtown Brooklyn and Williamsburg.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These apartments are becoming available at a time when average rents are down by about 25 percent from the market's height in early 2008; vacancy is close to 2 percent, compared with just under 1 percent in 2007 and 2006; and the city is still losing jobs. As a result, the new buildings are offering a range of incentives to lure tenants, including one to five months of free rent, free gym memberships, <span class="companylink">American Express</span> gift cards and even free iPods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new buildings, with all their enticements, will most likely set off another round of apartment musical chairs -- first seen in 2009 -- in which many renters with leases coming up will try to move to fancier buildings or better deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rents have already dropped to the levels they reached in 2000, and the influx of apartments is expected to keep them there. New studios in the Hudson Yards area could start at $2,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The opening of new buildings is really going to be the keynote of 2010,'' said David J. Wine, a vice chairman at the Related Companies, which owns and manages about 5,000 rental units in New York City, but does not have a building opening this year. He said that Manhattan had not had to absorb this many new market-rate apartments in more than a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after the surge of new buildings in 2010, Mr. Wine and other rental developers said, rental construction in the city will hit a lull. ''After these buildings are completed, there's going to be nothing, because banks stopped financing,'' he said, referring to the credit crunch that started in late 2008 and has hit developers and home buyers equally hard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Nothing''may be a slight exaggeration, since Related hopes to open a new building on 10th Avenue and 42nd Street in 2011 and has eventual plans to build some 5,000 units directly over the Hudson Yards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Robert Scaglion, the managing director of residential marketing for Rose Associates, thinks the ''nothing'' assessment is about right. ''This is going to be the end of all the rental developments that were planned three to five years ago,'' he said. ''And after this group hits the market, there's not going to be much else.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rose is managing two Williamsburg buildings that are to open soon -- 184 Kent, a 338-unit converted warehouse, and 34 Berry, a 140-unit building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As developers work to fill their new buildings in 2010, Frederick S. Harris, a senior vice president for development at <span class="companylink">AvalonBay Communities</span>, said that ''you almost by definition have to have a pause.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Avalon just opened Avalon Fort Greene, a 630-unit unit building that is actually in downtown Brooklyn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We will be delivering Avalon Fort Greene through most of this year because it's such a large building,'' Mr. Harris said. ''And this will be our last delivery for a while.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Avalon has plans for another rental tower in West Chelsea but is not likely to break ground there until next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although new buildings will open throughout the city in the coming months, the largest concentration will be in neighborhoods that developers had pegged as the latest frontiers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Hudson Yards area, which is bounded by 30th Street, 42nd Street, Eighth Avenue and the Hudson River, four large projects have started or will soon start leasing apartments: Silver Towers, two 60-story glass towers with nearly 1,000 market-rate apartments built by Silverstein Properties; Emerald Green, a 569-unit project developed by Glenwood Management; Ohm, a 288-unit building from Douglaston Development; and 505 West 37th Street, two towers with 835 units developed by TF Cornerstone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of new apartments expected for downtown Brooklyn in 2010 is no less extensive: the 650 units at Avalon Fort Greene; 365 units at 80 Dekalb, a 36-story tower built by Forest City Ratner; 512 units at Brooklyn Gold, a project of Lalezarian Developers; and 491 units at the Brooklyner, a 51-story tower from the Clarett Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers and brokers say that rental activity has been strong at buildings that opened in late 2009. But some community leaders are skeptical.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andrew Berman, a member of the Hudson Yards Community Advisory Committee, said, ''The market is simply not there for them, and the only way they're filling apartments is by doing things that they never intended to do, just to get tenants.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The neighborhood, Mr. Berman said, is ''not equipped to handle this flood of product.'' He pointed to ''insane traffic, lack of public schools and lack of an affordable, full-service supermarket.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Harris of Avalon said that while it would have been much easier to fill buildings in a stronger economy, he did not see the surge of new units in downtown Brooklyn as a problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Having four buildings come on line at the same time can be a good thing when you're in an emerging neighborhood,'' he said. ''People won't think: 'Why is this guy here? Did he make a big mistake?' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, he said, there's ''a sense that the neighborhood is really changing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new buildings have amenities meant to appeal to 20- and 30-somethings -- swimming pools, expansive gyms, screening rooms, large roof decks, game rooms with pool tables or arcade games. For incentives, landlords are paying brokers' fees and offering one or two months' free rent on 14-month leases, and as much as five free months on two-year leases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers generally have already reduced their original projected monthly rents by a minimum of 10 percent. But the sales pitch often revolves around ''net effective rent,'' which takes free rent into account to bring the number down further. That could mean net rent for a studio starting at $2,000 in the Hudson Yards area and about $1,400 in downtown Brooklyn. The average rent for Manhattan studios in the last quarter of 2009 was $2,253, according to Prudential Douglas Elliman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everybody is competitive in terms of giving incentives,'' said Clifford Finn, the managing director of new development marketing for Citi Habitats, ''but with everybody giving about the same, it puts you back in an apples-to-apples comparison, so it comes back down to location and the actual product.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for free iPods, offered to people who signed leases at 60 Monitor Street, a 60-unit building in Williamsburg, they were attention-grabbers pure and simple. ''Differentiating yourself is half the battle,'' said David Maundrell, the president of aptsandlofts.com, which has the listing. Other incentives included a month of free rent and no broker's fee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Once you get them in the door, they still come prepared to negotiate,'' Mr. Maundrell said. ''If there's one or two months free, people are asking for $50 off on top of that, and in a rollout, we try to look at every deal and we'll consider it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The carefully baited hooks are apparently working. The northern tower of Emerald Green offered one to two months' free rent and was 80 percent rented in the three months between Labor Day and Christmas, a traditionally slow time of year. The same offer at the much larger Silver Towers resulted in the leasing of about 400 apartments, or 40 percent, since it opened last May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The promotions at new buildings will undoubtedly also help keep prices down elsewhere in the city. Marc Lewis, the president of Century 21 NY Metro, estimated that rents had dropped to 2000-era levels. He said they were not likely to climb anytime soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Landlords don't want to publicize it,'' he said. ''But if something is listed at $2,100, a tenant will offer $1,900 and maybe they'll settle on $2,000, with possibly a free month thrown in, plus the landlord pays the commission.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Chris Albanese, a principal of the Albanese Organization, which has rental towers in Chelsea and Battery Park City, said he didn't think the new inventory would directly compete with his buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Are some people coming in and saying, 'I can get two months' free rent and the rent is only $2,200 over there'? Of course,'' he said. ''But we're not going to drop from $3,200 to $2,200. You can't walk into a Honda dealership and walk out with a Mercedes. And most people know there's a difference between a prime neighborhood and a secondary one.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Finn of Citi Habitats says the people attracted to the new developments include renters trading up from no-doorman buildings or walk-ups in the city. But he also says the new tenants are New Jersey or Queens residents who previously felt priced out of Manhattan. He said that the percentage of renters coming from outside Manhattan had increased to 30 percent from 20 percent in the last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But until new jobs are created to bring in a new pool of renters, it will continue to be a renter's market, said Marisa DiNatale, a director at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com. ''You won't see pricing power for landlords return until there's a strong recovery of the economy,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By most accounts, New York's employment outlook is better than initial predictions, but recession-generated job loss is still not expected to stop until mid-2010. The New York City Independent Budget Office has scaled back the anticipated job loss to 157,200, from 254,500, and predicts employment will start growing again this summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But some sectors, such as finance, we don't think are going to turn positive again until 2012,'' said Douglas Turetsky, the budget office's chief of staff. ''So even though we're going to start seeing new jobs in sectors like leisure and hospitality, what those jobs pay may not quite match the rent levels for the new buildings that are coming on line.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers and analysts have long predicted that many of the stalled construction projects around the city are condo buildings that will eventually be converted to rental buildings. But so far, few buildings have taken this step.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Scaglion of Rose said that 184 Kent was intended to be a condominium, but that the developer, JMH Development, decided to make it a rental during construction when it became clear that condos in the area were not selling well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Scaglion said, condo buildings for the most part are not easily turned into rentals because they have ''high-end finishes that don't wear well with rental tenants, and there's usually no back of house, no shop or staff to fix and renovate apartments.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor do most condo developers want to become rental owners; they would rather renegotiate their construction loans so that they can cut prices and sell out their projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephen Kotler, a director of rentals for Prudential Douglas Elliman, said that many developers of stalled projects had avoided foreclosure only because they had been able to keep current on their construction loans by spending ''interest reserves'' negotiated as part of their initial loan packages. ''But a lot of those reserves are going to start running out midyear,'' he said. ''And that's when you're going to see more condo projects becoming rentals.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some investors are betting that the wind will continue to blow in a renterly direction. A venture called Condominium Recovery was recently formed to buy distressed condo projects and rent them out for a minimum of three to four years before selling them as rental buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel and a partner in Condominium Recovery, says that the plan is to introduce about 2,500 new rental units to market starting in 2011. That is just a fraction of the city's estimated 22,000 ''shadow'' condo units: unfinished apartments in stalled buildings, or completed units not yet listed for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if other companies also convert condos into rentals, Mr. Miller said, the new inventory could ''continue to press rental prices down.'' Even so, he said, ''the three- to four-year outlook for New York City rentals for developers is still probably more favorable than the outlook for luxury condos.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Move-In Day Is Not Carved in Stone</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CONSTRUCTION delays are part and parcel of any new development, so it should come as no surprise that if you're signing a lease in a brand-new rental building, a firm move-in date can be elusive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers sometimes lease apartments before they have received final permits from the city. So if a building is still under construction, potential renters should ask whether the unit they hope to move into has a certificate of occupancy. If it doesn't, they should be prepared for delays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Brooklyn Gold, some renters were told that they could move in on Dec. 1, 2009, but that date has moved several times; the first move-in is now scheduled for Feb. 1. And at Avalon Fort Greene, move-in dates for about a dozen people were delayed by about a week late last year. Both buildings have compensated renters who were inconvenienced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frederick S. Harris, a senior vice president for development at <span class="companylink">AvalonBay Communities</span>, says that apartments are leased about a month in advance of the anticipated receipt of building department approval.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We had to push back the first group of people because the certificate of occupancy was later than predicted,'' Mr. Harris said. ''We try very hard to time it right, but when you're leasing in advance, sometimes you get it wrong.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOW wrong can you go for $2.25? That's the price of a packet of 20 tomato seeds from Baker Creek Heirloom Seeds. The variety I'm considering is called Furry Yellow Hog, and the catalog copy suggests that it has citrus notes and a four o'clock shadow, two traits I have never associated with a tomato.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Want to know more? That will not prove easy, because although there's a place for users to rate the Furry Yellow Hog seeds on the Baker Creek Web site, no one has yet done so. Which is understandable, given that the company sells 228 varieties of tomato.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At some point, consumer choice begins to feel oppressive. It's not about the money: Who would compare the value of a bumper tomato crop with the cost of a single subway fare? The problem is risk. What if the germinating seeds never awaken from their dirt nap? Or what if the tomatoes thrive, but taste like Play-Doh? Two hundred and twenty-eight varieties and I wasted a whole summer on a dud?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some gardeners revel in chance and the absurd abundance of botanical diversity. For the last few weeks, I've been calling them, looking for advice. Specifically, I asked these growers for thumbnail descriptions of a few favorite seeds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some respects, it's a ridiculous time to think about planting, as I couldn't penetrate my frozen yard without explosives. But the season for seed shopping is right about now. Last year, Fedco, the Maine catalog from which I placed my order, had sold out of some popular seed varieties by mid-February, as had other sellers. (Could boutique seeds be America's next speculative bubble?)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seeds these seasoned gardeners recommended flourished in their yards. But that doesn't mean they'll do a blessed thing in yours and mine. It's hope that springs eternal, not seeds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michele Owens</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ROOTS A founder of the Garden Rant blog (gardenrant.com), where gardeners mouth off with the zeal of sports radio barkers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOME TURF A 15-acre weekend house in Salem, N.Y., riding up on the Vermont border. Her 36-by-52-foot vegetable patch, Ms. Owens said, backs up to white pines and wild nettles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SEEDS OF SUCCESS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rosa Bianca eggplant While big, black eggplants sputter in Ms. Owens's northern climes, Rosa Bianca perseveres. Smallish and streaked lilac and white, the comely fruit has a ''melting texture,'' she said. Cook it, thinly sliced, under the broiler, drenched in olive oil and covered in sea salt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blue Coco bean Ms. Owens loves this ''exceptionally beautiful'' pole bean for its violet-colored flowers, heart-shaped leaves and purple beans. They are ''absurdly productive,'' she added, and somehow taste like summer. They are ''just crisper, fresher -- green bean-ier.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jarrahdale pumpkin During last year's freakish monsoon season, this blue-green pumpkin was a survivor. Its dense, creamy texture is ideal for pies, Ms. Owens said. And the pumpkin's thick walls help it to ''last and last'' in storage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Double Rose Peony poppy In Ms. Owens's experience, any variety of this ''spectacular'' opium relative will create hip-high stands of blue-green foliage with giant, succulent buds. ''Country wisdom is you take the seed and throw it out on the snow,'' she said. She favors the bare ground of a vegetable garden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pineapple tomato Fist-size, yellow-red and a little watery, this is an ''exceptionally sweet'' tomato, Ms. Owens said. Roast and then skin the halved tomatoes, saute with ''ridiculous amounts of garlic'' and serve with fresh rosemary over pasta. ''I would rather eat that than caviar,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rapa di Milano Colletto Viola turnip An Italian import, this Ping-Pong-ball-size turnip somehow adapted to ''the frigid bog I offer,'' Ms. Owens said. Beyond the table appeal of the root and the greens, this ''is one of the most beautiful plants I grow.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE NEW GUY Ms. Owens is tempted by the so-called Cannibal tomato eggplant, which the Baker Creek Heirloom Seeds catalog describes as ''shockingly bitter.'' Deal closer: ''It was reportedly used to make sauce for cannibal meals.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEVER AGAIN ''Can we just say watermelons are a constant heartbreak?'' Ms. Owens said. Yet two days later, by e-mail, she added: ''When it comes to my vegetable garden, I subscribe to the Winston Churchill philosophy: 'Never give in. Never, never, never, never -- in nothing, great or small.' ''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ROOTS Horticulturist and executive director of the United States Botanic Garden, on the National Mall in Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOME TURF A quarter-acre yard in Glen Echo, Md., along with a container roof garden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SEEDS OF SUCCESS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brussels winter chervil Dark green and ferny-looking, this cool-weather herb tastes best raw, in soups or garnishes. ''I snatched some seed from a friend's garden,'' Ms. Shimizu said, ''threw them in'' containers and ''I've never been as happy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calendula officinalis The two-inch-wide yellow flowers on this medicinal plant look good enough to eat. Go ahead, Ms. Shimizu said. Tinctures and teas made from it are thought to soothe the skin. New types of calendula carry multiple flowers; Ms. Shimizu prefers the single-flowered, herbal variety.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Holy basil Of the 20-odd basils Ms. Shimizu grows each year, she likes this fuzzy plant ''mostly for the fragrance.'' The name comes from its status as a sacred herb. ''If you travel in India,'' she said, ''you see it in a special tulsi container by the front door.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nutmeg plant (Nigella sativa) Despite the name, it's not nutmeg. Ms. Shimizu is fond of the plant's pale, papery flowers. But the seeds -- small and black -- hold the real appeal. They taste of violet, she said, on top of breads, desserts and puddings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moon vine (Ipmoea alba) This annual vine blooms in the evening, unfurling ''sparkling satin'' flowers that measure five inches across. Ms. Shimizu is particularly enchanted by the ''heavenly'' smell, which ''attracts beautiful garden moths'' through the night. She recommends soaking the hard seeds in hot water for better germination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Exotic Love vine (Mina lobata) Of course, Ms. Shimizu loves the name. She also loves the bicolored flowers, with their coral tips and ''creamy yellow'' insides, which can stick around as late as December. And she especially loves the swooning hummingbirds that come to call.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE NEW GUY Ms. Shimizu ordered Benary's Giant Deep Red zinnia as another hummingbird aphrodisiac. She'll be starting them on the windowsill, before moving them to containers on the ''very sunny edges'' of her porch.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ROOTS Horticulturist, and outreach educator for GreenBridge, the community horticulture program of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOME TURF Ms. Thomas shares a bedraggled Victorian with four housemates in the Kensington neighborhood of Brooklyn. The 24-by-40-foot garden plot is shady; the house hogs the southern sunlight. With five fervent gardeners digging around, it's also crowded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SEEDS OF SUCCESS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bush Delicata squash In the spirit of so many city residents, this bush-shaped plant gets by in cramped quarters. Ms. Thomas builds a 4-by-4-foot cage for it out of scavenged wood. It's also resistant to powdery mildew, a common squash scourge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Black Krim tomato Unlike a lot of heftier heirlooms, this red-and-purple tomato couldn't be used as a medicine ball. Its relatively svelte profile means the fruit has ''more time to ripen on the vine,'' Ms. Thomas said, developing a full flavor before plunging to earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Red Russian kale Start it in a cold frame, or sow it directly in March, and you can be eating baby greens by late April. Ms. Thomas likes to raise three successive crops of this loose-leafed kale. Even then, pests like the white fly don't seem to find it. Their loss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Glaskins Perpetual rhubarb Not for the impatient. In its first year, every part of the plant is poisonous. Looks a little frightful, too: Ms. Thomas likens rhubarb to ''a crazy pink monster'' emerging from the ground. The second season yields edible stalks, which Ms. Thomas plucks for jam or chutney.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tall meadow rue (Thalictrum pubescens) This white or lavender wildflower has the profile of a runway model -- six feet tall and wispy -- and the temperament to match. Ms. Thomas recommends starting the fickle seeds in a greenhouse, or in a plastic-wrapped egg carton, on top of a warm fridge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Showy goldenrod (Solidago speciosa) A late bloomer, goldenrod has deep yellow flower clusters that attract monarch butterflies on their long commute to Mexico. When they descend in late September, ''you'll see hundreds of monarchs,'' Ms. Thomas said. ''Which is a neat sight, especially here in the city.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE NEW GUY With friends, Ms. Thomas has started growing mushrooms. A few weeks ago in a community garden in Bushwick, Brooklyn, she ''inoculated oak logs'' with mycelia (fungal filaments) to try to raise shiitakes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEVER AGAIN ''I've been dreaming about starting watermelons for about 20 years,'' Ms. Thomas said. But with a plodding 120-day growing season, the melons seem to feed critters first. This year, at last, the nightmare ends.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SEEDS OF SUCCESS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mokum carrot This cigar-shaped carrot has the ''sweetest flavor, the crunchiest texture,'' Mr. Kirschenbaum said. Not being terribly durable, this variety seldom turns up in the grocery, but it's widely adaptable to different growing regions, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Superschmelz kohlrabi Often, the edible bulbs of this cabbage cousin grow woody. Not the sweet, crispy Superschmelz, which also grows to extraterrestrial dimensions. Mr. Kirschenbaum has heard reliable reports of a 29-pound kohlrabi. If you see one bigger than that, bar the door.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gypsy pepper The Willamette Valley isn't pepper country. The cool nights inhibit yields, he said. Yet he has heard no complaints from the prolific Gypsy. Bullhorn-shaped, and chartreuse at first, this pepper sweetens as it turns orange, then red, like a toreador's cape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sun Gold tomato ''I have tasted probably thousands and thousands of different varieties of tomatoes,'' Mr. Kirschenbaum said. Sun gold -- an orange-yellow cherry tomato -- is his favorite. It's resistant to a few common wilts, Fusarium and Verticillium. For a full flavor wallop, he said, eat it right off the vine, at the hottest hour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Violet Podded Stringless pole bean With purple vines and stems, and purple-veined leaves, this climbing bean has the visual drama of a good church hat. They are purple, too, Mr. Kirschenbaum said, until you steam them. Then, in a flash of magic, they turn green.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">King's High Scent sweet pea Mr. Kirschenbaum has plenty of gardening in his life, thank you, but this light lavender flower is one that he takes home from work. ''They are the best-smelling things I have ever smelled in my life,'' he said. He likes to trellis the climbing vines beneath his bedroom, then open the window when June's blooms roll in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE NEW GUY The German butterball potato may not be a true seed. But Mr. Kirschenbaum hopes the yellow-fleshed heirloom variety will be the equivalent of a three-sport athlete: suited to bake, fry or mash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEVER AGAIN Okra. It ''just likes a lot more heat than we can provide it,'' he said. ''If I'm lucky, I'll get one pod of okra per plant. I can imagine someone in Louisiana seeing that thing and laughing me out of the farm.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pam Peirce</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ROOTS Author of ''Golden Gate Gardening'' and a horticulture teacher at the City College of San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOME TURF Ms. Peirce's ''shady and foggy'' yard in San Francisco, overlooking the Bay, is given over to herbs and greens. She also tills a 100-square-foot plot in a community garden and grows a demonstration garden at the college.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SEEDS OF SUCCESS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Costata Romanesco summer squash Ms. Peirce praises this ridged and striped squash for the speed of its growth. At pollination, the zucchinis can be 6 to 8 inches long -- perhaps twice the typical early squash size. Yet they remain tender at a foot's length. Shred, add egg and flour, and fry for a genuine veggie burger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Juliet tomato Amid a ''depressing'' summer of blighted, blackened tomato plants, the Juliet hung on. ''The flavor wasn't remarkable,'' Ms. Peirce said of the two-inch-long tomato. ''But it sure did make a lot of fruit.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yellow Garden cosmos The color of these daisy-shaped flowers is different from that of most cosmos: pale yellow instead of pink or white. And ''if you clip off the spent flowers,'' Ms. Peirce said, ''they'll bloom all summer.'' Like a vampire, they're tough to kill; unlike a vampire, they like full sunlight and a wooden stake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lavatera trimestris (Silver Cup) ''Despite its name,'' Ms. Peirce said, the flower on this bushy sun-loving plant ''is bright pink.'' Lavatera Silver Cup makes a fine cutting flower, she added, with new buds opening as old ones fade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dwarf morning glory, Blue Ensign Though it sprawls, and it doesn't do much in a vase, the long-lasting flowers are charmers, with bright blue petals, a yellow center and bands of white. ''There's something that's right,'' Ms. Peirce said. ''You look and you say, 'Yes, that's what a flower should be!' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alaska nasturtium The Victorians had a quirky affection for ball-shaped little plants like this one, Ms. Peirce said. The orange-and-yellow flowers are edible, as are the white variegated leaves, which she likes to arrange over greens in a fussy, decorative manner. ''You find yourself saying, 'I'm actually placing leaves face-up on the salad.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE NEW GUY Ms. Peirce actually planted Millionaire eggplant last summer -- and then abandoned it in a gallon pot until early July. And yet, ''those darn things were setting fruits on my back porch,'' she said. This year, the eggplant will get a millionaire's berth.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SEEDS OF SUCCESS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Zealand spinach ''It's not related to any edible plant that I know of,'' Ms. Hall said -- including spinach. That's a good thing, because few other greens thrive in Los Angeles dry heat like this low-growing ground cover, she said. Also unusual are the triangular seeds, which Ms. Hall compared with ''shark eggs.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nero de Toscana kale Ms. Hall planted these seeds last October for the kale's dark, sweet greens. More than a year later, the indomitable plant stands four feet tall, she said, with ''a trunk a couple of inches around.'' Though kale is commonly cooked, Ms. Hall prefers it raw, with chopped apples.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Red orach This leafy green will self-sow in temperate Los Angeles. ''If you don't cut the seed head off,'' she said, ''it will grow the next year. I like easy, lazy gardeners' tricks like that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sugar Ann snap pea How to cook this miniature pea? Ms. Hall has no idea. ''They never make it inside because they're my favorite plant to graze on,'' she said. It's perfect for pots, as this snap pea grows only to a foot and doesn't need trellising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crimson California poppy ''I planted them in my front yard a few years ago as a kind of attempt to create a poppy field,'' Ms. Hall said. A few years later, that's exactly what she has. Passers-by gawk at the red-tipped flowers, which open in March, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Verbena bonariensis Heat tolerant and a thrifty sipper, this three-foot-high shrub has slender stems and purple flower clusters. An annual most places, it's a perennial in her yard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE NEW GUY ''I'm interested in trying some greens that have red leaves, or maroon, or purple, just to make my vegetable garden more colorful,'' Ms. Hall said. She is hoping that red-leafed bok choy will do the trick.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home construction slowed more than expected in December, the government said on Wednesday, as high unemployment made builders nervous about the demand for new homes. Still, there were signs that future construction might pick up, helped by the lure of a government tax credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders broke ground on homes at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 557,000 units in December, down 4 percent from November. Economists attributed much of the decline, which was concentrated in single-family homes, to unusually cold and wet weather last month in some regions of the country. They said weak demand from consumers, who remain reluctant to take on mortgages, also played a role.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts expect construction to steadily increase through the first part of 2010. Building permits -- an indicator of future construction -- rose 10.9 percent in December, to an annual rate of 653,000, the highest level in a year. That far outpaced expectations, and it followed a 6.9 percent increase in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surge indicated that builders are expecting a tax credit for first-time home buyers, which expires on April 30, to help drive demand in the coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're on the way to recovery,'' said Patrick Newport, an economist for IHS Global Insight. ''We can expect to see sustained increases and the pace picking up over the course of the year.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the market for homes remains extraordinarily feeble. Construction levels are about 75 percent lower than their highs in 2006, prices are deteriorating in many cities and high unemployment will probably continue to temper demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those dreary conditions were underscored when December's data was compared with the previous year: the pace of construction climbed only 0.2 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, construction of apartment complexes showed signs of life, climbing 12.2 percent from November, to an annual rate of 101,000. Apartment construction has reached record lows amid a broader crisis in commercial real estate. Builders were struggling to secure loans for large residential projects, which banks consider risky. In addition, demand for rented space has weakened as families move in together to save money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Assuming the recovery does not falter, home construction is expected to rise as inventories dwindle and consumers grow more confident about making large purchases. The government's credit for first-time home buyers has helped prop up sales, but prices remain stubbornly low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report released on Wednesday showed that inflation appeared to be tame in the United States. Producer prices increased slightly in December, up 0.2 percent from November, as a drop in energy prices offset a rise in food prices. A measure of prices that excludes volatile food and energy was flat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists generally agree that inflation will not emerge as a serious threat in the near term, but some are concerned about pockets of price increases. Food prices, for instance, were a central contributor to a 4.4 percent rise in producer prices in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, food prices were up 1.4 percent. That increase was probably not a result of unusual weather -- higher prices were mostly in meat and dairy, rather than in fruits and vegetables.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The current pick-up in headline inflation, although only likely to be temporary, is another drag on real incomes,'' researchers at Capital Economics wrote in a note on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report on consumer prices released last week showed a similar pattern: prices on a wide variety of goods were up only slightly in December. Taken together, the reports suggested that the Fed was unlikely to change interest rates anytime soon. It is scheduled to meet next week.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was in the community room on the ground floor of 1520 Sedgwick Avenue in the West Bronx that a young D.J. and his turntables helped to invent hip-hop, the music that spawned a global culture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A generation later, eyes again turned to the hulking brick tower overlooking the Harlem River when tenants, politicians and housing advocates fought to keep the building in a state-run rent-protection program and out of the hands of real estate investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They lost the battle, and the building was sold in 2008. Now, more than a year later, housing code violations have piled up, and tenants are seething at the new landlords. Advocates and analysts say that the building's problems could be a harbinger of a housing crisis in the city's low-income neighborhoods, especially in the Bronx.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here, it is not individual homes that are most under threat of foreclosure -- it is whole apartment buildings occupied by hundreds of families. And it was not the residents who took out the heavy loans -- it was investors who live far from the overleveraged properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While banks and owners seek to recoup staggering losses from overly optimistic real estate deals in neighborhoods like the South Bronx, Washington Heights and Corona, Queens, tenants have been left with some of the worst of the bust: crumbling buildings, rats and roaches, the threat of foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the new owners took over at 1520 Sedgwick Avenue in the fall of 2008, the number of violations has jumped to 598 from 82, an increase of more than 600 percent, according to the Department of Housing Preservation and Development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Because it was well maintained and families decided to stay there, relationships grew and it ended up leading to one of the most important cultural contributions in decades,'' said Dina Levy, director of organizing and policy at the Urban Homesteading Assistance Board, a tenant advocacy group. ''If that were to fall apart, it would be an indicator of what's going to happen to communities that are stable in the outer boroughs.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For decades 1520 Sedgwick, which has 102 units, was a much-desired, affordable address for working-class families. When Sylvia Jones moved there in 1997, she said, the lobby was so well maintained that ''you could see your face in the floor.'' She remembers Christmas parties, Halloween trick-or-treating, back-to-school drives. ''We were like a family in there,'' Ms. Jones said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Clive Campbell, otherwise known as D.J. Kool Herc, held the much-celebrated hip-hop parties in the community room in the early 1970s -- parties many see as crucial to the early evolution of hip-hop -- the whole building was invited.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, a ride in the building's lurching elevator provides a glimpse of current conditions. It is far from the worst of buildings. But the testimony can be powerful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mordistine Alexander, on the 15th floor, said that for three months she had to use a screwdriver to enter her apartment because the lock was broken and no one ever showed up to fix it. Mary Fountain, on the sixth floor, complained of a crack in her bedroom wall, saying, ''I can look through and see the sunshine.'' Barbara Griles, on the 13th floor, said she planned to move out after 17 years because her toilet flooded her living room, the building's floors were dirty and ''when you ask for service, you don't get it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the height of the boom, real estate investors, many of whom were backed by private equity funds, paid top dollar for as many as 120,000 apartments across the city, most of which were either rent-regulated or were in buildings that had recently been removed from the state's Mitchell-Lama housing program, which had kept rents relatively low, according to the Department of Housing Preservation and Development. But the market collapsed, and the new residents willing to pay higher rents never came, leaving the buildings overleveraged and vulnerable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 300 of those buildings were in the Bronx, and at least 40 are in foreclosure, according to the University Neighborhood Housing Program. About 100 more buildings in the borough are at risk, the Urban Homesteading Assistance Board says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neglect has spurred some tenants to stage protests outside the banks that hold the mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others became so fed up with the unresponsive management and the deteriorating conditions that they left the building, or even the borough. About a dozen tenants have moved from 1520 Sedgwick or are planning to, according to the tenants' association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decision to leave carries a special resonance in the Bronx. The fires of the 1970s that turned neighborhoods to rubble began as landlords neglected their properties and middle-class families fled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We in New York have definitely seen this movie before,'' said Rafael E. Cestero, the commissioner of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development. ''The combination of financial distress leading to severe physical distress in these buildings impacts the neighborhoods, and it has a ripple effect that risks destabilizing neighborhoods that we have all spent so much time rebuilding.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cestero divides the city's overleveraged buildings into three categories. There are about 4,000 apartments, mostly in the Bronx and Washington Heights, with terrible physical and financial problems that have left tenants in housing nightmares. There are at least 90,000 apartments burdened with debt but not in immediate danger of collapse. In between sit some 16,000 apartments at risk, teetering between stability and disrepair. The Sedgwick Avenue building is in this category: Advocates say it can still be saved, but tenants see signs of trouble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 20 residents have filed a lawsuit against the owners of the building, 1520 Sedgwick NY LLC, and the company that manages it, citing the deteriorating conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Azi Mandel, director of Treetop Development, which controls the management firm, called the tenants' complaints overblown and said the violations had been addressed. ''The building is immaculate at all times,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Karasick, a prominent real estate investor who was part of the group that bought the building, did not return several phone messages. His lawyer, Steven I. Holm, declined to comment because of the pending litigation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Mr. Karasick began negotiating to buy 1520 Sedgwick Avenue, housing advocates were puzzled as to why he would be interested in working-class housing stock in the Bronx. Years earlier, Mr. Karasick's investment group sold the iconic Bank of America Center in San Francisco for more than $1 billion to a group that included Donald Trump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Karasick was part of a flood of investors who turned from familiar areas like Midtown Manhattan to gritty neighborhoods uptown, betting big that the wave of gentrification washing across the city would reach the Bronx.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2007, Mr. Karasick and a group of investors bought two other Bronx buildings, Robert Fulton Terrace and Fordham Towers, after the previous owners removed the buildings from the Mitchell-Lama program, which allows landlords to receive tax breaks and subsidized mortgages in exchange for limiting their return on equity and keeping rents low. Both buildings are now in foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The purchase of the Sedgwick building was so controversial that city officials initially tried to stop the sale, saying that the financing was not viable. Senator Charles E. Schumer and Representative Jose E. Serrano, among others, rallied behind the tenants' unsuccessful bid to buy the building, and tried to keep the building in the Mitchell-Lama program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tenant advocates and many city officials watched the flurry of sales in some parts of the Bronx and other poor areas with alarm. The rent rolls would not support the high sale prices, they argued, which meant the owners would either force out low-income tenants or slash the buildings' services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everything has panned out exactly as our worst fears, and that's pretty scary,'' said Ms. Levy of the Urban Homesteading Assistance Board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Geraldine Davis, a resident of 1520 Sedgwick Avenue for more than 30 years, said that drug dealers had flowed into the building because the locks on the lobby doors were often broken. She pointed to a wide crack in her 13th-floor terrace and uncollected garbage in the trash chute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm mad up to here,'' said Ms. Davis, 70, who raised her two children in the building. ''Everything has gone downhill. And everything is getting worse.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Miss Gerry,'' as she is known to all, prowls the lobby and the laundry room, checking in on everyone's grievances about the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She is determined to preserve the life and community she nurtured for decades. Last month, she decorated the hallway outside her door with Christmas streamers, as she does every year. In her apartment, her teddy bears sit alert on her bed. Ms. Davis has watched several of her friends move to better buildings, but she said she would stay, partly because she has no choice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The ones that can afford it are leaving,'' she said, traces of a Southern accent from her Florida childhood in her voice. ''But not everyone can afford it. I don't have a place to go. I can't afford to move.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sylvia Jones, who had spent most of her life in the Bronx, had lived at 1520 Sedgwick Avenue for 10 years when the building went up for sale. She said she knew what would follow, and she knew she had to leave.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The building just starts going down, and the people just stop caring,'' she said. ''Eventually the only people going to be left in that building are the poor people who have Section 8. They're not going to go anywhere until the building just collapses.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Jones, 60, packed up her things in 2007, before the new management took over, and moved to Monticello, N.Y., a town about 90 miles north of the city. She is adjusting to a new life, even learning to drive. On a recent afternoon, she clutched her car's steering wheel in a death grip, inching down the empty streets of her adopted town, cringing at the thought of mountain roads at night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back on Sedgwick Avenue, Ms. Davis and her neighbors worry about how much worse the building will get. They compare notes and discuss strategies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Davis has a message for the landlords. ''I was here before you bought this building,'' she said, ''and I'm going to be here when you lose this building.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Southern California authorities have ordered the evacuation of more than 60 homes because of heavy rains in a neighborhood just below an area scarred by the huge Station Fire last summer. Officials feared a number of foothill areas along the San Gabriel Mountains north of Los Angeles could be threatened by mudslides after a catch basin filled with sliding mud and debris. Elsewhere, more than 12,000 Southern California residents in Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties lost power because of the heavy winter storm that could bring up to 1.25 inches of rain an hour.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article on Monday about the declining fortunes of the Plaza Hotel in New York misspelled the surname of a part owner of the Oak Room, one of the Plaza's restaurants. He is Joey Allaham, not Alaham.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Thu Jan 21 2010</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When an Israeli billionaire bought New York's storied Plaza Hotel for $675 million, he envisioned turning the plucky grande dame with the globally recognized name into mainly a luxury condo tower that would cater to the world's wealthiest buyers and offer stores to satisfy their every desire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now, six years later, with the city in an acute recession, the grandest aims of the new owner, Isaac Tshuva, and the excitement of the new Plaza's first residents seem to have dimmed, according to sales data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last 11 owners to sell their luxury condos at the Plaza Hotel sold them at a loss, including the owner of Apartment 409, which sold for $8.5 million less than it cost 16 months before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Plaza's underground luxury stores are struggling to attract shoppers, and one expert broker is consequently advising clients not to take space there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And this spring, steps below where F. Scott Fitzgerald found his muse for ''The Great Gatsby,'' the hotel is opening an upscale food court offering burgers and pizza. The Palm Court, the Plaza's famous restaurant, has been closed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's gone from being a landmark to being just a building,'' Clark Wolf, an independent restaurant consultant, said of the situation. ''In an era without a Tavern on the Green or a Cafe des Artistes, we need something. New York City is screaming for a landmark.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the 102-year-old Plaza still has cachet. To many New Yorkers and tourists, the Plaza is still the place where Eloise, the fictional 6-year-old, treats the hotel as her playground, and Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman share late-afternoon drinks at the Oak Bar. And the Plaza's overall financial picture means little to prospective brides: The Grand Ballroom is still booked every Saturday night in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the heady first couple of years after Mr. Tshuva acquired the Plaza in 2004, he reaped the rewards of a real estate boom. After a $450 million makeover was complete, Mr. Tshuva's real estate firm sold all 181 units sight unseen for a total of more than $1.3 billion. The prices for these apartments were so high that real estate brokerage firms started separating the Plaza's sales figures from their overall data reporting because they distorted the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Tshuva would also fight with the hotel union, battle with the owners of the rights to Eloise's image and even endure cries of protest about the possible loss of the Plaza. The actress Sarah Jessica Parker held her 40th birthday party there in a show of support for the hotel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to data tracked by Streeteasy.com, Earl McEvoy, a mutual fund manager who paid $4.79 million for an apartment in October 2007, sold it last summer for $4 million. Guy Wildenstein, president of the Wildenstein &amp;Company gallery on the Upper East Side and owner of a large private art collection, sold Apartment 409, and another unit he bought in August 2008 for $9.6 million went for $6 million 15 months later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there was Oscar S. Schafer, a managing partner at the hedge fund O.S.S. Capital Management, who took a hit on No. 1709. He bought the three-bedroom unit for $14.6 million in May 2008 and sold it for $8.5 million in July 2009. And 9 of the 28 apartments in the building on the market have slashed their asking prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some context: Lawyers and brokers say that 15 Central Park West, a new property whose condos were sold at roughly at the same time as the Plaza's, had its last 10 transactions sell for well over their asking price. Edward Mermelstein, a real estate lawyer who represented more than two dozen buyers of apartments at the Plaza and 15 Central Park West, said that since both properties opened, his clients preferred 15 Central Park West apartments for its bigger windows and bigger-name residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is possible, then, that his buyers want to live near the chief executive of <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> at 15 Central Park West, not the former chief executive of <span class="companylink">Bear Stearns</span> at the Plaza.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You have the perception at this point that 15 Central Park West is very much a private club,'' Mr. Mermelstein said. ''The Plaza has very much of a feeling of a hotel.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even the most serious skeptics of the relative value of the Plaza condos say that once the residential real estate slowdown passes, the building will be desirable to some buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With its uniqueness in the world, and its name in the world, it's going to be a sought-after address,'' said Noel Berk, a real estate broker who lives in and has sold apartments at 15 Central Park West. ''The Plaza is the Plaza.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the central struggles at the Plaza involves the shopping center Mr. Tshuva's firm, Elad Properties, created in the hotel's basement. It now includes several luxury retailers like the Viennese patisserie Demel, Maurice Fine Jewelry and Krigler perfumes. But a shirt maker, Eton of Sweden, has closed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alan Victor, president of the retail brokerage firm Lansco, said that while two of his brokers made deals there, he was advising clients not to set up shop there because of the location off Fifth Avenue and the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's just too risky to put our tenants there,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plaza executives responsible for the hotel and events divisions say that while the market has been tough, it is slowly getting better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Business for events booked in the Grand Ballroom dropped 20 percent in 2009, from 2008, said Liz Neumark, principal of CPS Events, which has a 25-year lease to manage the hotel's event spaces. She credits the drop to a decline in corporate meetings and the tighter budgets of nonprofit organizations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shane Krige, general manager of the 282-room hotel that still operates at the Plaza, said that occupancy for hotel rooms followed similar trends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Plaza executives also see some hopeful signs. Ms. Neumark predicts a 30 percent jump in wedding bookings this year. The hotel's occupancy rate rose to 90 percent in December, according to Mr. Krige. The hotel also just received its first five-diamond rating from AAA, and several princes and princesses stayed there last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It remains to be seen whether the mix of restaurants in the building will meet the standards of truly highbrow guests. The Edwardian Room remains closed except for private events. The Palm Court, which reopened briefly, closed again in December 2008. Mr. Krige said that Fairmont, which manages the hotel, plans to reopen the Palm Court this spring, and he is posting job openings there. The Oak Bar, the Oak Room, the Champagne Bar and the Rose Club remain open.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The celebrity chef Todd English is sorting out construction details for a 5,400-square-foot food hall next to the basement stores. Mr. English's spokeswoman on this project, Willie Norkin, dismissed any questions that the market's food offerings -- they will range from sushi to dumplings to pizza -- may not be up to the Plaza's reputation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't think the goal here is to have offerings that are going to be exclusive,'' she said. ''It's going to have offerings that are inclusive and appealing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joey Alaham, a part owner in the Oak Room and owner of three other restaurants, said that even in the face of the recession, there is a history about the Plaza that still draws customers. He described a 97-year-old man who recently visited the Oak Bar. He ordered a Macallan Scotch and gazed at the newly restored murals around him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''His wife passed away,'' Mr. Alaham said. ''He came in to remember their first date.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JAMES P. GORMAN, a 6-foot-2 Australian, recently took up boxing lessons, in keeping with some of the trappings of his Midtown Manhattan office. On one wall, opposite an inspirational poem by Rudyard Kipling (''The Thousandth Man''), hangs a photograph of Elvis Presley sparring with Muhammad Ali.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have a lot of respect for Ali,'' says Mr. Gorman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the new chief executive of <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>, an investment bank that narrowly escaped the financial smackdown that destroyed many of its competitors, Mr. Gorman may have to get ready for some fisticuffs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is tasked with overhauling a firm that put a primacy on high-risk trading under his predecessor, John J. Mack, and one that has spent the last several years often riven by factional disputes and internal debates over strategy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under Mr. Mack, <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> made errant mortgage bets and commercial property gambles that cost it billions of dollars and almost destroyed it. The firm was saved by a $10 billion bailout from the federal government, since repaid, and by Asian investors who wrested a large stake in the firm in exchange for cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During Mr. Mack's tenure, from 2005 to the end of last year, the stock price fell 32 percent. And the firm, which will celebrate its 75th anniversary this year, is expected to announce this week the first annual loss in its history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is no question there have been rough spots,'' Mr. Gorman said, in his first interview since becoming chief executive on Jan. 1. ''We have had periods of management turmoil, misplaced trading positions. We have invested in real estate at the wrong end of the market. Clearly there were some mistakes made, but you can't be in a complex global bank and not have mistakes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added that the bank now had ''a sense of clarity about what we want to be'' -- and that it wouldn't be trading with large amounts of its own capital. ''We are a very focused investment bank,'' he said, ''very client-centered.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gorman, 51, will have to prove that the steadier, more diversified bank he hopes to build -- with less megatrading and more advisory work for clients -- can still take on more aggressive Wall Street titans like <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> or <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span>, rivals that thus far have navigated the crisis more successfully.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gorman says that Morgan will eventually begin taking bigger risks and wagering more money to do so, but that it will avoid big, concentrated bets on complex products that few people understand -- and that have the potential to blow up an institution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are still taking risks,'' he says, but ''we will not have the outsize risk positions that will endanger the firm.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some analysts remain tentative about <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>'s prospects in a financial landscape littered with corporate wreckage and dominated by a handful of wily survivors. While the firm's traditional investment banking franchise has emerged strongly from the crisis -- topping <span class="companylink">JPMorgan</span> and Goldman in some of its businesses -- it has shrunk its fixed-income division and taken piles of money off the table in its broader institutional securities business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Guy Moszkowski, an analyst at Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch, notes that <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> has about $17 billion in capital committed to its institutional securities business, compared with his estimate of around $40 billion at Goldman and $33 billion at <span class="companylink">JPMorgan</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the last few years, ''they seemed to hang back from risk-taking even at times when they could get paid richly,'' Mr. Moszkowski says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Then they pushed themselves forward when the party was already ending,'' he adds. ''<span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> lagged again last year. The net result is they zigged when they should have zagged. There is an issue in that they have fallen behind their peers, though I believe they can resolve it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. GORMAN'S arrival at <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> is, of course, heavily informed by Mr. Mack's track record. Mr. Mack, who is staying on as chairman and will continue to occupy his old office, inspired fierce loyalty among his traders but ultimately drew mixed reviews as a manager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mack, 65, had spent most of his career at <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> and was one of the architects of its 1997 merger with the brokerage firm Dean Witter. The chief executive of Dean Witter, Philip J. Purcell, outmaneuvered Mr. Mack for control of Morgan in the following years. Mr. Mack left in 2001, ushering in an era of pitched battles between Purcell supporters and Mack loyalists who remained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After much to-and-fro, Mr. Purcell -- who pushed for less risk-taking at the firm but delivered lackluster financial results -- was forced out in 2005, and Mr. Mack made a triumphant return. And that is where the real debate on his performance begins, especially in light of the outsize losses <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> absorbed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''John really did do most of the things that the shareholders and some of the retired employees were hoping he would do,'' says Robert G. Scott, a former senior executive at the firm who was among those who successfully agitated for Mr. Mack's return. ''The C.E.O. is critical, but the people who are executing the strategy in various business units have a tremendous responsibility for the results, and the seeds for that underperformance were sown before John took over.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others, however, have a harsher view.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What's the legacy of John Mack?'' asks William D. Cohan, a former investment banker and the author of ''House of Cards,'' a best seller about the financial crisis. ''He nearly lost the firm by taking big risks. In the Mack era, a dirty little secret is that had they stuck to Purcell, they would not almost have gone out of business in 2008.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mack acknowledges some regrets about the course of his career -- that he never consummated a proposed merger of <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>'s asset management business with BlackRock, which has become one of the world's largest money managers, and that he never flushed out more senior managers when he returned in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There were things you just didn't know until you asked specific questions,'' he says. ''Certain positions were a lot older than anyone ever told me. When you come into an organization, you need fresh eyes. You don't need anyone who can defend what's been in place in the past.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But on his legacy he is clear, he says: he changed the firm for the better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Passionate, emotional, intuitive and a former bond trader, Mr. Mack worked hard to restore swagger and confidence to traders and others who believed that <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> lost its way under Mr. Purcell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After returning, Mr. Mack boasted of his renewed appetite for risk and pushed the firm into fashionable areas like subprime mortgages, commercial real estate and leveraged lending. To emulate other banks like Goldman, he advocated using the firm's own capital to pursue bigger, hairier trades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That strategy worked at first -- 2006 was a record year -- but <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>'s swashbuckling wasn't backed up by adequate risk controls, a reality embodied by the biggest trading loss in its history and an event that more than any other may mark the Mack era.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loss came at a specialized trading shop housed inside the firm and run by a man named Howie Hubler, then in his mid-30s. Mr. Hubler's 50-person team correctly wagered $1.4 billion that the subprime mortgage market was weak and would become progressively worse, insight that paid off in 2006 and into early 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But to protect itself against possible losses on that trade, the team bought contracts that would enable it to profit if the subprime sector stabilized. Those latter bets proved extremely vulnerable, and as the mortgage market imploded -- setting off one of the worst economic crises in American history -- <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> was trapped. The firm ended up losing $10 billion on the wagers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A person familiar with the trade, who requested anonymity because of contractual obligations that prevent him from speaking about the firm, said the unit was never a rogue operation and that many of <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>'s leaders were aware of its activities and approved of them, including the group's proposals to wind down the position.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the firm was slammed by losses on direct commercial property investments, like Crescent Real Estate, a $6.5 billion portfolio of urban office properties that it bought at the peak of the boom in 2007. Last November, facing defaults on borrowing tied to the portfolio, <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> surrendered it to <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span>. For the first three quarters of 2009, <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> booked real estate losses of $2.1 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mack says the firm took on such risks because everyone else on Wall Street was doing it, too. ''Did I have too much leverage?'' he says. ''Yes. But the whole industry did.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He says that some of the trading positions were put on the books in the Purcell years and that <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>'s chief risk officer didn't report directly to him, which prevented crucial information from reaching his office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mack responded to the trading debacle by ousting his protege, Zoe Cruz, the firm's co-president, who was in charge of the institutional securities group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an unusual gesture on Wall Street, Mr. Mack has taken some responsibility for his mistakes by forgoing a bonus for the last three years. In Congressional testimony last week, he said he was an advocate of greater regulation because of the threats to the financial system that he saw during the crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also shuttered all but one of <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>'s proprietary trading desks and ousted some senior executives in its real estate businesses. And, rather than bowing to regulatory demands that he sell the firm, Mr. Mack strengthened <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>'s balance sheet by selling a chunk of the firm to the Asian investors. That move, as well as taxpayer largess in the form of federal bailout money, kept it from collapsing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, for all of this, Mr. Mack arguably made another mistake after the worst of the crisis's initial stages had passed -- by dialing back risk-taking too far. Rivals like <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> took advantage of the reduced number of competitors to ring up record trading profits last year, windfalls that <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> missed out on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We were probably too conservative,'' concedes Mr. Mack. ''But we had not built out enough of a platform in sales and trading.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Waiting in the wings as all of these financial dramas played out was Mr. Gorman, a former lawyer from Melbourne who was one of Mr. Mack's first major hires when he returned to the firm in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CEREBRAL, circumspect and analytical, Mr. Gorman's style contrasts with Mr. Mack's brasher, more intuitive approach -- a telling reminder of just how much the financial crisis has traumatized <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> and the extent to which the bank's board, and Mr. Mack himself, recognize the need for a calm, risk-conscious hand at the tiller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1987, after receiving an M.B.A. from Columbia's Graduate School of Business, Mr. Gorman joined the consulting giant McKinsey, where, among other things, he was a member of the financial services practice. In 1999, David H. Komansky, then the chief executive of <span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span>, recruited Mr. Gorman as its marketing chief. Mr. Gorman describes Mr. Komansky -- who, not unlike Mr. Mack, is a larger-than-life figure -- as his first mentor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He told me: One, stay grounded; two, don't underestimate the importance of personal relationships inside and outside the firm,'' Mr. Gorman says of Mr. Komansky. ''And three, if someone is doing the wrong thing, no matter how big a producer they are, they are out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. GORMAN eventually oversaw Merrill's global private client business and made many changes he would later employ at <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> -- segmenting the market and focusing on wealthier clients. A former Merrill colleague described him as a quick study and unafraid of internal battles with Mr. Komansky's successor, E. Stanley O'Neal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He was not always focused on the political ramifications of something,'' says this person, who requested anonymity because of contractual obligations that prevent him from speaking about Merrill. ''I watched him in a tug of war with O'Neal and not let it go. If he thinks something is right, he is going to dig in. This is a good thing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Friction with Mr. O'Neal primed Mr. Gorman to accept Mr. Mack's invitation in 2005, a call that came partially at the recommendation of Laurence D. Fink, the chief executive of BlackRock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He understands how to bring culture to an organization,'' says Mr. Fink. ''He can talk about the high-level strategy and understands the details of the business.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>, Mr. Gorman led the global wealth management division and tied up a number of loose ends from the Dean Witter merger: replacing 27 of the top 30 managers, removing the 2,000 least productive financial advisers, unifying all of the firm's retail business under one name, streamlining technology systems, overhauling marketing and focusing on wealthier clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gorman worked from <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>'s offices in Purchase, N.Y. Once a week, Mr. Mack, who lives nearby in Rye, would go to the gym and then stop by for an 8:30 a.m. meeting with Mr. Gorman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to having valuable face time with Mr. Mack, Mr. Gorman also lavished praise on his boss: in Mr. Mack's office hangs a printed, signed and framed e-mail message from Mr. Gorman, richly complimenting Mr. Mack for his leadership during the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such overt gestures haven't given Mr. Gorman the reputation of being a toady. Many around the office describe him as ''nice'' and ''decent.'' Or, as one of his senior colleagues puts it, Mr. Gorman is ''definitely not a slimeball.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the trading losses in 2007, Mr. Gorman became co-president. The firm also put him in charge of thinking about long-term strategy with its chief financial officer. During the crisis, Mr. Gorman argued forcefully for a big strategic shift, with an emphasis on cutting complex products and expanding retail brokerage services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To that end, Mr. Gorman pushed <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> to pay $2.75 billion last year to acquire a 51 percent stake in Smith Barney, the big brokerage firm owned by <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span>, another struggling financial behemoth. <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> hopes to take full control of Smith Barney by 2014. The takeover gives it about 18,000 financial advisers and one of the biggest wealth management businesses in the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Howard Chen, an analyst at <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span>, history may decide that <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> bought Smith Barney ''for a song.'' The deal was certainly transformative. The retail business now makes up 35 percent of <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>'s total revenue (compared with 57 percent for its traditional institutional business), up from about a quarter share before the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHATEVER its long-term merits, the deal did little to reverse <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>'s sagging fortunes. Around the middle of last year, with the share price lagging, Mr. Mack confirmed previous plans to step down. Mr. Gorman won the race to succeed him, in part because the firm's board, which voted unanimously for him, was impressed by his strategic abilities and work he had done turning around the retail business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The board liked that Mr. Gorman wanted to strengthen <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>'s institutional securities group and reduce risk-taking, says Robert Kidder, a director.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We concluded that James was decisive, strategic and had knowledge of a range of the firm's activities,'' says Mr. Kidder. ''We believed he was the kind of person who would build a strong and strategic team over time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to another person familiar with the board's thinking, who requested anonymity because the deliberations were confidential, Mr. Gorman's calm demeanor offered a marked and welcome break from Mr. Mack's more volatile temperament.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite his embrace of plain-vanilla retail enterprises, Mr. Gorman says that the firm's core business remains its investment banking and institutional sales and trading -- and that the company's recovery won't be complete until those businesses are nursed back to health. To buttress its risk management capabilities, <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> has started what it calls Project Phoenix, which will measure and monitor proper risk-return ratios across the company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some analysts still have concerns. Institutional Risk Analytics, a research firm, recently gave <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>'s shares a negative rating ''because of the bank's poor financial performance, low levels of tangible common equity and failure to make any significant disclosure regarding off-balance-sheet exposures.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> says that it has healthy levels of common equity and that it discloses details of its off-balance-sheet exposures. It points out that three other analysts upgraded their ratings of the firm this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some analysts wonder whether Mr. Gorman has the investment banking and trading chops to rally the bank's core institutional troops, or whether his resemblance to Mr. Purcell -- who also began his career at McKinsey and rose to prominence in retail brokerage -- may be too limiting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I no more or less resemble Phil Purcell than any 5,000 people here,'' says Mr. Gorman. ''And a lot of people ran brokerages -- Sandy Weill, Jamie Dimon, David Komansky.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The money manager Barton Biggs, who spent 30 years at <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> before leaving in 2003 to run his own company, says he thinks the mood at Morgan is upbeat. ''People respect Gorman as being a different person than John,'' he says. ''He is not a mingler. He is not going to walk the trading floor, slapping backs. But he is a first-rate intellect and he impresses with his organization and his thoughtfulness.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STANDING in his office recently, Mr. Gorman flips through sheets of corporate contacts he has made since his McKinsey days. He describes the back-to-back breakfasts, coffees and dinners he will be having with hedge fund managers and corporate titans over the next few weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a period of time when you are dealing with a lot of complicated constituencies -- regulators, shareholders, legislators, politicians, the media,'' he says. ''There are a lot of things in flux and you have to feel comfortable dealing with a lot of complexity, which I do.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Mr. Gorman continues to get his stride, he will have Mr. Mack peering over his shoulder as chairman for at least the next two years. Mr. Mack says he's looking forward to spending more time at his Tuscan vineyard and shows off a picture of himself standing beside Cher backstage in Las Vegas, as well as other mementos from a 40-year career. ''I really like my new role,'' he says. ''I didn't come to work until 9:30 today!''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some analysts wonder that if things turn sour, will Mr. Gorman find himself isolated in an institution where Mr. Mack's constituency is still powerful?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Listen, this would not work if I wasn't his man,'' says Mr. Gorman. ''We have a terrific relationship.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a recent afternoon, the two men posed in Mr. Gorman's doorway, arms around each other's shoulders, demonstrating their camaraderie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We do this every day,'' says Mr. Gorman, joking, while Mr. Mack smiles beside him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gorman acknowledges, however, that the alternative -- fighting with Mr. Mack -- would be a terrifying prospect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I would not box John,'' he says. ''He has big shoulders.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article last Sunday about Tishman Speyer Properties misidentified the adviser hired by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to negotiate a loan restructuring with Tishman Speyer over office buildings in Chicago. It is BlackRock, not the Blackstone Group. The article also misstated the size of a deal in which Tishman Speyer acquired Archstone Smith. It was $22.2 billion, not million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And a chart with the article referred incorrectly to the career of a New York Fed director, Kathryn S. Wylde. Although she is president and chief executive of the Partnership for New York City, she was not promoted to that post by Jerry I. Speyer, the chairman of Tishman Speyer and a former chairman of the Partnership. (Go to Article)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Sun Jan 24 2010</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IT seemed a great idea at the time. In June 2007, Jerry I. Speyer and his son Rob bought six buildings in Chicago, making them one of the largest commercial landlords in the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Speyers, who focus on prominent towers like Rockefeller Center and the Chrysler Building in Manhattan that are packed with blue-chip tenants, were elated. They had captured several buildings at the heart of Chicago's business district, including the sprawling Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the stately Civic Opera House.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But within weeks, nearly everything went wrong. The Speyers, who are co-chief executives of Tishman Speyer Properties, had counted on selling three of the buildings to pay down $1.4 billion in loans used to finance the deal. But they could unload only one. Soon, the commercial vacancy rate in Chicago climbed to 15 percent, and property values plummeted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the Speyers are in tough negotiations with a representative of the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of New York</span> to restructure the loans on the Chicago properties. If those talks fail, the ownership group led by Tishman Speyer could face foreclosure. The Fed inherited the debt in 2008 when <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span> bought the original lender, <span class="companylink">Bear Stearns</span>, and the government took on many of its troubled assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As it happens, Jerry Speyer was a director of the New York Fed from 2001 through 2007. The Federal Reserve, meanwhile, has hired the <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group</span> -- the very people who sold the assets to the Speyers in 2007 for a hefty profit -- to handle the negotiations on its behalf.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We clearly bought the real estate at the top of the market,'' Rob Speyer, 40, said in an interview at the company's Rockefeller Center offices. ''In retrospect, we overpaid.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much as they charged from deal to deal a few years ago, the Speyers are now shuttling from one troubled asset to the next. This month, a joint venture of Tishman Speyer and the investment firm BlackRock defaulted on a $3 billion mortgage for Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village in Manhattan. The partners' purchase of these huge apartment complexes in 2006 -- for $5.4 billion -- is now regarded as a high-water mark for an overheated, speculative market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tishman Speyer also has its hands full with two other sour deals: the $22.2 million acquisition of Archstone Smith, a company that owned 70,000 apartments, and the $2.8 billion purchase of CarrAmerica, which owned 26 office buildings in Washington, a city where vacancy rates have hit a record level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Anybody who bought property in the last six years has their equity pretty well washed out,'' said Ray Torto, chief economist at <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>, a real estate firm. ''People are looking back on that period as the peak of the madness, the bubble. The expectation was that there was always someone who would pay a higher price after you.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of rents and values rising unchecked, the value of commercial office buildings in the United States has dropped 43 percent, on average, since November 2007, according to economists' estimates. If unemployment continues to rise, an ugly situation could turn nightmarish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Caught in the same riptide as many of their competitors, the Speyers now spend much of their time locked in rooms with bankers. Lenders are deciding whether to restructure the loans by extending the term and offering lower interest (in return for more capital from the Speyers and their partners), or to simply foreclose and hope the assets will be worth more in coming years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE travails of the Speyers are not that different from those of other investors who poured ever-larger sums into real estate during that delirious period when every day seemed to bring another gigantic deal at a record-breaking price. But the Speyers' problems are unlikely to break the firm or mimic those of Harry Macklowe, whose debt-fueled, $7 billion acquisition of seven Manhattan office buildings ultimately sank much of his real estate empire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest risk the Speyers now face is to their reputation, not their bank accounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tishman Speyer manages a $33.5 billion portfolio of 72 million square feet of commercial space -- the rough equivalent of all the office space in Houston and Los Angeles combined -- on four continents. (Those numbers do not include residential properties like the Stuyvesant Town and Archstone apartments.) Most of the property is purchased with other people's money, be it the Crown family in Chicago, the government of Singapore, the Church of England or Calpers, the giant California pension fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors typically put their money into an investment fund established by the Speyers and expect, say, a 20 percent annual return. The fund, in turn, buys a series of properties or projects, with or without partners. Each deal involves a single-purpose entity or corporation to invest the equity and take on debt. This means that if the deal goes bad, the lenders can take back the property, but they cannot seize other assets owned by the fund or demand that Tishman Speyer make up for any losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tishman Speyer, which has no corporate debt, earns fees for developing and operating the buildings but usually puts little of its own money into a deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the $5.4 billion Stuyvesant Town deal, for instance, BlackRock and Tishman Speyer invested only $112 million each of their own money, which they have written off. Jerry and Rob Speyer personally contributed $56 million of Tishman's share. Real estate and bank executives say Tishman Speyer took $18 million a year in fees; company executives say they began waiving the fees in fall 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the question for companies like Tishman Speyer and others that helped orchestrate huge deals during the real estate boom isn't whether they'll go broke: it's whether investors and banks will so easily and unblinkingly put billions of dollars in their hands again after this carnage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a lot of big-name managers out there who have done a lot of damage to their reputations in the downturn,'' says Michael Kirby, director of research at Green Street Advisors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calpers, the nation's largest pension fund, has already cut ties with its longtime advisory firm, <span class="companylink">MacFarlane Partners</span>, and is likely to shed BlackRock as well, in part because its $500 million investment in the Stuyvesant Town deal is now worthless.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clark McKinley, a spokesman for Calpers, acknowledged that the pension fund had written off its investment at Stuyvesant Town and lost billions of dollars on property. ''We took some very tough medicine in real estate. It's been a hugely painful lesson,'' said Mr. McKinley, adding that Calpers was ''also evaluating manager relationships and taking appropriate action, including ending some partnerships.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Speyers argue that a few bad deals have to be put within a larger context for a company that has made money for its investors during good times and bad. Tishman Speyer sold $12 billion worth of buildings for enormous profit during a 12-month period in 2006 and 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Manhattan, that list includes the former headquarters of <span class="companylink">The New York Times Company</span>, a building that Tishman Speyer sold for $525 million in 2007, three times what it had paid 30 months earlier, and the landmark Lipstick Building, on Third Avenue at 53rd Street, which sold for $648 million, $413 million more than it paid in 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, Tishman Speyer is building 17 residential projects in Brazil and two developments in China. And it is sitting on $2 billion in cash for new deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''After writing off the equity in a handful of distressed deals, our annual returns on both a 10-year and a 30-year basis are over 20 percent, on average,'' Rob Speyer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE negotiations between Tishman Speyer and the New York Fed's representative over the debt in the Chicago deal illuminate the often tangled relationships among moguls, lenders and government regulators. Jerry Speyer was a director of the New York Fed for seven years and chairman in 2007, when his term expired. His good friend Richard S. Fuld Jr., then chairman of <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span>, was also a director in 2007, and Lehman was Tishman Speyer's partner in the Archstone deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As chairman, Mr. Speyer met often with the president of the New York Fed, Timothy F. Geithner, who is now the Treasury secretary. After Mr. Speyer, who is 69, stepped down, the two men continued meeting in 2008 as <span class="companylink">Bear Stearns</span> and <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> collapsed, including at a lunch at the Four Seasons and a dinner at Gracie Mansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I had no conversations with him about Chicago or any Tishman-related deals,'' Mr. Speyer said of the meetings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Speyer is also well acquainted with two current directors, Lee C. Bollinger, the president of Columbia University, and Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, a research and lobbying group that represents some large banks and companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Speyer, chairman emeritus of Columbia, was instrumental in bringing Mr. Bollinger to New York from the University of Michigan, and Ms. Wylde is a protege from his days as chairman of the Partnership. Another director, James S. Tisch, the president of the <span class="companylink">Loews Corporation</span>, is, like Mr. Speyer, a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though he has ties to directors of the New York Fed, Mr. Speyer notes that his company is not dealing directly with it to renegotiate loans on the Chicago properties. Instead, Tishman Speyer is in talks with the Fed's representative, Blackstone -- and the two companies have been at the negotiating table before. Tishman Speyer bought the Chicago buildings from Blackstone. And a few months earlier, a partnership led by Tishman Speyer bought the 26 CarrAmerica buildings in Washington from Blackstone, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end, the Fed will decide how to settle with Tishman Speyer, but Jack Gutt, a New York Fed spokesman, said that the directors ''don't vote on this matter.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tishman Speyer itself put up $200 million from one of its investment funds for the Carr buildings. As in Chicago, the combination of a recession, layoffs and a credit freeze sharply drove down the value of the heavily leveraged buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August, Tishman Speyer suspended interest payments on $570 million in secondary loans related to the Carr buildings and began talks on restructuring $1.6 billion in senior debt; the negotiations continue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the Speyers and <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> decided to buy Archstone Smith, the publicly traded operator of multifamily housing, and to take it private, Tishman Speyer invested $250 million for 5 percent of the deal. The bulk of the debt and equity came from <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span>, <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> and <span class="companylink">Barclays</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem with the strategy was that rents as well as sale prices retreated quickly as the recession deepened, pushing down property values. And there were few buyers for the thousands of apartments the company tried to sell to cut its debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year ago, Tishman Speyer's partners poured $485 million more into Archstone to prop up the company. The Speyers decided not to participate, effectively writing off their investment. As a result, their stake in the deal was reduced significantly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In California, Tishman Speyer and its joint venture partner Walton Street Capital are trying to fend off lenders on the Playa Vista property in western Los Angeles. The partners are completing an office complex on one parcel but defaulted on a 56-acre portion of the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NONE of its troubled deals, however, have generated as many headlines as Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village, the sprawling housing complexes that have been a middle-class haven in Manhattan for six decades. The sale set off a hue and cry among tenant advocates who complained that speculators were gobbling up a chunk of the rent-regulated housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rent roll at Stuyvesant Town did not come anywhere close to covering the debt service. The Speyers and BlackRock were betting that income would swell as they renovated apartments, raised rents and replaced rent-regulated residents with tenants willing to pay higher, market rents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the conversion process did not move as quickly as they anticipated. And market rents have dropped over the last two years as new luxury apartments have come on line and the recession has set in. On Jan. 8, Tishman Speyer and its partner defaulted on a $3 billion mortgage after exhausting $890 million in reserve funds for interest and renovations. There is $1.4 billion more in secondary loans and $1.9 billion in equity, but the latest appraisal puts the value of the complexes at about $1.9 billion, about a third of the purchase price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another blow, the owners may owe tenants as much as $200 million in back rent after New York's highest court ruled last fall that the owners had improperly deregulated and raised rents on 4,400 apartments. The owners are now negotiating over the size of the rent rebate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tishman Speyer says it is in discussions with its senior lenders to restructure the debt. It will probably take many months to untangle the finances, but given the extent of the losses and the political interest in the two complexes, some bankers and real estate executives say it is hard to imagine how the Speyers could remain in control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five lenders that together hold about $300 million in senior mezzanine loans notified Tishman Speyer and BlackRock on Jan. 11 that they intended to pursue their ''rights and remedies,'' including a possible foreclosure sale. The lenders include Concord Capital and <span class="companylink">Wachovia</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the recent problems, the Speyers don't act downtrodden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've done a lot of deals,'' says Jerry Speyer. ''We've had some fantastic results. We've also had some bad results. I'd argue that there's nobody that does what we do that has a better record.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A ROCKLAND County hamlet in Orangetown, several miles southwest of Nyack, Pearl River is not nearly as trendy as its neighbors. It doesn't have Hudson River views or storied estates. Its downtown of unadorned storefronts is a plain Jane next to Nyack's or Piermont's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But residents like Cathy and Peter Clancy have found more than enough to satisfy them. One asset they cite is simple good looks: small- and medium-size Capes and colonials on well-kept lots. Another is the homespun values of many residents and merchants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has been 14 years since they paid in the low $200,000s for a four-bedroom two-bath ranch on a quarter acre. Today the Clancys -- he is a police sergeant in New York City and she is a saleswoman for a trade show company -- are rearing three children in Pearl River. It's a place without pretensions, Mrs. Clancy said -- ''a good place for a family.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another plus: Even as home prices in trendier neighboring towns rose sharply in the early 2000s and then plummeted in the market crash, the value of the Clancys' ranch inched slowly up to the $400,000s and held relatively steady.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Richard Ellis, the managing member of Ellis <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span> in Nyack, put it, ''Properties next to the Hudson had more demand and soared in price more quickly. And while communities like Pearl River did not, they also did not fall as much in value. It's been a safe, solid investment for a lot of buyers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not that the poor economy hasn't been felt in the hamlet. The four-block downtown shopping area, especially, is pockmarked with vacancies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These days we live in the shadow of malls,'' said Jack Neugarten, known as Ed, and the owner since 1978 of Ed's Market, an old-style butcher shop with sawdust on the floors. Mr. Neugarten prides himself on knowing most customers by name, and on the quality of his meat -- in particular the corned beef. It is especially sought after around St. Patrick's Day, as census numbers show about 47 percent of residents are of Irish descent, and the second-largest St. Patrick's Day parade in the state is held there (the largest being in Manhattan), according to Denis M. Troy, a former president of the Ancient Order of Hibernians, an Irish Catholic group with some 700 members in the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bemoaning the proximity of the Palisades Center in West Nyack, the Nanuet Mall in Nanuet, and large stores just to the south in New Jersey, which do not tax clothing, Mr. Neugarten declared, ''They do an injustice to small merchants like myself.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, said Mr. Troy, an Orangetown councilman who lives in Pearl River, getting any kind of competitive traction in the current economy isn't easy for a hamlet without its own government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As one of 10 hamlets and 4 villages in Orangetown (among them Piermont and part of Nyack), Pearl River must vie for government grants to improve sidewalks and lighting and otherwise make the downtown a more desirable shopping destination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And as for becoming a village -- with its own local government and presumably more clout -- that idea is not popular with most residents, said Daniel G. Smith, a landscaper and member of the local Rotary Club who grew up in Pearl River. ''If the town had its own administration,'' he said, ''it would just present another level of taxes, and most of us don't want that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT YOU'LL FIND</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pearl River has about 16,000 people; it is 17 miles north of Manhattan and just north of New Jersey. Slightly less than half of its seven-square-mile area is zoned residential. Of the rest, about half a square mile is set aside as open space and about a third of a square mile as parkland; the remainder is commercial, according to the assessor's office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the largest parks is the municipal Blue Hill Golf Course to the east, overlooking Lake Tappan, a reservoir that cuts through Orangetown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hamlet was laid out in the 1870s around Central Avenue downtown. Today, roads fanning out from the avenue are lined with tidy bungalows, ranches, Capes and colonials, on lots of one-eighth to three-fourths of an acre throughout the hilly terrain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One large commercial landholder is Glorious Sun Robert Martin, a Manhattan- and Hong Kong-based real estate company that owns the 1.1 million square foot Blue Hill Plaza, one of the largest office parks between New York City and Albany. The two Blue Hill buildings -- the taller one, at 21 stories, was one of the county's first skyscrapers in the early 1970s -- are on 93 heavily treed acres along Veteran's Memorial Drive in the southeast section. <span class="companylink">Pfizer</span>, another major commercial landowner, occupies a 550-acre site, most of it in the northern part of the hamlet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT YOU'LL PAY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices range from $329,000, for a two-bedroom one-and-a-half-bath ranch, to $1.135 million for a five-bedroom three-and-a-half-bath colonial. The median for a single-family house in 2009 was $418,000, down from $445,000 the year before and $443,300 in 2004, according to the Lower Hudson Valley Multiple Listing Service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Smith, 52, the Rotarian, says it was in 1951 that his father, Lawrence, now 89, bought the colonial that the two men now share with a third-generation family member, his son Sean, 22. The eldest Mr. Smith paid $13,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newcomers like Dan and Kate Inserra, who own Danny's BBQ Bar &amp;Grill in the downtown, are dealing with a vastly different market. But Pearl River still offers bargains, especially compared with many other sections of Rockland. For instance the listing service put the median for a single-family in Upper Nyack last year at $550,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. and Mrs. Inserra, who are renting a carriage house for $1,000 a month, are looking to spend about $400,000 on a three- or four-bedroom house. ''We have lots to choose from,'' Mr. Inserra said, explaining that they will wait to see if prices drop further, but will act in time to take advantage of the government's tax credit for first-time home buyers. Realtor.com now lists eight single-families from $400,000 to $450,000, including a four-bedroom two-bath ranch at $428,998, with taxes of $7,773 a year. Condominiums start at $165,000, for a studio; a two-bedroom one-and-a-half-bath is listed at $284,500. In total, there are about a dozen now listed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT TO DO</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A focus of the downtown entertainment scene is Jane on Main, a combination restaurant/gathering place/shop that its owner, Jane Carroll, opened in August. It has become a favorite destination for many groups, among them young mothers with toddlers during the day, and couples and young singles later on. Kenneth Olori, 23, a lifelong resident, who repairs construction equipment, often heads to one of the several bars in towns with friends, or to Pearl River Lanes for a night of bowling. Increasingly, though, he spends evenings at Jane on Main, which, as he put it, offers ''good food and good conversation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For families like the Clancys, with school-age children, the general area offers a variety of recreational pursuits. During Christmas vacation, Mrs. Clancy and her three children -- a girl, 12, and boys 10 and 7 -- skied at Mount Peter in nearby Warwick and skated on an outdoor ice rink at Bear Mountain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE SCHOOLS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Pearl River School District, which encompasses most of the hamlet of Pearl River as well as slivers of Orangeburg, West Nyack, Nanuet and Tappan, has an enrollment of about 2,700 in three elementary schools, a middle school and a high school.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of fourth-graders last year, 92 percent met state proficiency standards in English and 97 percent in math, versus 77 and 87 percent statewide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAT averages last spring were 531 in reading, 563 in math and 535 in writing, versus 480, 500 and 470 statewide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the 198 graduates in 2009, said Sandy Cokely, a district spokeswoman, 70 percent are attending four-year colleges, 23 percent are at two-year colleges and 1 percent at vocational schools. Another 2 percent entered the military, 1 percent joined the work force and the rest were undecided.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE COMMUTE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The train commute to the city on <span class="companylink">New Jersey Transit</span>'s Pascack Valley Line to Secaucus Junction and then Pennsylvania Station, or to Hoboken and then via PATH train, takes about 55 minutes. A monthly ticket costs $215. Some commuters drive about 25 minutes to the park-and-ride section of the Vince Lombardi Service Area of the New Jersey Turnpike and board a <span class="companylink">New Jersey Transit</span> bus into the Port Authority, which takes another 30 minutes or so, depending on traffic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE HISTORY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pearl River, originally called Muddy Brook, was renamed about 1870, after a resident said he had discovered pearls in mussels from the waterway, according to Robert P. Knight, an author of a book published in honor of the hamlet's centennial in 1973. Julius E. Braunsdorf bought and developed the land in the early 1870s, donating a strip of property running through it to the now-defunct New Jersey and New York Railroad.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MY face betrayed me, disbelief slowly turning to distress as I stared silently at the Sunday real estate listings spread out on the kitchen table. It was a look my wife had seen too many times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Brooklyn?'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I nodded, obediently and guiltily.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Why do that to yourself?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I shook my head and pretended I hadn't heard the question.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I can't believe what these apartments are going for.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I couldn't blame my wife, Beth Albert, for wanting to scream, ''Enough already!'' She has had to live with my real estate remorse for years, but I just couldn't stop myself from rubbernecking when passing by the wreckage of our long-ago investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has been 16 1/2 years since we sold a two-bedroom apartment in Brooklyn Heights, en route to the suburbs and the birth of a second child. Actually, I should say that we gave it away: We lost about $80,000 on a $240,000 purchase made in 1988.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We were far from alone in our selling frenzy during the housing downturn of the early 1990s. In our four-unit brick town house, everyone wanted out of a bad marriage to the dowdy adjoining building with 10 smaller apartments, officially part of our co-op. We were all fed up with internecine issues that created financial stress and tension among neighbors and friends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With credit tight and our co-op financials barking like rabid dogs, Beth and I were ecstatic when our banker told us he would allow a qualified buyer to assume our mortgage. Fantasizing, we put our place on the market for what we had paid for it, $240,000. Weeks later, a nice young doctor and his wife came along to pick up the roughly $140,000 we owed and to cover our closing and moving expenses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In return, they received 1,000-plus square feet in a third-floor walk-up that featured a loftlike living room with a custom-built full wall unit (our addition), a modern bath and kitchen, and a closet containing a stacked washer-dryer. With a health club and a train station around the corner, it was bright, convenient living, gloriously enhanced by rear-building parking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We moved away in early summer 1993, and I had no reason to look back, not until 2 1/2 years later when the doctor's wife called. She needed me -- the co-op board president at the time of our departure -- to sign over a document to my successor to execute the sale of her apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When I asked how she had made out, she said, ''You really want to know?'' Her pitying tone told me everything. The market had taken off and she and the good doctor had made a quick killing. I soon had a new hobby, punishing myself with an occasional browsing of the Brooklyn listings, the fine print shouting, ''What were you thinking?'' I've indulged in this torture ever since.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I will admit that dwelling on the past is nonproductive and so not cool. I've wanted to stop, but how?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Write about it, a friend suggested. My exasperated wife supported the idea of self-intervention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So I sent an e-mail message to a former fellow shareholder, Simon Brady, explaining that I was planning to revisit my real estate decision of 1993. ''Wow, that would be painful,'' he shot back. And he would know, having lost even more on his apartment than I did on mine. But he agreed: ''It could be cathartic.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I called the man who had lived with his wife and young children on the floor below us. Those Brooklyn days, he said, were a bad dream that he did not wish to publicly return to for personal reasons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for the record, he said he had paid $255,000 for his apartment and had sold it two months after we sold ours. He received $155,000, and paid $25,000 to the bank at closing, to make up a shortfall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We needed to find a place quickly after moving to New York and starting work, and that is how you lose $100,000 in a real estate deal,'' my old neighbor said. ''You're desperate to get in and desperate to get out. But I've never gone back to see what prices there were. I just put that part of my life behind me.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, I am perfectly capable of chalking up a used car as a lemon. But I was going to have to dig deeper into myself to get over blowing what might have been a college education fund for two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next up for a years-overdue reunion were Mr. Brady and his wife, Rachel Look, who live in Rockville Centre, N.Y., with their two children. Perched on the floor above us, Rachel and Simon were known in our apartment as R and S because our toddler son, Alex, habitually presented them with the correct alphabet blocks when they stopped by after work to play on the carpet. Witnesses to budding genius, they were like extended family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Brady, an equity derivatives broker, was transferred to London in 1992, shortly after the birth of their daughter. His request to sublet precipitated a stomach-churning dispute that put me between the interests of my friends and the shareholders, who feared that allowing more apartments to become owner unoccupied would make it even more difficult to sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Brady was turned down. His apartment remained empty, depriving us of upstairs neighbors and him of about $2,500 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I do remember lying in bed in London at night, thinking that I'd just paid my rent here and my mortgage and maintenance in Brooklyn and I'm getting hammered,'' he said over dinner in the old neighborhood. ''Now I wonder: Why didn't I put up more of a fight?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In early 1994, Mr. Brady got a call from his broker. There was an offer, finally. ''Here I had a two-bedroom in Brooklyn Heights, with parking, sold it for $155,000, lost almost $100,000 and thought, 'Thank God,' '' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Look laughed. Mr. Brady looked at her quizzically.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What else can you do?'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Brady said, ''Cry?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike her husband, and more like my wife, Ms. Look said she never lost sleep over the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The way I've always looked at it,'' she said, ''is that because the market was so bad, we could all move into houses that we couldn't have afforded if the market had been good.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This was a fair point and an excellent rationalization. But as none of us had taken a dime out of our apartments, we hadn't had to sell them to move. In hindsight, allowing open-ended subletting until the market improved would have been the prudent strategy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next I went to see our old first-floor neighbors, Aaron Marcu and Mary Lu Bilek, who still live in Brooklyn Heights. There, Ms. Bilek posed the crucial question: ''Were any of us at the time really prepared to be shareholders and landlords for one day longer than necessary?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Marcu and Ms. Bilek had the largest apartment of the four, a duplex with two bathrooms and 500 square feet in the basement. They had bought it in 1985, the year the buildings became a co-op. Mr. Marcu, a lawyer, and Ms. Bilek, an associate dean at the School of Law of the City University of New York, were the first to discover the headaches that came with our sister building next door.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''None of us could have known how much of an albatross the other building was going to be,'' Mr. Marcu said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having inherited several rent-controlled apartments there, the sponsors fell thousands of dollars behind on their maintenance payments. As treasurer, Ms. Bilek had to badger them monthly. Routine maintenance required hasty assessments. City tax bills went unpaid. Foreclosure was possible. This was the news my wife and I were greeted with at our first board meeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eventually, with the help of a building manager, the sponsors were forced to transfer their shares to an investor who was willing to cover their debt. Presented with the keys to his new kingdom, our savior proceeded to sneak into the other building, which housed our utilities, to turn off the heat on frigid winter nights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His goal was to freeze out the renters, but he conveniently forgot about the welfare of the shareholders and their young children. As president, I reluctantly assumed the role of middle-of-the-night super.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Marcu and Ms. Bilek, who now have twin college-age sons, sold their apartment in 1994 for what they had paid nine years earlier, around $200,000, but only after several deals had fallen through, including one for $380,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Marcu said he had no regrets. Testing his fortitude, I reported that his old apartment had recently been advertised on Trulia.com for $1.395 million. He winced slightly, but recovered quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We didn't make a good business decision,'' he said. ''But I'd like to think we made a good life decision. As long as we were there, the situation with the other building wasn't going to change.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I wondered about that on my way to a meeting with John Grathwol, who bought the Brady-Look apartment 15 years ago and is the co-op's current president. Back at the building for the first time since 1993, I rang the buzzer. There was no sound. My God, I wondered, could this be the same intercom that always shorted out in winter because it had been inexpertly installed? I felt a little better already.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Grathwol, who works for the New York City Office of Budget and Management, invited Sven Grell, a banker and the owner of my old apartment, to join us. I regaled them with stories about the co-op's tumultuous history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Grathwol brought me up to date, explaining that six of the 10 units next door were now owned by the estate of the second investor. Only two apartments remain rent-controlled. The two-building partnership was still a time-consuming challenge, he said, but the co-op had stabilized financially during the real estate boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I asked what they believed their apartments were worth and braced myself. If recent appraisals for refinancing were accurate, almost $900,000, Mr. Grathwol said. He smiled like a man whose purchase price -- on paper, anyway -- had more than quadrupled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alright, I admit it, it was a blow, but not as much of one as it might have been before I began my therapy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Two bedrooms in this neighborhood with parking, it's always going to be gold,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why hadn't that been obvious to us?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Climbing to Mr. Grathwol's apartment, I had had a flashback. How had I forgotten that early in my wife's second pregnancy with our son Charly, she had been bedridden? That I had fretted constantly about her walking up the stairs? Clearly, we all had our distractions back then, and we were exhausted after years of living through the co-op wars. But with emerging careers, we at least had options, the ability to go elsewhere and start over as home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And after reconnecting with our old neighbors, the other thought I am left with -- and hope to hang onto -- is that as much money as we lost, judging a period of life by the bottom line is the road to existential ruin. We took away good memories from Brooklyn, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Mr. Grell graciously offered us the chance to revisit our old apartment, Beth and I couldn't help but share nostalgic glances. Even if Alex had no recollection of ever having been there, this was where we had started our family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I suppose, then, that the closure I have been looking for might be in the realization that the apartment was never just an investment. It was a place to live.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of an editing error, the ''In the Region'' article in Westchester and Connecticut copies last Sunday, about the state of the housing market in Connecticut, referred incorrectly to 14 sales in New Canaan in 2008. That was the number for the fourth quarter, not ''all of 2008.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Sun Jan 24 2010</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">COMING off one of the worst years ever for the housing market, Connecticut has reason to be hopeful that 2010 will be better -- chiefly because it is hard to imagine the economy sliding precipitously enough for sales to fall still further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of the end of November (the latest month for which data was available), 22,200 single-family homes had sold statewide in 2009, a decline of 4 percent from the same period in 2008. By comparison, in 2006, the number of transactions exceeded 32,000. The median price slid by 11 percent statewide -- more like 15 to 20 percent in hard-hit Fairfield County.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders all but stopped building in 2009. The number of permits issued had not broken 3,000 as of the end of November, a ''pretty terrible'' tally compared with the more ''normal'' level of 11,000 to 12,000 permits a year, said Peter M. Gioia, the economist for the Connecticut Business and Industry Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, there are signs that the correction is nearly complete. The market picked up markedly toward the end of the year, with sales volume up an impressive 75 percent in November, according to the Warren Group, a real estate data provider in Boston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gioia said he was confident that the state's housing market was, in fact, in recovery, with Fairfield County being a possible exception. He cautioned, however, that upward progress would be slow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're in a modest uptick,'' he explained, ''but we're at the very beginning of it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Connecticut doesn't have an overbuilt market to contend with, like Florida or Nevada, for example. However, market stability has been undermined by job loss, extended unemployment and persistent foreclosure activity. And far from adding jobs this year, Connecticut employers are likely to lay off another 15,000 workers, Mr. Gioia said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unemployment, estimated by the state at 8 to 9 percent, is abetting the rise in foreclosure filings. In the state's court-based foreclosure mediation program, which was made mandatory last year for all eligible foreclosure actions, the number of cases in mediation in the last quarter of 2009 rose 19 percent over the previous year, to 6,742.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the 4,448 cases mediated between mid-2008, when the program began, and Oct. 31, 2009, 61 percent have resulted in a modification of loan terms that allows owners to stay in their homes, said Roberta Palmer, the program manager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The long-term success of those modifications, however, is unknown. The court has not figured out a way to track what percentage wind up back in default, Ms. Palmer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until now the state's poorest cities have borne the brunt of the foreclosure crisis. But filings of notices of pending foreclosure lawsuits -- called lis pendens -- are showing up more frequently in town clerks' offices in affluent suburbs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the total numbers are still small relative to cities like Bridgeport and New Haven, lis pendens, the first step in Connecticut's foreclosure process, were up 75 to 115 percent last year in the Fairfield County towns of Greenwich, New Canaan, Westport and Wilton, according to the Warren Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with the federal first-time home-buyer tax credit and low interest rates, growing seller anxiety could be contributing to increased sales activity. Tim Sickinger, a partner in Ladd Financial, a mortgage company in Westport, said that although purchases had definitely picked up over the last few months, he had also noticed that ''the sellers tend to be more distressed,'' especially in the higher price ranges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Greenwich last year, sales were so slow that the 10 sales in the first 8 days of this month encouraged Russell Pruner, an owner of Shore &amp;Country Properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pruner said he thought that 2009 would ''end up the worst year in the history of Greenwich real estate.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home values in town have dropped 25 to 33 percent over the past two years, and houses priced accordingly are drawing buyer interest, Mr. Pruner said. Like Mr. Gioia, Mr. Pruner isn't ready to declare that the Greenwich-area market has hit bottom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he thinks the market may have fallen far enough to entice the renters waiting in the wings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We truly have pent-up demand,'' he said. ''We've got 100-plus people in rentals paying $10,000, $15,000 a month. That was a smart move in 2009, but will they pony up again for 2010? I don't think they will.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales in New Canaan also picked up at the end of the year, with 35 fourth-quarter sales, as opposed to 14 in all of 2008, according to Denise Gannalo, an agent with William Raveis. Among those sales was a bank-owned property she originally listed for $3.9 million. The six-bedroom property finally sold for $1.9 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While encouraged by rising sales, Ms. Gannalo sees trouble ahead for some who bought in 2005, the height of the market. This year alone, the average selling price in New Canaan fell by 21 percent, which may mean that some highly leveraged homeowners now owe more than their house is worth, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as home values have declined, land prices have remained high in Fairfield County, as well as in other parts of the state. That is making it doubly difficult for builders to re-enter the market, said George LaCava, the president of Trilacon Development Corporation in Cromwell, and the president of the Homebuilders Association of Connecticut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Land seems to be one investment that people are holding onto as a hedge, betting that it will hold its value, he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHEN Habitat for Humanity New York City consulted an architecture firm on its new site in the Ocean Hill section of Brownsville, Brooklyn, it received a response that switched on a light bulb. The firm, Dattner Architects, said that Habitat could proceed with its plan to build 12 town houses on the trash-strewn vacant lot, but that the site was actually capable of supporting many more units in apartment form -- 41, to be exact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result, nearly three years and one entirely new development model later, is the largest creation in Habitat's history, an $11.6 million three-building complex on Atlantic Avenue, complete with LEED Gold certification. About 10,000 requests were received for the 41 slots; the applicants eventually selected were required to make down payments of 1 percent on the building's condominiums, which ranged in price from $75,000 to $200,000. They were also required to invest 300 hours of work, which Habitat, a nonprofit organization, calls ''sweat equity,'' in the development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the past, they were building single-family dwellings, not a 41-unit complex as they did here on Atlantic Avenue,'' said Rosalyn Jolly, a hospital clerical associate who recently moved from a cramped one-bedroom in Bushwick into a two-bedroom in the complex with her 15-year-old daughter. ''It's a wonderful thing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, perhaps with the notion that it is onto something, Habitat has begun altering its model in New York City. The volunteers so often photographed putting up the walls of a standalone house, sometimes with a smiling Jimmy Carter in tow, are now helping erect larger buildings (alongside future residents). And the city's branch of Habitat just learned last week that it will receive about $10.5 million in funding from the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, part of a $2 billion outlay to help nonprofits and governments expand their services for affordable housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the South Bronx, a 50-unit co-op building on Fox Street is mostly finished, and in February, Habitat will begin taking applications for a development a few blocks away. The 63-unit building on Prospect Avenue at Macy Place, for which final city approval was recently granted, is rising above the neighborhood, visible from the elevated train platform of the 2 and 5 subway lines down the street. Volunteers are to start work there in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''New York is a very dense city,'' said Ingrid Gould Ellen, a professor of public policy and urban planning at New York University's Wagner Graduate School of Public Service. ''So I think that building to the density levels that fit into the neighborhood landscape makes a lot of sense.'' The affordable-homeownership market, she said wryly, ''is not a market that is glutted right now.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet Habitat is taking on this new role of low-income condominium developer at a difficult time for such housing in New York. In fiscal year 2009, a 16-unit Habitat development in Bedford-Stuyvesant was the only below-market-rate homeownership deal to close with the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development. (In 2008, the total number was 24; in 2007, 27.) While Habitat works in ownership situations, the rental market is also struggling; the number of affordable units available per 100 extremely low-income households in New York State fell to 36 from 38 in 2008, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This situation exists despite Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's $7.5 billion affordable-housing initiative, created in 2003, which seeks to ''create or preserve'' 165,000 units. With 97,000 units financed thus far, according to the housing agency, the plan is on track to meet its goals by 2014, but demand remains high; the city's vacancy rate is 2.9 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this environment, Habitat has tripled its number of units under construction in the past six months -- thanks in part, it says, to its sweat-equity ownership model.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Ideally, in our quest to serve as many families in need as possible, what we want to do is to be as nimble and as entrepreneurial as possible,'' said Josh Lockwood, Habitat's executive director in New York City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Applicants, 90 percent of whom are typically rejected quickly, must submit to a home visit and interviews as well as maintain a 620 credit score. Under a loan agreement between Habitat and the State of New York Mortgage Agency, buyers putting in 300 hours of work on their buildings receive a 2 percent interest rate, which Habitat buys down to zero percent. In addition to the 1 percent they put down, buyers make monthly payments equal to a third of their incomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We don't give anything away,'' Mr. Lockwood said. ''These families have to build their own homes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cost of building for Habitat is reduced further by fund-raising and the large pool of volunteers. Of course, given market conditions and land availability in the city, not every new endeavor can be as ambitious as the Ocean Hill complex.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Bronx, Habitat's two new buildings are partnerships with the Blue Sea Development Company, which has worked with the city on affordable housing in the past. That means about three-quarters of the units will not be sold under the Habitat sweat-equity terms described above -- although they will still be sold below market rate, and are therefore considered affordable housing. Indeed, the word ''Habitat'' isn't in evidence on the banners on those buildings (the words ''Affordable Housing'' are); Habitat says it is marketing its share of the units through its normal means.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The hope is that we can use both models,'' Mr. Lockwood said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Either way, new residents are happy. Taking a group of visitors through her family's earth-toned two-bedroom at Atlantic Avenue, Mirian Rodriguez spoke with pride, and some surprise, about the construction skills she had learned over the last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I knew what Sheetrock was, but I didn't know how to put it in,'' she said. ''You had to be on your knees.'' She works part time at Jamaica Hospital; her husband, Miguel Baez, works as a porter in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their place is filled with new appliances, a gift from her parents (''It was on sale,'' she says), along with a big-boy bed for her son, Adrian, and all the Hot Wheels paraphernalia that can fit in one child's room. It's a far cry from the tiny one-bedroom they rented in Cypress Hills, Brooklyn, with crime and commotion in the hallways. The new place is quiet and comfortable, and it smells good.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're very thankful,'' she said. ''It's ours.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wayne D. Puff, who ran a huge Ponzi scheme fueled by the free-flowing money of the subprime mortgage era, was sentenced on Thursday to 18 years in federal prison and ordered to pay more than $100 million in restitution to his victims.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the sentencing in United States District Court in Newark, Judge Jose L. Linares called Mr. Puff the architect of one of the biggest real estate frauds in New Jersey history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From 1998 until the Securities and Exchange Commission caught up with Mr. Puff in 2005, some 1,200 investors from across the country poured $123.3 million into his company, New Jersey Affordable Homes. Mr. Puff drew investors by advertising guaranteed annual returns of 15 to 20 percent from his business of buying, renovating and reselling real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From offices in Woodbridge and Perth Amboy, N.J., he worked with a mortgage broker who fudged applications and appraisers who pumped up real estate values. Properties were flipped among investors at artificially high prices, often without their knowledge. The scheme cost investors $55 million, saddled banks with $25 million in bad loans and plunged 400 New Jersey properties into legal limbo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Puff was arrested in June 2008, months before the collapse of <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> revealed the damage caused by the same loose mortgage standards that enabled Mr. Puff to keep getting loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This fraud is a perfect confluence of traditional Ponzi as well as mortgage fraud of staggering proportions,'' said Robert Kirsch, a federal prosecutor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ten of his co-conspirators -- including a lawyer, an appraiser and a mortgage loan processor -- have pleaded guilty. Mr. Puff pleaded guilty in April 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kirsch, who prosecuted the case with a fellow assistant United States attorney, Justin W. Arnold, said scores of Mr. Puff's investors, including many senior citizens, sent statements to the court describing how their life savings had been lost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Puff appeared in court unshaven and in prison clothes and vowed to devote himself to repaying his victims, Mr. Kirsch said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an article in The New York Times about Mr. Puff published in October 2008, two friends of his said they were surprised that Mr. Puff, who had worked as a home-repair contractor and run a small limousine company, had built such a large enterprise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One aggrieved investor said Mr. Puff had a gift of banter and often boasted of his prowess as a swing dancer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We used to call him Twinkle Toes,'' said the investor, Daniel Kelleher, of Lake Wales, Fla.</p>

</div><div class="author">By GERRY SHIH </div><div>1621 words</div><div>15 January 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>National Edition</div><div>19A</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the summer of 2008, a 13-year-old boy from San Francisco emerged from a government van and scanned his new surroundings. Five handsome houses, a small school and an old gymnasium stood on 11 rural acres in the Central Valley that bordered an almond orchard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond the last house was a soothing panorama of unbounded farmland, interrupted only by old Highway 99 and the big rigs that rumbled across the horizon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For more than two decades, this has been the setting that greeted more than 2,400 wards of the state as they arrive at the Excell Center ranch, a group home for foster boys with histories of violence or mental disabilities. It is situated just outside Turlock, 40 miles southeast of Stockton.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That the Excell Center, which now houses 52 youths from ages 10 to 18, has survived the die-off of foster homes is partly a matter of real-estate economics: it costs less to house people in the heart of the Central Valley than it does in urban areas, and it costs less to pay workers to take care of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other underlying economic reality, recently confirmed by a panel of federal judges, is that for 18 years, the state's reimbursement for foster care has fallen woefully short of its minimum goals. The combination of the two means foster care in the Bay Area has been hit harder than anywhere else in the state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a tale all too familiar in cash-strapped California, the foster care system has been coming apart from inadequate state financing for at least 20 years, officials at the county level say. In the past two months, a succession of key court decisions in favor of care providers lifted hopes that the judicial rulings might finally turn things around, but the lawsuits have simultaneously shed light on a system that has been cut to the bone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jill Duerr Berrick, a professor in the School of Social Welfare at the University of California, Berkeley, said that sooner or later the children would suffer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The supply and demand problem is so pressing,'' Professor Berrick said, ''that a child services agency is not always capable of finding the type of care that a child needs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The decline is going to continue for a while, but at some point state and county officials are going to have ask whether these shifts in care-giving settings are in the child's best interests.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the teenagers in need still have places to go, these places are farther from their homes and offer fewer services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From West Oakland to East Los Angeles to townships in the shadow of the Sierras, the neglected or abused boys are taken hundreds of miles to the Excell Center. Statewide, there are now 1,402 homes, down from 1,759 five years ago. During the trial of the federal lawsuit filed on behalf of group homes last year, the state said it paid the facilities 76 percent of their costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For foster parents, the math is even more skewed. Regina Deihl, a Half Moon Bay foster parent who filed a similar lawsuit against the state on behalf of individual foster parents, said that with compensation for foster parents covering only 68 percent of the actual cost, there had been nearly a 50 percent drop in the number of licensed foster parents in Santa Clara and San Mateo counties since 1991.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Kids are being outsourced to the Central Valley,'' Ms. Deihl said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Southern California more than 90 percent of foster care placements were in the child's home county, according to data compiled for the state by the University of California, Berkeley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is different in the north. In San Mateo County, the figure was 23.8 percent; in San Francisco it was 36 percent -- not quite 50 of the city's 130 placements. The figures for Contra Costa and Santa Clara Counties were 59.2 percent and 69.7 percent, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many officials and experts say the group home's demise is a sign that the state is shifting toward a healthier child-welfare philosophy that favors placement with relatives, whenever possible. State data show that 4,116 children are in group homes, down from a high of more than 6,900 in 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others, however, worry that the swift disappearance of local providers results in faraway or inappropriate placements that hamper efforts to rehabilitate children with their families. These cases also add to the strains on California's social workers, who already juggle caseloads twice the recommended limit, said Frank J. Mecca, director of the County Welfare Directors Association of California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local social-service officials disagree that distant placement is always a problem. Trent Rhorer, San Francisco's head of human services, said his county had no difficulty finding nearby placements for children. Asked about the 64 percent of youths placed out of the city, Mr. Rhorer suggested that the numbers failed to account for San Francisco's small size.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You have to remember this is a county of seven by seven miles,'' he said, ''so Daly City or Oakland, just across the bridge, are considered 'out-of-county.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across that bridge, Tara Beckman, the deputy director of Alameda County's Court Appointed Special Advocates Program, does not have enough space for wards from her own county. Ms. Beckman said the youths who needed more special services were being placed in homes in other parts of the state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There just aren't the placements in Alameda to put them,'' she said. Alameda's in-county placement rate is 45.6 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kathy Marsh, a placement supervisor for Contra Costa County, said she had sent children to Redding, Nevada City and Victorville. Those placements severely test her department, as case workers, who are supposed to visit their assigned children once a month, often cut their visits short because they are so busy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To help one other, some who are visiting distant facilities drop in on children assigned to a co-worker, to save the other person a trip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The mileage they put on is just ridiculous,'' Ms. Marsh said. But with several homes closing in the county every year, she added, it has not been a matter of choice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We just don't have programs in-county to meet those needs anymore,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lack of money affects not just where the children live, but also how much money is spent on clothes and food, and how well workers in those group homes are compensated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the California Alliance of Child and Family Services, which filed the suit on behalf of group homes, the California Necessities Index, a measure of price inflation for goods like food and clothes, has risen by 76 percent since 1990, the last time federal compensation guidelines were drawn. The state has raised its payments by 33 percent in the past 20 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rates set in 1990 also assumed an hourly wage of $5.93 for entry-level child-care workers, 40 percent above the minimum wage of $4.25. The equivalent wage that is supported by state payments today is 22 cents above the state minimum wage of $8 an hour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In November, a federal judge blocked the state's plan to save $19 million by further cutting payments to group homes by 10 percent, which would have supported an entry-level wage below the state minimum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I know the state is in serious straits,'' said Judge Marilyn H. Patel of Federal District Court, who expressed concern of ''injury beyond repair'' to children in group homes. ''We're talking about children one step away from the criminal justice system.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled in December that the California Department of Social Services was in violation of a federal law because it failed to fully compensate group homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite its location 110 miles from San Francisco, the Excell Center near Turlock has roots in the Bay Area. Its parent organization, Aspiranet, operated 10 homes with 64 beds in San Mateo County in the 1980s. But it struggled to stay afloat, so Vernon M. Brown, Aspiranet's director, moved much of the operation to the Central Valley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company thrived. It now employs more than 700 people statewide. Fifty-two boys are at the campus near Turlock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You're paying someone $14 an hour in there and $9 an hour out here,'' said Christopher Essary, who runs the Turlock program. ''That's the difference.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Mr. Essary spoke last month in the living room of one of the tidy homes, the boy from San Francisco, now a slight 15-year-old, ate corn dogs in the kitchen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eighteen months ago, when social workers picked the boy up, he left behind a life of clashes in his grandmother's Inner Richmond home, but also carefree moments spent with friends at the Westfield Mall or the Shiekh Shoes store downtown. The day he arrived at his new home, he said, his first thought was ''AWOL-ing'' -- running away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has not acted on the impulse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I got used to it,'' the boy said with a shrug. ''We had some fun trips, like to Disneyland.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His grandmother has never visited.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE Big Island's Kona-Kohala Coast in Hawaii, a stretch of about 35 miles of northwest shoreline, isn't free of resorts and private communities, but there are far fewer than one might expect. In part this is the result of pressure at both local and state levels to stop the overbuilding that characterized development in places like Honolulu and the island of Maui. The developments here promote their open spaces and low-density building plans as thoughtful efforts to respect the land, noting that these efforts add value to their real estate by limiting inventory and offering breathtaking views.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four districts make up the Kona-Kohala Coast, which is home to the town of Kailua-Kona and a varied landscape that offers geographical drama in the form of ancient fish ponds, lava fields, shelter caves and Pacific Ocean views with mountainous volcanic backdrops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers tend to be second-home owners, not investors; occupancy for rentals is low. Owners fly in to enjoy a climate that offers an average rainfall of only eight inches a year, and to snorkel, swim, windsurf, hike, whale watch and golf before returning, for the most part, to the Western and Southwestern United States. Other residents include owners from Canada and Japan who bought in the 1980s or 1990s, when their currencies were stronger than the United States dollar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are also people from the Northeast who, because of improved flight connections, are buying there in increasing numbers. Many of the property owners in these private and resort communities are serial buyers, purchasing a lower-priced property to begin, then selling and buying a more expensive home in the same community a few years later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both the resorts and private communities along the Kona-Kohala Coast experienced a relatively steady buildup in sales and prices until 2008 and 2009, when prices dropped by about 30 percent. Property prices are still significantly lower than they have been in years. They range from the mid-$400,000s for a two-bedroom condominium of 1,100-square feet, not including a lanai, to nearly $30-million for a single-family house on a golf green with ocean frontage. In all cases home prices are driven by the amenities of the development, and by the orientation, square footage, lot size and custom construction of the home itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HIGH</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This 5,160-square-foot house is on a terraced lot with natural anchialine ponds and views of white sand beaches, Hualalai mountain and the fifth fairway of the Ke'olu Golf Course. In addition to a 1,277-square-foot lanai, there is an infinity pool and spa, sunken outdoor bar and barbecue.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IT'S the lore and lure of bucolic small-town living: The community is so safe, people don't even lock their doors. But Joyce Weisshappel, a 63-year-old vice president with <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, a real estate company, does not live in a small town; she lives in Manhattan, in a luxury apartment building. And she doesn't think she has ever locked her door in the 30 years she has lived there -- she doesn't even know where the keys are.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why would she lock the door, she asks. There are 24-hour doormen, delivery people cannot enter the building unescorted and she's never heard of a crime being committed there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Matt, a 32-year-old marketing manager -- who, like many people interviewed for this article, declined to use his last name because of concerns about security -- does not lock his door, either. And the house he rents with two other men in San Diego seems far less secure: there have been at least three burglaries in the homes flanking his since September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Matt has never had a key to his house. When he moved to San Diego from Honolulu on a whim five years ago, the landlord, who is charging him very low rent, told him that if he wanted a key, he would have to have one made, he says. He has never bothered and neither have any of his roommates. And there are valuable items in the house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have three big-screen TVs in our living room, which faces out on a busy main street,'' Matt says. ''I don't know if we're asking for it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Isn't he concerned about theft?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They aren't my TVs,'' he says. ''Personally, I'm a minimalist. I basically own a laptop and a bed. It's no loss of mine if somebody were to ransack the house. I don't feel locking the door would make a difference. They could get in through the windows.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why doesn't he worry?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I grew up in Honolulu with my grandparents,'' he says. ''They had a huge house with a security system. They got robbed three or four times. Burglars would just find a way to get in. My mind-set is if somebody wants to get in, they're going to get in whether I have alarms or not.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The No Lock People: You may doubt their existence, particularly in big cities like New York, but people who do not lock the doors to their houses and apartments do exist -- and in surprising numbers. A 2008 survey by <span class="companylink">State Farm Insurance</span> of 1,000 homes across the country reported that fewer than half of those surveyed always locked their front doors. And while people who habitually lock their doors are incredulous that others do not, those who don't lock are surprised that anyone would be shocked by it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, just as there are cat people and dog people, Mac people and PC people, there seem to be Lock People and No Lock People. And when a committed Lock Person lives in the same building as a No Lock Person, things can heat up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's the height of naivete,'' says a New York businesswoman who identifies herself as a Double Lock Person. (She would not use her name, she says, for fear of incurring the anger of her neighbors.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I live in a high rise with a doorman, I've been there 15 years and I've never heard of a burglary in the building, but that has absolutely nothing to do with it -- it's common sense,'' she says. ''There is someone in my building who never locks her door. Her story is she would only lose the key. She has told the building staff to just go in.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The condo board sent this resident a letter, Ms. Double Lock says, notifying her, ''If you are stupid enough to keep the door open and yell to anyone within hearing distance that the door is open, and anyone who hears it can go on in, the building isn't going to be responsible for it'' if anything happened to her belongings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Double Lock Person understands that people who leave the house briefly to do nearby errands such as walking the dog may find it easier not to lock up -- but she still considers it reckless. Her son, who has a house in California, leaves the back door open because his children drift in and out, even though he's been robbed twice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''And they're in a beautiful neighborhood,'' she adds. ''What can you do?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her son is not alone in providing thieves with easy access. According to the F.B.I.'s most recent annual Uniform Crime Report, of the estimated 2,222,196 burglaries committed nationwide in 2008, 32.2 percent were unlawful entries without force. And a spokesman for the New York City Police Department reported that of the 19,263 burglaries that took place in New York City in 2009, 5,041 did not involve forced entry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These figures include commercial as well as residential properties, and burglaries without forced entry cannot be flatly equated with those that involve unlocked doors, because they may involve open windows; unauthorized use of a key; or theft by workers, family members or business associates. But unlocked doors are certainly a factor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inspector James Murtagh is the commanding officer of the 19th Precinct on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, which includes Park Avenue doorman buildings, brownstones and apartment houses. In his precinct, he estimates that 25 percent of burglaries are a result of an open door or window.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While out-of-towners may cling to the notion of New York as a city of triple locks and metal bars bracing the door -- an image common in movies from the 1960s and 1970s -- that idea is dramatically out of date. According to the Police Department, there were 210,703 burglaries in the city in 1980, more than 10 times as many as there were last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in some ways, Inspector Murtagh says, the city may be a victim of its own success -- people may have become too comfortable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My crime prevention officer goes to visit each one of the burglary locations,'' he says. ''And the resident will often tell the officer, 'I don't lock the door,' or they feel safe or it's a safe neighborhood. They blatantly admit it to us. The logic to them is they feel comfortable enough to leave it open.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BUT the decision to lock or not lock is not always logical -- often, it is based entirely on emotion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A person's perception of safety is not necessarily tied to statistics,'' says Lois Braverman, the president of the Ackerman Institute for the Family in New York, which trains mental health workers. ''A person's idea of safety is tied to variables that are very illogical but are part of the story they tell themselves.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Braverman -- who, it should be noted, lives in a Manhattan doorman building where she always locks her door, but spent much of her adult life in a house in Des Moines where she usually left her door unlocked during the day -- also insists that one should not equate locking habits with personality. She knows of no data that suggest No Lock People are risk-takers, she says, and it would be incorrect to assume that those who triple-lock their homes are cautious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I know of people who lock their doors, but will ski down the hardest, steepest runs in Colorado in their 60s,'' she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked about her own habit of locking her Des Moines house at night, but not during the day, Ms. Braverman explains that she had counseled many women attacked by intruders who came in through unlocked doors or windows at night. She only locked the house during the day when the family was away for an extended time, on vacation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wouldn't a burglar be just as likely to stroll in when the family was away for a shorter time?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''None of this is logical,'' Ms. Braverman admits. ''Everybody has their own internalized idea of what it makes sense to do.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Braverman grew up in a neighborhood of G.I. row houses in Philadelphia, she says, where her father ''would bolt-lock the house when we were all in together. I would say to him, 'Daddy, why are you doing that?' He would say, 'To take care of you.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How did that make the therapist feel?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I thought it was crazy,'' Ms. Braverman says. ''I thought it was such a pleasure to move someplace and feel safe. In Philadelphia, there were lots of cautionary tales. But my parents were first-generation Americans, and my grandparents all spoke Yiddish and lived with us, and they didn't feel very safe. They were all just trying to create safety.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Locking or not locking, it would seem, has more to do with one's internal geography than with the externals -- or, as Ms. Braverman puts it, the stories one tells oneself:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I am a free and easy person who is more concerned that my house is open to any friend who wants to drop by than with possessions. I live in a fine building in which people know and respect one another and there is no need to lock my door. I live in a building in which we are all good friends, and if someone who has a few too many drinks walks in by mistake one night and falls asleep on the couch, it's a good story that proves what a friendly place this is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clay, a 25-year-old college student in Sarasota, Fla., lives in the same three-bedroom house he grew up in. His family never locked the door, and he and his two roommates still don't. He has often come home to find uninvited friends watching ''Monday Night Football'' (cool); once he came home to find a friend and his girlfriend using his bed (not cool). ''That's my bed and those are my sheets, '' he said, tossing them out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that incident was not enough to persuade him to lock the door. He likes his friends to drop by.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephen is a well-traveled New Yorker who works in international public relations and is married with young children. He has spent most of his life in high-security doorman buildings on Park Avenue, and he never locks his door during the day -- the only key he carries is the one to his bicycle lock. He enjoys the luxury of not having to bother with a key; it's one of the reasons he pays that ''obscene'' $1,700-a-month maintenance fee, he says. He does not consider leaving his apartment door unlocked reckless or irresponsible; his doormen are vigilant and there has not been a robbery in his building in the 10 years he has lived there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sarah, a 52-year-old real estate broker who moved to New York 30 years ago, does not have a doorman. She lives on the top floor of what she calls a ''cozy'' 10-unit brownstone in Brooklyn, where she knows her neighbors and the two entrance doors are always locked. If she goes away for the day, she says, she locks her apartment door, but if it's just an hour or two, walking the dog, she doesn't bother.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's one less thing to do, and ''maybe I am not so afraid, as I am European -- German from Munich -- where we also left our door open'' when she was growing up, she says. ''It's a bit of a habit and maybe a bit of a dare, as I always considered myself lucky.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The time factor -- the notion that it is not necessary to lock if one is leaving the house for an hour or two, or traveling to a nearby town -- comes up often with No Lock People, even those who have reason to know better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steve is a 39-year-old security consultant who lives with his wife and two children in a ranch house in Nassau County, N.Y. He advises corporations and individuals about security systems; when he travels, he puts his valuables in the hotel room safe and carries a $5 bicycle lock for the balcony doors. There are plenty of lightweight valuables in his home that a thief could quickly make off with: three laptops, two DVD players, his wife's jewelry. But if he is leaving the house for an hour or two, to pick up his 7- and 11-year-olds at school or to go grocery shopping, he says, he doesn't bother to lock the door.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't know why, I just feel secure enough not to worry about it,'' he says. ''I would never counsel clients or the public to take the chances I do.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Can we examine the logic of this?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is no logic,'' he says. ''I think it's more of a feeling. If you don't have the sensation something is going to happen, it doesn't resonate in your mind.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet another story people tell themselves: Nothing is going to happen if I leave my house unlocked for only an hour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From a purely logistical standpoint, it is true that one is less likely to be burglarized if the door is open for one hour than if it is open for 24 hours, says Dr. David H. Krantz, a professor of psychology and statistics who is a director of the Center for Research on Environmental Decisions at Columbia University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is, however, a flaw in the logic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What they overlook is that if you do that repeatedly -- if you do it 24 times -- it's the same as doing it a total of 24 hours,'' Dr. Krantz says. It ''gives you the same probability, and yet people don't think of it that way.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OF course, different people have different notions of what constitutes safety.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sheri, a real estate broker and the single mother of a 3-year-old daughter, lives in Raleigh, N.C. She does not have a key to her one-and-a-half-story house, a point of contention with her daughter's father, who stands outside the house after he visits and will not leave until they lock the front door from inside.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To Sheri, this is pretty silly: she has a front and back door, a garage door and a sliding door in the master bedroom. If someone wanted to break in, she says, it would not be difficult, and living with unlocked doors is just much more convenient. When she goes on vacation, friends can easily get in to take care of her dog.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sure, she has valuables, but when it comes to being a Lock Person or a No Lock Person, Sheri believes it's more about a state of mind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When she was growing up in low-income housing in Madison, Wis., her mother always locked the door, Sheri says, but when she was put in her first foster home, out in the country, her foster family never locked the door.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My foster mom, she's very liberal, bleeding heart, one of those save-the-whales people,'' she says. ''It's people who are less cynical, see more of the good in the world than the bad: you're not worried about people breaking into your house.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sheri had a bad childhood?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I should be on Oprah,'' she says. ''I was one of those kids who was literally beaten and molested, and Mom used to lock us in the closet when she went out of town. So I've always told people a lock on the door is not going to stop a bad guy or whatever they want to do. It's kind of a relativity thing. I feel safe -- I know where 'not safe' is and what 'not safe' feels like.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So Sheri feels safer in an unlocked house?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You double as a psychologist?'' Sheri says. ''But that really is where it is at, and it makes a lot of sense.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If she's not concerned about personal safety, what about her valuables?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What I found growing up in foster homes is everything is replaceable except people, and God has a time and a place for people, and I can't stop that, either. No door or lock is going to stop where I meet my end.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cover article on Jan. 10 about 31 Places to Go in 2010 misidentified the opposing sides in the civil war that plagued Sri Lanka for a quarter century. The war was between the Sinhalese-dominated government and a separatist Tamil group, not between the Sinhalese majority and the Tamil minority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The article also misstated the length of time of a train trip between Hong Kong and Shenzhen and misidentified the type of train used. The trip is by commuter train, not by a bullet train, and the trip to Shenzhen from Hong Kong usually takes under 45 minutes, not an hour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the article referred incorrectly to the area of Montenegro in which a beach and an island are located. Velika Plaza, an eight-mile beach, and the island of Ada Bojana are on the southern edges of Montenegro, not the northern edges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Sun Jan 24 2010</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. Sri Lanka</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a quarter century, Sri Lanka seems to have been plagued by misfortune, including a brutal civil war between the Sinhalese majority and Tamil minority. But the conflict finally ended last May, ushering in a more peaceful era for this teardrop-shaped island off India's coast, rich in natural beauty and cultural splendors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The island, with a population of just 20 million, feels like one big tropical zoo: elephants roam freely, water buffaloes idle in paddy fields and monkeys swing from trees. And then there's the pristine coastline. The miles of sugary white sand flanked by bamboo groves that were off-limits to most visitors until recently are a happy, if unintended byproduct of the war.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the most scenic, if difficult stretches to reach, is Nilaveli Beach in the Tamil north. While a few military checkpoints remain, vacationers can lounge on poolside hammocks under palm trees or snorkel in its crystal-clear waters. Or they can order cocktails at the Nilaveli Beach Hotel (www.tangerinehotels.com/nilavelibeach[http://www.tangerinehotels.com/nilavelibeach]), a collection of recently renovated bungalows with private terraces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An international airport in Matara, on the island's southern shore, is under construction, which will make the gorgeous beaches near the seaside village of Galle easier to get to. Decimated by the tsunami in 2004, the surrounding coastline is now teeming with stylish guesthouses and boutique hotels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unawatuna, a crescent-shaped beach a few miles south of Galle, may be furthest along. Higher-end hotels there include Thambapanni Retreat (www.thambapanni.biz[http://www.thambapanni.biz]), which features four-poster beds, yoga and an ayurvedic spa. The Sun House (www.thesunhouse.com[http://www.thesunhouse.com]), in Galle, looks like a place where the Queen of England might stay, with its mango courtyard and colonial decor. One stylish place tucked within Galle's city walls is the Galle Fort Hotel (www.galleforthotel.com[http://www.galleforthotel.com]), a refurbished gem merchant's house run by a couple of Aussies. -- Lionel Beehner</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2. Patagonia Wine Country</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ten years ago, a group of adventurous winemakers set their sights on an Argentine valley called San Patricio del Chanar, an unusually fertile and eerily beautiful corner of Patagonia. They plowed, planted and waited. The outcome? A blossoming wine country with delicious pinot noirs and malbecs and smartly designed wineries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the area's pioneers, the 2,000-acre <span class="companylink">Bodega del Fin del Mundo</span> (www.bodegadelfindelmundo.com[http://www.bodegadelfindelmundo.com]), which works with the influential wine consultant Michel Rolland, is racking up international medals for its complex merlot, cabernet and malbec blends. And NQN (bodeganqn.com.ar), which is associated with the Argentine oenologist Roberto de la Mota, has seen its 2006 Coleccion NQN Malbec get 92 points from Wine Enthusiast. Nearby is the new Valle Perdido winery (www.valleperdido.com.ar[http://www.valleperdido.com.ar]), which includes an 18-room resort surrounded by vineyards. At the spa, ask for antioxidant wine-infused treatments. -- Paola Singer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3. Seoul</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forget Tokyo. Design aficionados are now heading to Seoul.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They have been drawn by the Korean capital's glammed-up cafes and restaurants, immaculate art galleries and monumental fashion palaces like the sprawling outpost of Milan's 10 Corso Como and the widely noted Ann Demeulemeester store -- an avant-garde Chia Pet covered in vegetation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And now Seoul, under its design-obsessed mayor, Oh Se-hoon, is the 2010 World Design Capital. The title, bestowed by a prominent council of industrial designers, means a year's worth of design parties, exhibitions, conferences and other revelries. Most are still being planned (go to wdc2010.seoul.go.kr for updates). A highlight will no doubt be the third annual Seoul Design Fair (Sept. 17 to Oct. 7), the city's answer to the design weeks in Milan and New York, which last year drew 2.5 million people and featured a cavalcade of events under two enormous inflatable structures set up at the city's Olympic stadium. -- Aric Chen</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4. Mysore</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You've completed 200 hours of teacher training, mastered flying crow pose and even spent a week at yoga surf camp. What's next? Yogis seeking transcontinental bliss head these days to Mysore, the City of Palaces, in southern India.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The yogi pilgrimage was sparked by Ashtanga yoga, a rigorous sweat-producing, breath-synchronized regimen of poses popularized by the beloved Krishna Pattabhi Jois, who died at 94 in 2009. Mr. Jois's grandson is now director of the Ashtanga Yoga Research Institute (www.kpjayi.org[http://www.kpjayi.org]). First month's tuition is 27,530 rupees, or $600 at 46 rupees to the dollar. Classes generally require a one-month commitment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Too much time or money? Mysore's yoga boom now has shalas catering to every need. Off the mat, the yoga tribe hobnobs at Anu's Bamboo Hut or the Regaalis Hotel pool, studies Sanskrit, gets an ayurveda treatment or tours the maharaja's palace. -- Mary Billard</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">5. Copenhagen</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As thousands of environmentalists heckled world leaders in Copenhagen last month for the climate summit, a solitary unifying note could be heard amid the cacophony of discord: the Danish capital has already emerged as one of the world's greenest -- and maybe coolest -- cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Copenhageners don't simply preach the ''progressive city'' ethos, they live it. Long, flat urban thoroughfares are hemmed with bicycle paths where locals glide around the city, tourists saddle up on the free bikes that dot the city center, and fashion bloggers take notes on the latest cycle chic (see copenhagencyclechic.com). Over in the harbor district, a public bath at Osterbro, due to open in 2010, will complement the two swimming areas set off on Copenhagen's inner harbor, a formerly polluted waterway recently transformed into the city's summertime hub.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Away from all the modernism and the happy cyclists, cultural thrill-seekers are being coaxed to the once dangerous district of Norrebro, which has arguably become Copenhagen's edgiest hub. A heady mix of hipsters, students and immigrants mingle in the cafes and galleries around the district's focal square, Sankt Hans Torv, and the city's young and excitable night owls can be found dancing in local clubs until the early hours. -- Benji Lanyado</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WAITING IN THE WINGS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">6. Koh Kood</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is this the next Koh Samui? The Trat islands are emerging as Thailand's new luxury outpost. Inaccessible for many years because of tensions with neighboring Cambodia and a poor transportation infrastructure, islands like Koh Kood are starting to draw venturesome paradise seekers, thanks in part to new direct flights to the port city of Trat. The recent opening of Soneva Kiri, a 42-villa suite retreat by the Six Senses brand (www.sixsenses.com/Soneva-Kiri[http://www.sixsenses.com/Soneva-Kiri]), definitely ratchets up the high-end quotient on this Robinson Crusoe-like island. Coming soon: X2 Koh Kood (www.x2resorts.com[http://www.x2resorts.com]), a designer eco-resort with 14 pool villas. -- Gisela Williams</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">7. Damascus</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next Marrakesh? Perhaps mindful of the way that renovations of historic riads have drawn upscale travelers to Marrakesh, Damascus hoteliers are trying to mine tourism gold in the rundown buildings of the Syrian capital's Old City. These 18th-century homes -- many with inviting courtyards and rooftop terraces -- are now boutique hotels, like the nine-room Old Vine (www.oldvinehotel.com[http://www.oldvinehotel.com]) and the Hanania (www.hananiahotel.com[http://www.hananiahotel.com]), which doubles as a hotel and a small museum. -- Don Duncan</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">8. Cesme</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next Bodrum? While revelers continue to descend upon that seaside retreat, another corner of Turkey's Aegean coastline has begun to emerge as a stylish alternative: the once-sleepy villages of the Cesme Peninsula. The main draw is Alacati, a sheltered beach town that last summer was the site of the Professional Windsurfers Association Slalom World Cup. Scheduled to open in the spring, the seven-room Hotel Nars Alacati (www.nars.com.tr[http://www.nars.com.tr]), set in a converted 19th-century mansion, promises to become the popular weekend gathering spot for Istanbul's smart set, along with the adjoining garden restaurant, MesaLuna. -- Andrew Ferren</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">9. Antarctica</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This may be the last year that Antarctica is open to mass tourism -- not because the ice is melting too fast (though it is), but because of restrictions that would severely curtail travel around the fragile continent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until recently, most vessels passing through Antarctica were limited to scientific expeditions, but an exploding number of tourists now flock to what is arguably the world's last great wilderness. The tourism boom, scientists argue, poses a major environmental threat. Indeed, several passenger ships have run aground in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Countries that manage Antarctica are calling for limits on the number of tourist ships, for fortified hulls that can withstand sea ice and for a ban on the use of so-called heavy oils. A ban on heavy oil, which is expected to be adopted by the International Maritime Organization later this year, would effectively block big cruise ships.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the new rules taking effect within two years, tour operators are promoting 2010 as the last year to visit Antarctica, while, at the same time, procuring lighter vessels that would be permitted. Abercrombie &amp;Kent, for example, is introducing a new ship, Le Boreal (www.abercrombiekent.com[http://www.abercrombiekent.com]), which its public relations firm argues ''meets all the environmental regulations, so access to Antarctica via A&amp;K will not be affected.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Launching this year, the compact luxury ship holds 199 passengers and features an outdoor heated pool, steam rooms and private balconies that offer intimate views of some of the world's remaining glaciers. -- Denny Lee</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">10. Leipzig</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2010, Leipzig, a small industrial city in the former East Germany with an illustrious past, will be marking the 325th anniversary of the birth of its former resident Johann Sebastian Bach and the 200th birthday of Robert Schumann with concerts, festivals and a reopened Bach Museum (www.bach-leipzig.de[http://www.bach-leipzig.de]).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the city's cultural high note is likely to be the Neo Rauch retrospective opening in April at the Leipzig Museum of Fine Arts (www.mdbk.de[http://www.mdbk.de]), a show devoted to the father of the New Leipzig School of artists, a scene that for the past decade has been the toast of the contemporary art world. The art cognoscenti will also make their way to the Spinnerei (www.spinnerei.de[http://www.spinnerei.de]), a former cotton mill that is home to 11 galleries, a cafe and a quirky new pension called the Meisterzimmer (www.meisterzimmer.de[http://www.meisterzimmer.de]), with rooms starting at 50 euros, or $70 at $1.40 to the euro.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city is also making a splash on the musical front. Moon Harbour Recordings and Kann Records, two indie labels producing innovative electronica from D.J.'s, are based here. Sevensol and Matthias Tanzmann will undoubtedly be lugging their laptops to Leipzig Pop Up (www.leipzig-popup.de[http://www.leipzig-popup.de]), a trade fair and music festival taking place in May. Otherwise, gigs can be heard year-round in the city's underbelly of abandoned factories and squats that look a lot like Berlin -- maybe 10 years ago. -- Gisela Williams</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">11. Los Angeles</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Visitors love to bemoan the lack of an old-fashioned cultural neighborhood in Los Angeles. In truth, the city has as many thriving art spots as it does ZIP codes. Last October, the pioneering Culver City gallery Blum &amp;Poe (2727 South La Cienega Boulevard; 310-836-2062; www.blumandpoe.com[http://www.blumandpoe.com]) inaugurated an airy 21,000-square-foot space; in July, the veteran local dealer Thomas Solomon (427 Bernard Street; 323-427-1687; www.thomassolomongallery.com[http://www.thomassolomongallery.com]) opened a space in Chinatown. And the powerhouse New York galleries L&amp;M Arts and Matthew Marks are scheduled to open prominent spaces in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local museums, many of which struggled financially in recent years, are back afloat. The Museum of Contemporary Art (www.moca.org[http://www.moca.org]) is celebrating its 30th birthday with a huge exhibition of 500 highlights from its outstanding collection of postwar art. In October, the vast Los Angeles County Museum of Art (www.lacma.org[http://www.lacma.org]) will get even bigger when it unveils a Renzo Piano-designed addition to its multiacre mid-Wilshire campus. And the billionaire collector Eli Broad, who has been both savior and villain to just about every major museum in town, is now looking to plant his own museum in Beverly Hills, Santa Monica or a third unnamed location. -- Andrew Ferren</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">12. Shanghai</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To many, the idea of a World Expo might seem like a dated, superfluous throwback from some preglobalized age. (Remember the one in Aichi, Japan? Enough said.) But tell that to the 70 million who are expected to attend Expo 2010 in Shanghai.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is China, after all. And following up on Beijing's spectacular Olympics, Shanghai is pulling out all the stops. From May 1 to Oct. 31, more than 200 national and other pavilions will straddle the city's Huangpu River, turning a two-square-mile site into an architectural playground: Switzerland will be represented by a building shaped like a map of that country, complete with a rooftop chairlift, while England is in the celebrated hands of the designer Thomas Heatherwick, who is fashioning what looks like a big, hairy marshmallow. Other attention grabbers include Macao, taking the form of a walk-through bunny, and the United Arab Emirates, which hired Foster + Partners to build a ''sand dune.'' (By contrast, the United States pavilion might be mistaken for a suburban office park.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the run-up to the Expo, Shanghai seems to have taken this year's theme, ''Better City, Better Life,'' to heart, spending tens of billions of dollars to upgrade the city. The riverfront Bund promenade is getting a makeover with parks and pedestrian-friendly sidewalks, while the subway is being dramatically expanded -- including several new stations serving the World Expo site. -- Aric Chen</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">13. Mumbai</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the one-year anniversary of the 2008 Mumbai attacks, citizens painted a one-kilometer stretch of wall in South Mumbai with murals to show their love and hope for the city. The initiative, by a group of organizations that included the Mumbai Arts Project (MAP), which is dedicated to creating public art projects, is just one sign that Mumbai's art scene is on the rebound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A walk through the newly dubbed Colaba Art District yields no fewer than five contemporary art galleries. In the second half of 2009, two contemporary galleries opened: Gallery BMB (www.gallerybmb.com[http://www.gallerybmb.com]), which brought in big-name artists from around the globe for its first show (look for an exhibition focusing on new Indian women artists, starting on Feb. 8), and Volte (www.volte.in[http://www.volte.in]), a gallery, cafe and bookstore. Just down the street is Project 88 (www.project88.in[http://www.project88.in]), an outpost of Gallery 88 in Calcutta, focused on up-and-coming Indian and South Asian artists. The large, simple one-room space will show the artist Hemali Bhuta with an installation on the ceiling and archival prints on the walls, starting Jan. 18. Also nearby is Gallery Maskara (www.gallerymaskara.com[http://www.gallerymaskara.com]), in a converted cotton storehouse; starting March 15, the space will host paintings, sculpture and watercolors by T. Venkanna, a popular artist based in nearby Vadodara. -- Lindsay Clinton</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">14. Minorca</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the beat of disco pounds in Ibiza and Majorca, their quiet sister Minorca offers a tranquil contrast to the glitz next door. The entire island is a Unesco Biosphere Reserve, so the Spanish megahotel development frenzy of the last decade has largely skipped over this patch of the Mediterranean. That means miles of beaches --some 120 of them, in fact, like the northern sweep of crystal-clear swimming waters in the coves called Cala d'Algaiarens, with fine sand and rolling dunes. And Minorca's eco-diversity extends well beyond the coasts: forests, deep gorges, wetlands, salt marshes and hillsides covered in lush greenery that sometimes look more New England than Mediterranean. Even the island's sun-bleached towns -- Mahon and Ciutadella, each combining elements of their British colonial heritage, Moorish roots and modern Spanish identity -- are more peaceful than their Majorcan equivalents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ideal visit to Minorca celebrates islanders' emphasis on agritourism -- sleeping in rural establishments like Ca Na Xini (www.canaxini.com[http://www.canaxini.com]), a dairy farm that offers an eight-room temple to modernism inside the shell of a century-old manor home. It's like spring break for eco-conscious adults. -- Sarah Wildman</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">15. Costa Rica</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Costa Rica has been on any eco-minded traveler's radar for years, but with a new birding route in the northeast region of the country, there's a new reason to pay the country a visit. Opened in early 2009, the Costa Rican Bird Route (www.costaricanbirdroute.com[http://www.costaricanbirdroute.com]) encompasses 13 far-flung nature reserves with phenomenal avian diversity -- the sites are home to more than 500 bird species. Travelers can explore the route on their own with a map ($12.95 when ordered online) or hire a local guide to lead the way. The most popular leg of the route centers on the Sarapiqui-San Carlos region, one of the last remaining habitats of the endangered and prized great green macaw. The landscape along the route runs from wetlands and river explorations to high rain forest canopies and waterfalls; birders can visit renowned tropical biological research stations, stay in newly built eco-lodges and hike or canoe through local family-run reserves in search of rare raptors, herons and kingfishers. -- Bonnie Tsui</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">16. Marrakesh</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ancient walls of Marrakesh must have protected the city from the global recession. Luxury boutique hotels, which began opening a few years ago, are now popping like Champagne corks over this historic and atmospheric North African city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">La Mamounia, a famed playground for celebrities like Mick Jagger and Charlie Chaplin, reopened in November after a $176 million face-lift by the Parisian designer Jacques Garcia (www.mamounia.com[http://www.mamounia.com]). At its dazzling launch party, Jennifer Aniston, Orlando Bloom and Gwyneth Paltrow walked the red carpet, Jose Carreras sang, and Cirque du Soleil acrobats wrapped in Christmas lights scaled the hotel walls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There was caviar galore,'' said Sandra Zwollo, a Dutch expatriate who lived in La Mamounia for three years. ''And not only does the new La Mamounia reflect what is happening in Marrakesh at the moment, it is greatly contributing to it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Zwollo herself is adding to the glamour of the city. Later this month, she plans to open Harem (www.harem-escape.com[http://www.harem-escape.com]), a wellness retreat just for women, set on a stunning 12-acre estate in the city's outskirts surrounded by olive and palm groves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it all pales in comparison to the palatial Royal Mansour, scheduled to open in 2010. Owned by King Mohammed VI of Morocco, who is largely responsible for the country's newfound glamour, the jaw-dropping resort is built along the city's ancient walls and has been designed almost like a mini-medina with Andalusian-style courtyards. The 20,000-square-foot royal suite will have a private swimming pool, home theater, gym and private hammam. The resort will also feature three restaurants overseen by the three-star Michelin chef Yannick Alleno.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's more. By the end of 2010, the Mandarin Oriental Jnan Rahma, which looks like something out of a Merchant-Ivory movie, and a 140-room Four Seasons are both expected to open, while a Rocco Forte resort and W Hotel are in the works for 2011. -- Gisela Williams</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">17. Las Vegas</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite a 4 percent drop in visitors in 2009, and the fact that several Las Vegas hotels have drastically slashed their rates to attract bargain-seeking travelers, a number of ambitious developers seem to think there is still money to be made in Sin City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CityCenter, MGM's $8.5 billion, 67-acre resort complex, is the Strip's biggest headliner in 2010. Four of the six planned properties opened in December, including three hotels and a 500,000-square-foot luxury shopping mall (www.citycenter.com[http://www.citycenter.com]). The residential Veer Towers and the Harmon, a 400-room boutique hotel, are scheduled to open this year. The complex also houses Haze, a 25,000-square-foot nightclub, and Cirque du Soleil's seventh show, ''Viva Elvis,'' a tribute to the king of rock 'n' roll.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This summer, the Encore, a Steve Wynn property, is unveiling an entertainment complex and ''beach club'' (complete with three pools and V.I.P. cabanas)., and a new nightclub, Surrender. A five-pool addition to Garden of the Gods Pool Oasis at Caesars Palace, set to open in March, will feature swim-up gaming and an 18-foot waterfall. The Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, which unveiled its Paradise Tower in July, added the all-suite HRH Tower in late December, as well as Vanity, a 14,000-square-foot nightclub. -- Allison Busacca</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">18. Bahia</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All eyes will turn to sultry Rio de Janeiro when it hosts the 2016 Olympic Games, but right now Brazil's white-hot destination may be the northeastern state of Bahia. With its distinctive African-influenced flavors, cultural diversity, palm-fringed beaches and a new crop of chic hotels, the region is fast emerging as a jet-set playground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the village of Trancoso, a hideaway that gets more fashionable by the minute, the Dutch designer Wilbert Das (longtime creative director of the Diesel label) opened Uxua Casa Hotel (www.uxua.com[http://www.uxua.com]) using recycled materials including old roof tiles and abandoned fishing boats. The hotel's colorful casas and lush gardens were a canvas for the 2010 Pirelli calendar, shot by the bad-boy photographer Terry Richardson. Speaking of the town's rising cachet, a luxury Fasano resort -- with 30 beachfront villas, a restaurant and a spa -- is in the works.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Salvador, known for its pulsing street carnival and the historic Pelourinho district, head to one of the city's boutique lodgings. Zank (www.zankhotel.com.br[http://www.zankhotel.com.br]) recently opened in the residential Rio Vermelho section and seamlessly blends modern and classic styles, with exceptional views of the Atlantic Ocean just steps away. Nearby is the Pestana Bahia Lodge (www.pestana.com[http://www.pestana.com]), with a hilltop infinity pool and sunny sea-view rooms. While there, don't miss ''The Kiss'' and ''The Thinker'' by Auguste Rodin, on temporary view at the Palacete das Artes (palacetedasartesrodinbahia.blogspot.com), which opened a gallery devoted to the French sculptor. -- Paolo Singer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">19. Istanbul</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reputation of Istanbul's contemporary art scene has been steadily growing in recent years, with the Web site ArtKnowledgeNews.com recently calling it ''one of the most innovative in the world.'' That reputation is bound to be burnished even more this year, now that Istanbul has been named the 2010 European Capital of Culture (a designation it shares with Essen, Germany, and Pecs, Hungary).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There will be a series of events, gallery shows and stage performances throughout the city to mark the occasion. (A complete list of events can be found at en.istanbul2010.org/index.htm.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But one of the best ways to get a crash course in what Istanbul's leading artists are up to right now is to spend some time wandering around the Misir Apartments (311/4 Istiklal Cadessi), right on the busy pedestrian thoroughfare that cuts through the trendy Beygolu neighborhood. Inside this elegant, early-20th-century building are some of the city's most cutting-edge art venues, like Galerist (www.galerist.com.tr[http://www.galerist.com.tr]) and Gallerie Nev (www.galerinevistanbul.com[http://www.galerinevistanbul.com])</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Afterward, head to the rooftop terrace and have a drink at 360 Istanbul, a stylish bar and restaurant that offers stunning views of the city's skyline (360istanbul.com). -- Stuart Emmrich</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">20. Shenzhen</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chances are, the iPod in your pocket was made in Shenzhen, China. But this industrial powerhouse of a city on the Pearl River Delta in the southern region of the country, is more than just a factory town of sweatshops and bad smog -- and it has the high-class hotels and high rollers to prove it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shenzhen is one of China's wealthiest cities, right up there with Shanghai and Beijing. Situated just a one-hour bullet train ride north of Hong Kong, the thriving city exemplifies China's breakneck transformation from peasant economy to capitalist giant. Its rapid rise can be traced back to 1979, when Deng Xiaoping selected the sleepy fishing port as a special economic zone. Money, bulldozers and cheap labor poured in. Dim sum joints and illicit massage parlors gave way to gleaming shopping malls and faceless skyscrapers. A city of 14 million sprang up seemingly overnight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So did a new travel destination. A 491-room Grand Hyatt (1881 Baoan Nan Road; www.shenzhen.grand.hyatt.com[http://www.shenzhen.grand.hyatt.com]), with bay views, recently opened, joining the ranks of the Kempinski Hotel Shenzhen (Hai De San Dao, Hou Hai Bin Road; www.kempinski.com/shenzhen[http://www.kempinski.com/shenzhen]) and a Shangri-La (1002 Jianshe Road; www.shangri-la.com/shenzhen[http://www.shangri-la.com/shenzhen]). Even late-night massage parlors have gone upscale and legit. The Queen Spa (Chunfeng Road; www.queenspa.cn[http://www.queenspa.cn]) has sleeping pods, a theater and a juice bar -- all for under $15 a night -- plus massages that start at about $25.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Affordable luxuries extend to shopping and eating. The jumble of stalls at Dongmen are clogged with pirated DVDs and knock-off handbags, while there are new fashionable restaurants in Shekou, a leafy district with an expatriate flavor. Shenzhen is getting greener, too. The city recently welcomed the first LEED-certified building in southern China: the aptly named Horizontal Skyscraper, billed to be as long as the Empire State Building is tall. -- Lionel Beehner</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">21. Macedonia</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the deepest lakes on the planet, with a dazzling Unesco World Heritage site of ancient dwellings rising high above its shores, Lake Ohrid in Macedonia is a local vacation star poised for greater international acclaim.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the tiered, terra-cotta-roofed city of Ohrid, 18 miles from the Albanian border, a lakefront settlement dating back to Neolithic times, Macedonians boast that on their side of the lake is a church, monastery or mosque for every day of the year, each full of resplendent frescoes, mosaics and icons. Notable attractions include the recently renovated church of St. Clement and St. Panteleimon at Plaosnik, an epic Byzantine masterpiece, and the 13th-century St. John of Kaneo, a limestone and brick monastery that juts out over transparent blue waters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An estimated $50 million renovation of the Ohrid Airport is planned for 2010, with more international flights expected by summer, and up to six new luxury hotels are in the works, including a $33 million property with construction scheduled to begin in March. Tourist attractions on Ohrid's beaches were upgraded last year with swank bars and dining spots complimented by bamboo and leather couchettes, with the hot spot Cuba Libre (www.cubalibreohrid.com[http://www.cubalibreohrid.com]) leading the way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, new government-financed archaeological digs around the lake regularly unearth treasures, like the 17 fifth-century tombs discovered last July. The find follows the 2008 opening of the Museum on Water, a re-created Bronze Age village built on stilts incorporating Ohrid artifacts. -- Dinah Spritzer</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">22. South Africa</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As host of the 2010 World Cup this summer, South Africa has gotten its game on with a flurry of new stadiums, new hotels and safari lodges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While soccer is being played across nine cities, much of the action off the field is taking place in Cape Town. Already known for its stunning beaches, mouthwatering cuisine and sophisticated night life, the city is welcoming high-end hotels, including the recently opened One &amp;Only Cape Town and the forthcoming Taj Cape Town (www.tajhotels.com/capetown[http://www.tajhotels.com/capetown]). Set to open this month, the Taj will have 166 rooms, many with views of Table Mountain. Also scheduled to open in Cape Town this year -- but not in time for the World Cup -- is the second branch of the nascent Missoni Hotels group (the first property opened in Edinburgh last year, with future outposts planned for Kuwait, Brazil and Oman).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between matches, there's plenty of time to go on a safari. If money is no object, check out the Ulusaba (www.ulusaba.virgin.com[http://www.ulusaba.virgin.com]), a private game reserve that's part of Richard Branson's collection of luxury vacation properties. It has opened the new Cliff Lodge, with private swimming pools and spectacular views of the bush. Prices start at 13,800 South African rand (around $1,878 at 7.35 rand to the dollar) a night for two. -- Denny Lee</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">23. Breckenridge</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ski resort of Breckenridge is not content to be merely the party capital of the Colorado Rockies -- now it wants to be the Amsterdam, too. For its 150th birthday, the former mining town -- known for its anything-goes reputation among ski fanatics -- recently passed an ordinance to decriminalize possession of small amounts of marijuana.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even without the law, Breckenridge has plenty going for it, and not just the town's main strip, which is already an apres-ski bonanza of Irish joints, upscale restaurants and boutique shops. The BreckConnect Gondola now whisks skiers from town to the slopes in a matter of minutes. And the bases at Peak 7 and Peak 8 are barely recognizable from a few years back. A case in point is the recently opened Grand Lodge on Peak 7 (866-664-9782; www.grandlodgeonpeak7.com[http://www.grandlodgeonpeak7.com]), which just rolled out a full-service spa and fitness center called Soothe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't expect any Amsterdam-style ''coffee shops'' near the slopes anytime soon: the new ordinance applies only to the town of Breckenridge, not the mountain. -- Lionel Beehner</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">24. Montenegro</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the southern edges of Montenegro, almost at the border of Albania, is an unusual land formation: a powdery, eight-mile-long beach called Velika Plaza (Long Beach) and a triangular island where the Bojana River meets the sea. The island is called Ada Bojana, and the area is quickly becoming a party destination for the young surfer set.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the fantastic weather and soft gray beaches have drawn Eastern Europeans for decades, breezy thermal winds are bringing kitesurfers from Germany, England and France, who are turning Velika Plaza into a wave-riding capital on the Adriatic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cheap beer doesn't hurt, either. The area is so undeveloped that the only resort is a faded nudist camp popular with Germans. In the meantime, travelers who want to keep their clothes on can book a 26-euro room (about $37, at $1.40 to the euro) at the Hotel Mediteran (hotel-mediteran.com) in the small city of Ulcinj, a 15-minute water taxi ride north. --Gisela Williams</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">25. Vancouver Island</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vancouver will have the sporting world's attention when it hosts the Winter Olympics this year, but the most rewarding outdoor exploration is found outside the city, away from the crowds and off the beaten path. Hop the <span class="companylink">BC Ferry</span> (www.bcferries.com[http://www.bcferries.com]) from Vancouver to Nanaimo, on Vancouver Island's east coast, and drive three hours through mountain passes to the wild, dramatic west coast. The new Wild Pacific Trail (www.wildpacifictrail.com[http://www.wildpacifictrail.com]) skirts the rocky, rugged shoreline, overlooking sandy coves lined with driftwood and tidepools and the Pacific beyond them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hiking trail is being built in sections (there are three of seven set up so far), hand-cut through dense old-growth forests of cedar and spruce, with viewing platforms that let hikers see turn-of-the-20th-century lighthouses, kayakers heading to nearby islands, and the annual gray whale migration (about 20,000 pass by the island from February to late May). The base for the Wild Pacific Trail is a folksy fishing village called Ucluelet, a former First Nations settlement dotted with seaside inns, bed-and-breakfasts and beach cabins like the Terrace Beach Resort (www.terracebeachresort.ca[http://www.terracebeachresort.ca]), which has direct access to the trail.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfairly or not, Colombia is still known for its cocaine cartels and street violence, but cool-hunting travelers are calling it Latin America's next affordable hot spot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bogota, its capital, has emerged as a role model of urban reinvention. Starting in the late 1990s, the city underwent a breathtaking transformation. Sidewalks, once used mainly for parking, are now lined with bicycle paths and tree-shaded cafes. An innovative bus system zips residents across the traffic-congested city. And museums and restaurants have opened in its historic center, including the refurbished Museo del Oro, which houses pre-Columbian treasures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Getting there is affordable, too. <span class="companylink">JetBlue</span> recently began nonstop daily service to Bogota from Orlando, Fla., joining other carriers including Delta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the picturesque coastal city of Cartagena, a Unesco World Heritage site, which has been experiencing a tourism surge in recent years, gets even more stylish. The latest addition is the Tcherassi Hotel + Spa (www.tcherassihotels.com[http://www.tcherassihotels.com]), a seven-room boutique hotel designed by Silvia Tcherassi, a Colombian fashion designer. It has even prompted some travel bloggers to call Cartagena the next Buenos Aires. -- Denny Lee</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">27. Kitzbuhel</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most Austrians know the Austrian town of Kitzbuhel as nothing less than a ski paradise, with 53 lifts and 104 miles of powdery slopes. But in the past few years, Kitzbuhel has started to earn a reputation for its high-end dining -- three restaurants with Michelin stars, with two more Michelin-starred joints outside town -- making this small Alpine village of just 8,439 inhabitants an up-and-coming attraction for food lovers as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the most celebrated kitchens are in hotels, like the five-star Hotel Tennerhof (www.tennerhof.com[http://www.tennerhof.com]), with one Michelin star and three Gault-Millau toques, and the Hotel Schwarzer Adler, which houses the Neuwirt restaurant (www.restaurant-neuwirt.at[http://www.restaurant-neuwirt.at]), serving updated Central European fare like goose liver with baked almond milk and plums. The A-Rosa resort and spa (www.resort.a-rosa.de[http://www.resort.a-rosa.de]), is host to no fewer than three restaurants, including KAPS, which was awarded its Michelin star in November 2008 and is known for its ''Poor Man's Menu,'' a set dinner of traditional recipes from the region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The highest fliers, however, seem to hide outside the village: Rosengarten, the only restaurant in the area to earn two Michelin stars (it was upgraded to two in 2009), is less than four miles away in Kirchberg. From there, it is about a 30-minute drive to Restaurant Schindlhaus (www.schindlhaus.com[http://www.schindlhaus.com]) in Soll, where the Winkler brothers, Christian and Markus, run a kitchen known for its dedication to local ingredients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Naturally, you can't expect meals at a top ski destination to go cheap. If the high-end prices are beyond your means, try something a little more bucolic: the barn at the 400-year-old Stanglwirt hotel (www.stanglwirt.com[http://www.stanglwirt.com]), where a lovely stube, or pub, serves schnitzel and goulash next to grazing cows. -- Evan Rail</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">28. Norway</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With an acclaimed new opera house and plenty of high-end dining options, Oslo is already a must-visit urban destination. But this year the focus should be on the wilds of the Norwegian countryside. With its dazzling Nordic light and dramatic landscape, Norway is perhaps the most unexplored and exotic corner of Europe. Having convinced the world that its fjords and southern coastline make the country a great summer getaway, Norwegians have begun showcasing its charms as a winter destination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Specialized trekking and ski tours like those offered by the Lyngen Lodge (www.lyngenlodge.com[http://www.lyngenlodge.com]) can open up pristine areas of the north like the stunning Lyngen Alps, with high-speed boats to shuttle across the fjord to ski trails that would otherwise be inaccessible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the country's indifference to trendy boutique hotels and splashy resorts -- long the lament of global tourism professionals -- is just what appeals to a more discerning clientele. Bespoke travel specialists like Ziniry (www.ziniry.com[http://www.ziniry.com]) excel at getting visitors deep into the scenery. Who needs a penthouse suite when you can book a lighthouse on a private island? -- Andrew Ferren</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">29. Gargano</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Far from the madding crowds of Amalfi and Cinque Terre, the Italian peninsula of Gargano sits on the Adriatic and boasts a checklist of summer-perfect Italian holiday options. The offerings are largely a part of the protected Gargano National Park, a swath of terrain encompassing everything from the oak and beech Foresta Umbra to the sheer chalk-colored cliffs and grottoes of the coast's Caribbean-clear waters to the postcard-worthy whitewashed villages that hug the sea. Twelve nautical miles offshore, accessible by boat and hydrofoil, are the Tremiti Islands, specks of land surrounded by a wealth of sea life and a marine reserve of their own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking for Romanesque churches and seaside fisherman's restaurants? Try Peschici and Vieste, larger than fishing villages but cozier than cities, with white walls and medieval centers. How about mountain hiking? Check. Gargano also offers the rarest of luxuries: fabulous food and lodging on the cheap -- campsites offer space for mere pocket change, while hotel rooms can be had for 30 to 60 euros a night ($42 to $84 at $1.40 to the euro) in Peschici. If saving on food is wallet-friendly enough, pay a bit more than 100 euros and stay at the Chiusa delle More (www.lachiusadellemore.it[http://www.lachiusadellemore.it]), a 16th-century farmhouse in the national park but still only yards from the sea. Meals are locavore, Gargano style, incorporating the farm's own vegetables and eggs. -- Sarah Wildman</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">30. Kuala Lumpur</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Phuket and Angkor Wat are tourism anchors in Southeast Asia, jetsetters in the region are heading these days to Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital that's quietly evolved into one of the area's coolest and friendliest cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not only are K.L.-ites diehard foodies, fiercely proud of a robust street food scene that straddles Chinese, Indian and Malay flavors -- check out the food blog EatingAsia (www.eatingasia.typepad.com[http://www.eatingasia.typepad.com]) -- they're also shopaholics, spending weekends trawling boutiques for the latest looks emerging from the sophisticated local fashion scene.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The country's media-appointed King of Fashion is Bernard Chandran, who recently stole the spotlight when Lady Gaga wore one of his candy-pink minidresses to an awards show in London. His concept store is at the KL Plaza on Jalan Bukit Bintang. Another designer to look out for is Khoon Hooi, known for streamlined yet feminine dresses in muted tones, sold at his flagship store in the ritzy Starhill Gallery; and Melinda Looi, who makes vintage-inspired cocktail dresses from chiffon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bloggers at Tongue in Chic keep vigilant watch over the city's fashion temples, which are clustered along the streets of Jalan Telawi 2 and 3 in the suburb of Bangsar, a 15-minute cab ride from the city center. To showcase the young designers, the blog recently started Chic POP, a flea market held every three months at one of K.L.'s most prestigious dance clubs, Zouk (www.zoukclub.com.my[http://www.zoukclub.com.my]). -- Naomi Lindt</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">31. Nepal</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">San Francisco, Amsterdam and Provincetown? Been there. Mykonos and Ibiza? Done that. Looking for the next gay destination? How about the Himalayan country of Nepal? Yes, Nepal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the roughly two years since the nation's supreme court ordered that gay, lesbians and transgendered people be afforded equal rights, this conservative, mostly-Hindu country appears to be moving ahead full throttle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gay friendly clubs now dot its capital. (Go to www.utopia-asia.com[http://www.utopia-asia.com] for listings.) A ''third gender'' category is an option on national I.D. cards. Recently, a transgender beauty queen even got a photo op with the prime minister. And now there's a tourist agency in Katmandu that is promoting gay tourism to Nepal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Started by Sunil Babu Pant, an openly-gay legislator, Pink Mountain Travels and Tours (www.pinkyatra.com[http://www.pinkyatra.com]) promises to marry adventure travel with gay weddings. With talk that Nepal may legalize same-sex marriage this year as the country hammers out a new constitution (and, perhaps more importantly, deals with recent bouts of civil unrest), Mr. Pant is offering to hold nuptials at the Mount Everest base camp, jungle safari honeymoons and bridal processions on elephant back. -- Aric Chen</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. White, 45, is the founder and president of <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>, a Manhattan-based market research company that tracks commercial real estate sales and trends globally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before starting R.C.A., in 2001, Mr. White spent 14 years working in real estate investment banking and as a broker, at Granite Partners, now called Savills, and at Eastdil Realty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. What prompted you to start the company?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. My friends on the Street --whether they are in M &amp;A or municipal bonds -- could always say, ''In my industry the volume last week was X-hundred billion.'' Down to the penny. Nobody knew how many office buildings were traded in any given year or how big the volume was in this marketplace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I started collecting information and publishing quarterly reports for clients, and as we traveled around pitching business, I could see their eyes light up when they saw this marketplace quantified. A lot of the standard metrics that Wall Street uses to analyze financial markets were applicable, and I thought, hmm ... there's something there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. What is R.C.A.'s main focus?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We focus exclusively on the capital side -- the sales. We have 108 countries where we're tracking deals right now. We have data partnerships and researchers, and throughout the staff we have 17, 18 language capabilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Let's get right to the numbers for the New York market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. In 2009, the investment market came to a near-standstill in Manhattan. For all property types, 2009 will be below $7 billion in terms of sales in the New York City metropolitan area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That compares with $77 billion in 2007, so we're at 10 percent of volume from two years ago. It's also a big drop-off from 2008, which wasn't a good year, either; in 2008, we had $26 billion in sales, which still earned us the No. 2 spot globally, behind Tokyo. When you think of it, $7 billion in deals is nothing -- it's not much more than the price for Stuyvesant Town.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Office sales are about $2.7 billion. In 2008, it was $15 billion, and at the peak, in 2007, it was $50 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. How many transactions?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. For office properties $5 million or greater in Manhattan, there were 23. In 2007, there were 188; and in 2008, 84.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. And for all property types?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. It's 86 transactions. In 2008, 250 transactions; and then the peak in 2007, it was 488 transactions, including some buildings that were traded twice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. What was the biggest deal?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. The biggest, and probably the most symbolic deal, was Worldwide Plaza. It was one of the last of the famous Macklowe Properties assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Where does New York rank globally right now?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. The bad news is Manhattan has been knocked off the perennial perch as the No. 1 market. It's not even in the top 10 of all property types -- it's down to No. 13. In the office sector, New York fell to No. 8.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Which cities precede it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Let's just talk office: there's London, Tokyo, Paris, Seoul, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Moscow. Even Moscow had more office sales than New York!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Do you find any of those markets of particular interest?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I'm watching very closely the pricing of office buildings in London, because that city is a very good template for where Manhattan is headed next. Manhattan and London have the world's largest financial, economic and cultural centers, so capital from all over the globe wants to be invested in real estate in usually one of those two markets. London started its downward descent maybe a year before New York, but in the past six months, and especially in the past 90 days, activity has exploded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Is there a similar rebound on the horizon in New York?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. A key factor in the turnaround in Europe has been foreign investors. They are responsible for about 80 percent of the deals in London over the past six months. And much of that money would like to be in New York. As cap rates fall in London and prices rise again, New York starts looking more attractive on a relative pricing basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Do you own real estate?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I own a brownstone on the Upper West Side. I bought it 15 years ago for $475,000, and used a second mortgage on it to start the company. Now I'm trying to decide: Should I renovate this place to a single-family, which could get the big bucks, or maybe hedge the bet and do a duplex?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For much of Shannon Fischer's 20 years, community change in her Bronzeville neighborhood has come in the form of a wrecking ball.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, the Ida B. Wells housing projects fell, then the Robert Taylor homes, and now, within view of her apartment at 33rd Street and Cottage Grove, Michael Reese Hospital is coming down. Destruction can often lead to reconstruction, but hopes that Bronzeville might be revitalized as the site of an Olympic Village died in October when Chicago lost its bid for the 2016 Summer Games.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The neighborhood's residential market took a severe hit, and developers have put off major investments. Few developers, it seems, can get serious about new projects in Bronzeville until the City of Chicago reveals plans for the landmark Michael Reese site, 37 acres at the heart of a potentially promising lakefront neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Fischer remains optimistic. Even though the blocks in her neighborhood alternate between new condominiums and empty lots, foot traffic is sparse -- and the only shopping center consists mostly of convenience stores and an auto repair shop -- she believes greater Bronzeville will have its day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think the neighborhood will continue to grow, considering there's different people, different races and age groups moving in,'' Ms. Fischer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bronzeville was once a thriving ''black metropolis'' with hundreds of black-owned businesses and a booming night life. Its population swelled during the great migration of Southern blacks seeking jobs after World War I.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The poet Gwendolyn Brooks lived there, and in 1945, her first book of poetry -- ''A Street in Bronzeville'' -- brought her instant critical acclaim. Other notable residents included Richard Wright, the author of ''Native Son,'' and the jazz pioneer Louis Armstrong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The area's decline began in the 1950s as it gradually lost its middle class and businesses started to close. Though Bronzeville is unlikely to reclaim its golden era, developers like Keith Giles see the potential for new growth, only he does not expect to reach it any time soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, Mr. Giles's firm, Kargil Development, told the city that it was interested in developing the Olympic Village. The project would have helped Olympics promoters realize their vision of a new neighborhood that could bridge the gap between the resurgent Bronzeville community and the South Loop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was an exciting development opportunity for an international event,'' Mr. Giles said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with the Olympics impetus gone, banks not lending and no other financing in sight, Mr. Giles does not expect action soon on a Michael Reese site that might cost $1 billion to redevelop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The development business right now is on sabbatical,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Mr. Giles's company considers another project nearby, it doesn't expect to see change soon.. ''Unfortunately, most everything has stopped,'' Mr. Giles said. ''There's new developments on one block, and you go across the street and there's a burned-out building.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alderman Toni Preckwinkle, whose Fourth Ward includes the Reese campus, expects the city to release its plan for the site early this year. She said that a developer might be selected by the end of the year, but that the first buildings would most likely not be completed until 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Preckwinkle also said developers would ''prefer a clear site'' around Michael Reese, casting further doubt on the efforts of preservationists who are fighting to save nearby buildings designed in consultation with the architect Walter Gropius, founder of the influential Bauhaus School.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bernita Johnson-Gabriel, executive director of the Quad Communities Development Corporation, a neighborhood group that serves the Kenwood, Oakland and Douglas neighborhoods that make up greater Bronzeville, said hurdles to development included concerns about crime that are rooted in racial stereotypes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are a neighborhood of color,'' Ms. Johnson-Gabriel said. ''There's a perception of crime that obviously doesn't quite exist here the way it is portrayed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, crime in the Douglas and neighboring Oakland neighborhoods fell steadily over the past decade, according to Chicago Police Department reports. Statistics show a 67 percent decline for Douglas -- to 1,074 crimes in 2009 from 3,290 in 1999 -- while Oakland's number fell by more than half, to fewer than 300 from 611.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the city's larger development groups are pushing ahead despite a lack of clarity about the city's plans. One, Draper and Kramer, is proceeding on a 70-acre development just south of Michael Reese that it began planning three years ago. In addition to 2,000 high-rise apartment units, the Lake Meadows project will feature renovation of existing rental units and condominiums, construction of single-family town homes and expansion of a small shopping center on the corner of 35th Street and Cottage Grove.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firm will keep a close eye on the city's plan for the Michael Reese site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are very interested because it's a large development and right next door to our property,'' said Donald Vitek, vice president of acquisitions and development for Draper and Kramer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some residents and developers want officials to move quickly on the city's plans for the Reese site, Mr. Vitek said a slower pace made sense. It will allow time to survey current community needs, he said, and possibly wait out a soured housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Douglas neighborhood's new condos and town homes are selling for as little as $125 a square foot, a steep discount from similar South Loop properties. But Mr. Vitek predicted a steady increase in demand once the market improves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An Olympics aftershock is hitting the market for existing homes in the neighborhood, too. Pam Dempsey, a real estate broker for Bronzeville Properties, said home sales came to a standstill during the Olympics bidding process, as property owners waited for the decision on a site. Only after the bid failed did they look to sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They're now entering into a down market,'' Ms. Dempsey said. Prices for single-family homes in the area have declined to $100,000 to $200,000 now from $200,000 to $400,000 in mid-2007, she said. A high foreclosure rate has made the Bronzeville downturn worse than what has hit the South Loop or Hyde Park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've experienced a lot of really, really deeply discounted foreclosures,'' Ms. Dempsey said. ''You'll have a house that needs a ton of work going for maybe $35,000.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When development does come, she said, Bronzeville will benefit most if the retail part appeals to the same kind of newly affluent residents as those who have moved into the South Loop and Hyde Park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Not the fast-food stuff we already have around here,'' Ms. Dempsey said, ''but nicer retail, like the stuff that came to the South Loop over the past 5 to 10 years. A wine shop or a cafe or bookstores -- these things will keep people in the neighborhood.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joseph Schwietermann, director of the Chaddick Institute for Metropolitan Development at DePaul University, warned against easy comparisons between Bronzeville and the Hyde Park and South Loop neighborhoods. He attributes a combination of poor post-World War II urban planning and Bronzeville's history of slow growth as factors that have made Bronzeville less successful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's easier to invest in housing with the hopes that retail will follow,'' Mr. Schwietermann said. But, he added, ''you can't assume that if you buildit, they will come.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October, contractors hired by the city began tearing down the first of seven buildings on the Michael Reese campus slated for demolition. The timeline for development is not urgent, a spokeswoman for the city's Department of Community Development said, because the city will not begin making mortgage payments on the property until 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The department envisions a large-scale residential and retail complex with a mixture of affordable and market-rate housing, in addition to dry cleaners, coffee shops and other staple businesses of neighborhood life. Its stated goal is ''to build a community from scratch,'' and stimulate redevelopment on the lakefront south of McCormick Place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Byron Lindsey, manager of an auto repair shop, has seen little retail growth around the garage he has managed for nearly 20 years in what is now the Lake Meadows shopping center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But his business is down only slightly despite the slow economy, Mr. Lindsey said as he juggled a phone in each hand and spoke to customers from behind the counter. He has perceived an influx of higher-income residents over the past five years, which he expects will contribute to a comeback once the economy recovers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Redevelopment of the Michael Reese property could be the key.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It could really determine whether the community gets a kick-start on its way back,'' Mr. Lindsey said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REAL estate agents often chant the mantra ''location, location, location,'' which essentially means ''find a home in a well-kept neighborhood with good schools and a low crime rate.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some may cite a fourth factor, ''walkability,'' a concept supported by self-styled ''new urbanists'' who advocate denser cities designed for the pedestrian and mass transit as much as for the car. In their ideal neighborhood, you could walk to a bookstore and then to an ice cream shop, and your children could walk to school, probably unescorted. (It sounds like so many movie depictions of America in the 1950s.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They argue that walkability lowers crime -- that good people on the streets drive away the bad guys -- and that it generally improves life and sharply raises home values. Whether it helps homes retain their value when the market slumps, however, seems a harder question to answer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A study published in August by C.E.O.'s for Cities, a group of urban redevelopment advocates, found that in many ways, the street corner beats the cul de sac. It looked at the sales of 90,000 homes in 15 markets to estimate how much value was associated with something called the Walk Score. Using a 100-point scale, this score rates the number of destinations, including libraries, parks and coffee shops, within walking distance of a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scores for America's 40 largest cities can be found at Walkscore.com by typing in an address. For instance, the White House scores a near-perfect 97: a ''walker's paradise,'' the Web site says. Another famous home, the Playboy mansion in Los Angeles, rates a 25. (You can get lost in Walkscore.com for hours; the ''Brady Bunch'' house, the exemplar of 1970s suburban life, scores an above-average 75.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study found that houses with above-average Walk Scores commanded a premium. It was as much as $30,000 in cities like Charlotte, N.C., Chicago, Sacramento and San Francisco, wrote Joe Cortright, the study's author and an economist at Impresa, a consulting firm in Portland, Ore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The correlation failed to hold in 2 of the 15 cities studied -- Bakersfield, Calif., and Las Vegas, where housing prices decreased in walkable neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, there is no definitive study concluding that the more walkable neighborhoods hold their value better when the real estate market declines. But Mr. Cortright wrote in a study done a year earlier for the same group that the spike in gasoline prices in 2005 popped the housing bubble. He found that distant suburbs had the largest declines in home values, while prices in ''close in'' neighborhoods, typically those that were the most walkable, held up or, in a few cases, increased.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He cited an example in the Chicago area where a suburban home worth the same as a close-in home in 2006 had declined in price, relative to the city home, by $66,000 in 12 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More definitive answers may be found in the mountain of data accumulated by new online companies involved in real estate. Academics who once had to choose between stale government data or aggregated sales information from the National Association of Realtors can now sift through detailed neighborhood information almost as soon as a ''Sold'' sign goes up on the lawn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Impresa study used data from Zip, an online real estate listing service. Zillow.com, a Web site that tracks home values, is amassing considerable data useful for consumers and researchers alike. For example, it tracks home values by ZIP codes and in some cities -- like Seattle, where Zillow is based -- by well-defined neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Google</span>, whose search query data has been used to track trends and even flu epidemics, is also starting to accumulate real estate sales data. Academics haven't yet published definitive studies using these new sources of information. But Stan Humphries, Zillow's chief economist, recently used the firm's data to show that, in most cities, low-end homes fell in value far more than those on the high end. He also found that high-end homes had fallen prey to foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. HUMPHRIES is also looking for other trends to tease out of the data, taking a stab, for example, at examining how home prices are related to proximity. He can personally relate to this. He lives in Sammamish, an eastern suburb of Seattle with a Walk Score of 29, where average home values are down 21 percent from their peak in 2007. Prices fell 14 percent in the centrally located Green Lake neighborhood of Seattle, with a score of about 89 -- a decline comparable to that of other more urban neighborhoods of the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using Zillow data, he looked at concentric circles of major metropolitan areas and, with some exceptions, it held true that property values closer to the city center held up. One anomaly is Detroit, where neighborhoods near the city center have been devastated by population loss, which in turn has bred fires, vandalism and crime.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the lesson of buying close-in, he said, is becoming pretty clear: ''If you are a rational actor trying to maximize your dollar, you may have to pay more.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">INVESTORS thinking of putting fresh money into real estate investment trusts might easily be dissuaded by unremitting news of distressed commercial property -- and predictions that the situation will become even worse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's more, REIT shares have already doubled from their low point in March, handily outpacing the 65 percent rebound of the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span> 500-stock index through the end of last year. That suggests that REITs are no longer bargains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We went from a near-death experience to a shocking investment recovery,'' said Mike Kirby, chairman and research director of Green Street Advisors, a REIT specialist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all of 2009, mutual funds that invest in American real estate, a category that includes REIT funds, gained 30.35 percent, after a 39.7 percent battering in 2008, according to Lipper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the stocks' recovery and the persistently grim headlines of default and bankruptcy, careful investors may still find opportunities if they are seeking diversified exposure to real estate -- and without having to worry about tenants with wee-hours plumbing crises.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Yields are still handsome, and there is room for continued growth,'' said Tom Roseen, a senior research manager for Lipper. ''People are able to get into these funds'' at prices still little changed from 2003, the middle of seven consecutive years of positive performance, the longest stretch for any sizable asset class.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kirby said that while the shares were no longer in the bargain bin, ''our thinking is that REITs should be part of every portfolio -- always.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apart from paying dividends that average a tad under 4 percent -- not nearly as juicy as they were last spring but still twice that of the S.&amp;P. 500 -- many publicly traded REITs are planning to scoop up distressed properties that banks and other lenders are expected to toss onto the market. (Publicly traded REITs hold 10 percent of the nation's commercial real estate.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the likely sellers are many private REITs and other investors that bought at the height of the market in mid-decade with huge amounts of borrowed money -- great waves of which will be due for repayment and will not be able to be refinanced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many sellers will be sacrificing certain property to hold on to other parts of their portfolios, said Brad Case, research vice president for the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, the industry trade group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As banks' fortunes improve with economic recovery, regulators are thought to be less likely to let them keep benefiting from a practice of ''pretend and extend,'' under which they have deferred recognition of obvious real estate losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As concern about systemic risk diminishes, they'll have to sell distressed property,'' Mr. Case said. ''It'll get started in 2010 but it really won't peak until 2012.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, several new REITs, so-called blind pools because they currently own no property, might be able to take advantage of the situation by buying. One of them, <span class="companylink">Pebblebrook Hotel Trust</span>, raised $350 million in an initial public offering last month and now sells at a premium (8.75 percent on Wednesday).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hotels, lacking long-term leases, are considered one of the riskiest types of REIT, followed by those invested mainly or heavily in office buildings and shopping centers. In June, for example, Sunstone Hotel Investors, which bought the W San Diego Hotel in 2006, turned it over to lenders when it could not make a mortgage payment. Apartment REITs and self-storage REITs are among the least risky, though the self-storage variety has recently performed poorly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jason Luker, a principal at Cardinal Group Investments, said that while he finds prices of many older REITs with soured so-called legacy assets ''a little frothy right now,'' certain new REITs could be rewarding. ''Some of these I.P.O.'s are going to be very attractive,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of his favorite established REITs is <span class="companylink">Essex Property Trust</span>, which owns and operates apartment houses on the West Coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financing fire-sale merchandise should be relatively easy, analysts say, because REITs have been raising huge amounts of equity capital since the liquidity crisis lifted early in 2009, minimizing default risk, and the markets reopened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REITs are highly sensitive to capital market conditions, which remain very difficult for many borrowers, because REITs must pay at least 90 percent of earnings as dividends to shareholders to keep from being taxed themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kirby of Green Street agrees that many REITs, especially private ones, are overleveraged and will be hard-pressed to refinance some $1.5 trillion of mortgage debt coming due over the next four years. But while he considers the market ''on the pricey side of a fair range,'' he shuns pessimism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a lot of press about how the fundamentals are horrible,'' he said, acknowledging that cash flows will decline for another year or so. ''It's ugly. But we all know it's ugly -- so now let's price it,'' he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although investors can directly buy shares of REITs, which are hands-on managers of the properties they own, mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that buy REIT shares generally provide more diversification and less risk. Public REITs and funds are also highly transparent because property holdings are typically individually disclosed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are some 400 classes of REIT fund shares, including ones sponsored by Fidelity, Vanguard, Cohen &amp;Steers, ING, John Hancock and <span class="companylink">Barclays</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vanguard's entry, the REIT Index fund, is managed passively to mimic the entire market, a generally sound strategy but one that also means there is no manager trying to produce stellar results in a market that may be inefficiently analyzed and priced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A savvy active manager can make a difference,'' said Mr. Roseen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taxes on REIT earnings and gains can be a bit complicated, and many specialists suggest holding them in I.R.A.'s or other tax-deferred accounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Be very selective,'' advised Scott L. Robinson, professor of real estate capital markets at New York University, who is a particular admirer of the retail-oriented <span class="companylink">Simon Property Group</span>, the nation's largest public real estate company, and who finds REIT shares generally ''fairly priced'' these days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Insist on solid balance sheets and dividend coverage, make sure that portfolio companies have access to capital and, especially, ''look for management teams that have been around for a few recessions,'' he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TWO years ago, unemployment was around 5 percent, the average price paid for an apartment in Manhattan was nearing $1.7 million, and Eliot Spitzer had a good shot at becoming president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For a while there, we had to tell people that if they wanted to buy a $1 million condo, they were looking at a one-bedroom,'' said Pamela Liebman, the president of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, things look a bit different.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, $1 million will buy much more space -- even a three-bedroom apartment fine for raising a few children in the city. That price change can mean the difference between choosing to stay in the city and deciding to move to the suburbs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, you can still easily spend $3 million or $4 million on a three-bedroom in a doorman building on Park Avenue, and a ceiling of $1 million won't get you a Classic 6 on the Upper West Side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But far more agreeably priced three-bedrooms are out there. And while they tend to be on the small side, the compromises they demand are not deal-breakers -- no mountain of stairs to climb, for instance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is, for example, a three-bedroom apartment for sale for $950,000 on the 15th floor of a doorman building at 444 East 75th Street and York Avenue. The apartment, 15DE -- a combination of two units, a studio and a two-bedroom -- is about 1,440 square feet, with lots of closet space, a small office and views of the East River.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building does have drawbacks. Buses stop nearby, but it's a hike from the subway, and the maintenance is high, almost $3,000 a month. So the broker, Debra Hoffman-Brill, a vice president of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, says she priced the apartment accordingly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have great affection for the building,'' said the seller, Bill Nolan, who served on the board for many years. ''It's just time for me to go.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately for Mr. Nolan, this is an especially bad time to be selling a three-bedroom apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel, the median price paid for a three-bedroom in Manhattan fell 42.0 percent, from $4.05 million the fourth quarter of 2008 to $2.35 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. In that same period, two-bedrooms fell 23.3 percent, one-bedrooms 7.6 percent, and studios 10.7 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that big drop in the price of three-bedrooms does not mean that demand for them has dried up. It indicates that fewer large, pricey apartments -- the kinds of places that push average prices up -- have sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average size of the three-bedrooms that closed in the fourth quarter of 2008 in Manhattan was about 2,650 square feet. A year later, it was about 2,100 square feet. That's a 21 percent drop in size, which accounts for half the drop in price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These three-bedrooms are somewhere between the size of an average two- and an average three-bedroom,'' Mr. Miller said of the apartments selling today. ''There's more living space devoted to bedrooms than to a living room or a dining room.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financing is one reason small three-bedroom apartments move faster than larger ones. Getting a mortgage is still difficult, especially when it comes to nonconforming, or ''jumbo'' mortgages, which in Manhattan is anything over $729,750.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People are looking to trade up from a one- or a two-bedroom and still qualify for a mortgage,'' Mr. Miller said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers are advising sellers to price their apartments below $1 million to make it easier for buyers to secure financing, and also so that buyers can avoid the 1 percent mansion tax that kicks in at that threshold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 112 West 72nd Street, Apartment 7BC, a three-bedroom, was originally priced at $1.1 million, which would have required the buyer to pay a mansion tax of about $11,000. But after six weeks, the sellers dropped the price to $995,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People get really caught up psychologically over this 1 percent tax,'' said Jessica Cohen, an executive vice president of Prudential Douglas Elliman, and the lead broker on the apartment. ''We wanted to open up the buyer pool to get a qualified buyer more quickly.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Apartment 7BC is a combination of a small two-bedroom and a studio, so the living spaces are meager -- the apartment measures only about 1,000 square feet. It also needs to be renovated. Still, it is in a prewar building on the Upper West Side with excellent subway access. The common charge is $689 and the real estate taxes are $712.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you don't mind living a bit farther from the subway, you might be able to get some of that space back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A three-bedroom apartment at 568 Grand Street, on the Lower East Side, is on the market through Halstead Property for $899,000. On the seventh floor, it has about 1,600 square feet, two bathrooms and a balcony.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This apartment is one of about 1,700 units in the East River Housing Corporation co-op, a four-building complex built in the 1950s by the International Ladies Garment Workers Union.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you're willing to be a 10- to 15-minute walk from the train,'' said Jeremy Bolger, a vice president of Halstead Property, ''it's pretty much the best value you're going to get for your dollar -- in lower Manhattan, at least.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or you can look uptown. At 370 West 118th Street in Harlem, a three-bedroom is listed at $770,000. In a prewar building, the condo has two bathrooms, a washer dryer and Morningside Park views. At about 1,100 square feet, it has a common charge of $591.73 a month, and a tax abatement until 2034.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You're under $600 a month'' in common charges, said Goldine Eismann, an agent at Halstead Property, the exclusive agent on the property. ''Once people can come up with the financing, then they won't have all this extra burden besides their mortgage.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three-bedroom apartments for less than $1 million may also be had in sought-after parts of Brooklyn --even some for less than $750,000. A small three-bedroom at 656 Baltic Street, on the edge of Park Slope, for example, is listed at $725,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment was put up for sale in May, at $799,000. But sales in the building have been slow going, in part because 656 Baltic, 1980s construction, was empty, having been completely remodeled by a developer. Most banks won't lend to potential buyers in a building until a certain percentage of the project is sold -- sometimes as much as 70 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building on Baltic has three apartments, and two are now in contract. The remaining unit, a three-bedroom with a balcony, is just under 1,100 square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The broker, Teri Cavanaugh of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, says banks have told her that financing should be available. ''Because it's a three-unit building, it was difficult for a while to get that first person to sign a contract,'' Ms. Cavanaugh said. ''It's just been a trying year.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''And now,'' she added, ''we've finally got traction.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THERE are over 100,000 iPhone apps available on iTunes. Some help you find a restaurant, others let you find Waldo. There is also a growing selection of real estate apps that will help you look for a home, but not all of them are designed for the New York City market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A search of iTunes -- by no means comprehensive -- turned up several new or updated apps that have something to offer New Yorkers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apps share many basic features, like using the phone's GPS navigation to show listings nearby and narrowing the field by things like price, number of bedrooms and property type. These programs are also available for the iPod Touch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These programs and the companies that power them all work a little differently. And all of these applications are available free -- because the providers hope to make their money elsewhere. Beyond that, some differences start to emerge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trulia, a Web site that aggregates real estate listings, released an update to its year-and-a-half-old iPhone app last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One new feature, for example, is the price-reduction filter, which allows you to tap into a timely market trend by looking only at apartments that have had a price drop. There is also a ''popular homes'' search, which brings up the listings that have received the most Trulia hits. This application does not carry advertising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Trulia, and many other companies venturing into iPhone territory, the purpose of an app is to create buzz and awareness of its brand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is no direct revenue associated with our mobile right now at all,'' said Ken Shuman, a Trulia spokesman. ''If you're not in mobile now, you'll be lost.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">The Corcoran Group</span>, a real estate brokerage based in Manhattan, started its free iPhone app in December. Unlike some of its competitors, Corcoran hopes the app will help sell real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're simply giving people a new way to search,'' said Christina Lowris-Panos, Corcoran's executive vice president for marketing and advertising. ''It's definitely more of a search tool rather than a lark to generate advertising and buzz for the brand.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The application, which lists homes for sale or for rent, is intended for three markets: New York City, Long Island and South Florida. It uses the phone's GPS to orient you in each of the three areas, based on your location.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like other applications, this program can plot your location and filter searches based on criteria like price, size or open houses. But Corcoran, which has a vested interest in the properties that consumers see, offers only its own listings rather than a larger aggregated pool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main feature that distinguishes this application from others is the ''Get Out Nearby'' feature, which suggests restaurants and shopping in the vicinity, powered by BlackBook guides.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nytimes.com is also releasing a new, free iPhone app, which is expected to be available on iTunes next month. It will have standard search functions for rental and for sale listings and an option to search for listings on which prices have been reduced. It will also allow you to filter for apartments offered for sale by owner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once you select a listing, you will be able to create a file within the app to add your own pictures and notes. (If you went to an open house for an apartment billed as ''large and full of light'' and found that it was a room in a basement, you could write ''saw it; hated it,'' as a reminder.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's a pretty unique feature for the real estate space,'' said Ira Silberstein, a vice president of product development for Nytimes.com. ''But the primary capability of the app is that people will really be able to do a robust search on the application while they're mobile.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The app will be able to be synched automatically with your nytimes.com profile and will display real estate articles from The New York Times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recently updated Blue Atlas Broker application offers apartments for sale and for rent. But it has another category as well: foreclosures. This allows you to search for distressed homes just as you would for a co-op or condominium.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This app, which offers national and international listings pulled from <span class="companylink">Google</span>'s Real Estate database, has the usual filters and map features, but you can also search open houses more narrowly -- today, tomorrow or next week. (The open house search on most apps brings up listings without regard to when the open houses are scheduled, whether it's tomorrow or next Sunday.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another thing that sets this application apart is its purpose: to make money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blue Atlas is a small technology company that started up in 2008 in Cape Cod, Mass. Its business is not real estate but iPhone apps. ''The goal is to provide service to customers,'' said Anthony Amundson, the founder of Blue Atlas Technology. ''We hope they find it valuable and buy it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The app is available free for a version that includes advertisements, or you can upgrade to one without ads for 99 cents. The real estate program was Blue Atlas's first. Mr. Amundson says the company hopes to release its second app soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The StreetEasy Web site has an iPhone app that been available for 16 months, and it also has listings for sale and rent. A newer version was released last week that allows you to sign up for updates on buildings -- if a unit sells or a new listing hits the market, you'll get an e-mail message.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It generates traffic to the Web site,'' Sofia Song, the vice president for research at StreetEasy, said of the app, ''but really its just an added bonus for our uses.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Warburg Realty, a New York City brokerage, has taken a different approach to the iPhone. Warburg has signed onto the ''Around Me'' application, which tells you what's in your area, in categories ranging from coffee shops to hospitals to banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When you select a category, a small ''Warburg'' tag appears at the top of each list of local establishments -- the tag appears only if you're in New York City. If you tap it, you'll be taken to a list of nearby Warburg properties, which you can select to put on a map.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Warburg's application does not allow you to search for homes outside your immediate vicinity or browse all of the company's listings. But Frederick W. Peters, the president of Warburg, says that the app was not designed to show you every available apartment. It is about advertising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When you do something like this you're doing it absolutely as much for brand recognition as you are because you think you're necessarily going to sell a lot of property,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Peters said the partnership with ''Around Me'' was his company's initiative, and the app did require an investment on their part. But, he said, it was one he was happy to make.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People almost never buy the apartment you advertise,'' Mr. Peters added. ''The goal of marketing in the real estate business is to have people remember you so they will contact you when they're ready to buy real estate.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IF you're contemplating buying a home in Douglas Manor, a peninsula on Little Neck Bay in northeast Queens, be advised: your neighbors may not think of your house as yours right away. On paper it belongs to you, but in their minds it may take years until you truly succeed its old owners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We get that all the time,'' said Robert Cangemi, a lighting designer who moved to Douglas Manor -- a subsection of Douglaston -- with his wife, Sonia, a social worker, in 2007. Elliot G. Sander, the former chief executive of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, used to live in their black-and-white four-bedroom colonial on Warwick Avenue, which they still hear referred to as the Sander house. When it will become the Cangemi house is anybody's guess.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the custom does reflect one important fact about this little-known part of the city: it is a close-knit place, bound by water on three sides, and with an active neighborhood association that each homeowner joins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has been this way since 1906, when the Rickert-Finlay Realty Company bought land from George Douglas, a Scottish ship builder, for a community north of the Douglaston station on what is now the <span class="companylink">Long Island Rail Road</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's unbelievable,'' said Lee Fiorino, who serves on the local historical association's visioning committee. ''We moved here to be anonymous,'' she said of herself and her husband, Don, ''but the ironic thing is, we're very involved.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The family-heavy area of roughly 2,000 is home to young couples like the Cangemis, who are in their 30s, as well as empty nesters looking to downsize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is also becoming more ethnically diverse -- having morphed from the kind of place where ''some people wouldn't deign to consider playing tennis with an Italian,'' said Al Kelly, a former president of the Douglas Manor Association. Census data for the ZIP code that includes Douglas Manor, and also parts of Douglaston and Little Neck, indicate an area 73.4 percent white, 21.6 percent Asian, 7.7 percent Hispanic or Latino and 0.4 percent black.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there's the expanding population of returnees. ''I came back here to raise my kids, and that happens all the time,'' said Jamie Sutherland, the secretary of the association. ''People come back here and play musical houses.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One thing that the Manor Association says people can't do, at least without approval from the Landmarks Preservation Commission, is exterior renovation: the area is a city historic district.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taking bike trips to the Manor from Fresh Meadows, his childhood home, Mr. Cangemi recalled, he always aspired to live there. More recently, he bided his time in a rental and then a co-op just south, taking walks with his future wife among its houses and cobblestone curbs, making believe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We'd see this house that was falling apart, and we would say, 'Would you take that one to live here?' '' he said. ''And we'd say, 'Of course,' because the neighborhood was so special.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple got their chance in 2007, when they sold their co-op and bought the house on Warwick Avenue for just over $1 million. They added their own touches -- a new driveway and landscaping, two redone bathrooms, an approved bit of color within the black-and-white scheme -- and it finally began to feel like their own. They've made friends, taking boat rides on Little Neck Bay and thinking about filling the house's four bedrooms with children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only issue they've had thus far, Mr. Cangemi said, is that no one he meets in other parts of the city knows where Douglas Manor is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT YOU'LL FIND</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is just one type of housing stock, and it's the standalone single-family. In fact, the Manor Association, which collects $500 a year in dues from each homeowner, allows nothing else, declaring that ''no building of the character known as a 'two-family house' or 'flat' shall be erected.'' (Other old-time restrictions seem less onerous these days, like the rule that houses can't cost less than $5,000 to build.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 600 or so houses in the neighborhood, which is 188 acres in area, offer an impressive stylistic diversity: from ranches to colonials; from McKim, Mead &amp;White to Sears &amp;Roebuck. And, said Kevin Wolfe, an architect who co-founded the Douglaston/Little Neck Historical Society, ''there are probably more Arts and Craft-style houses here than in any area of New York City.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along Shore Road, snaking up the peninsula's western flank, sit some grand houses. Larger lots (hence, houses) tend to be on the west side, smaller lots and homes to the east.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The reason for that was they wanted to attract all different people of different socioeconomic levels,'' said Arlene Angelilli, a 33-year resident who is on her third home in the Manor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The waterfront is owned and maintained by the Douglas Manor Association for its members. In warmer weather, people amble up and down Shore Road in the car lanes as autos play second fiddle, Mr. Wolfe said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The peninsula's east side is marked by Marinette Street and Douglas Road, where the feel is more secluded, with views not of the open bay but of woods and wetlands. A private waterside park called Memorial Field is there, with playing fields and basketball courts. Nearby, houses toward the peninsula's southern end rest on a large hill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Douglas Manor has no sewers. Instead, each house has a cesspool, which its owners must maintain in accordance with Environmental Protection Agency regulations. Families hire a service to haul away waste; it costs about $150 and is needed every one or two years for a properly functioning system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just south of Cherry Street, the Manor's border, is a small commercial area on 235th Street, on either side of the <span class="companylink">Long Island Rail Road</span> stop. There are a few restaurants and other businesses -- though an effort is afoot to revitalize the strip. (Just last month, New York state approved the creation of a chamber of commerce for the area.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT YOU'LL PAY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are never very many houses for sale at any given time. Current inventory is 10. But those who have looked before may be pleasantly surprised by today's values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They have continued to sell, but at a lower price,'' said Rod O'Connell, who owns Bryce Rea Associates Real Estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In general, prices are down about 10 percent from a year and a half ago, said Peter Orisses, a Douglas Manor resident who is also a broker at United Realty Associates in Bayside.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smaller houses sell in the $800,000-to-$900,000 range, Mr. Orisses said, explaining that larger houses start around $1.2 million. The biggest sale ever, in 2007, was $5.3 million, for a very large brick house on Shore Road. Last July, Mr. O'Connell sold a six-bedroom, 5,000-square-foot Tudor on Hollywood Avenue for $1.725 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On average, he says, houses are on the market about three months, whereas it used to be anywhere from one day to one month. ''The chaos is out of it, which was awful,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE COMMUTE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From Douglaston station, travel time to Pennsylvania Station is 25 to 30 minutes; the station is on 235th Street. A one-way peak hour ticket costs $8.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT TO DO</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many residents belong to the Douglaston Club, which is housed in a grand 1819 mansion on West Drive that in the 19th century was home to the merchant and city alderman Wynant Van Zandt. The club has a pool, tennis courts and a yacht fleet that utilizes the pier off Beverly Road. Over the summer, children 7 and up can take part in the Junior Sailing Program, competing in regattas all over the region. There are also waterfront concerts. In the fall, there is an aquathlon (swimmingand running) called the Splash and Dash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE SCHOOLS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Douglas Manor falls within the city school system's 26th District, which is highly regarded by parents. The closest elementary is Public School 98, or the Douglaston School, on 235th Street. In 2009, 95.5 percent of third-, fourth- and fifth-graders met standards in English, 100 percent in math.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Junior High School 67, the Louis Pasteur School, is south of the neighborhood on Marathon Parkway. In 2009, 98.4 percent of its students met standards in math, 95.4 percent in English.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One nearby high school is Benjamin N. Cardozo on 223rd Street in Bayside. In 2009, SAT averages were 546 in math, 484 in reading and 493 in writing, versus 500, 480 and 470 statewide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE HISTORY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Douglas family's land, like other parts of Long Island, was originally occupied by Native Americans of the Matinecock tribe. Dutch settlers like the Van Wyck and Van Zandt families eventually arrived; the Douglases bought the land after Mr. Van Zandt died. According to Mr. Wolfe, the historian and architect, the Rickert-Finlay company developed the area about the time that the commuter railroad connecting directly with Manhattan. By giving residents universal access to the waterfront, Rickert-Finlay was able to sell less desirable lots for more than they would otherwise have been worth.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SO is it over? The three-year period of unrelenting home price declines: has it stopped? And is it possible that sales prices will go the other way in 2010?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Excited by brisk business in some locales even during the traditionally slow holidays, a few real estate brokers began blurting out such hopes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think the change in direction is starting to happen,'' said Ken Baris, the president of Jordan Baris Realty, after selling a West Orange colonial, a Livingston split-level and a Newark condominium -- all for full price, or nearly -- during the week between Christmas and New Year's Day. He quickly added a caveat: ''Maybe values will drop again before they go up.'' But then came an addendum to that: ''I feel confident they will rise.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Statistically speaking, there are grounds for modest optimism that prices will trend upward in the near future, said the market analyst Jeffrey Otteau, whose Otteau Valuation Group continuously tracks sales data in 21 counties for real estate companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Otteau cited one recent report indicating that New Jersey was one of a half dozen ''breakout'' states in which prices had already begun to creep up in the second half of 2009. That report came from the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span>, which indexes purchase prices of homes with mortgages guaranteed by <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> and <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking at data from the entire period of the slide -- the start of 2006 through the third quarter of 2009 -- Mr. Otteau concluded that the state's residential market ''didn't get hammered all that bad'' compared with the nation at large, and was likely to recover faster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, the parts of the state that suffered the least decline in prices are the ones most likely to bounce back the fastest, Mr. Otteau said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median home price declined 12.4 percent statewide over the three years, to $289,275 from $330,331, by the Otteau Group calculations. Two northwestern New Jersey counties, Sussex and Hunterdon, got hit much harder than the average, both experiencing declines of more than 20 percent, which various analysts have ascribed to sparser development, smaller population and greater distance from job centers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back when home prices were at their highest, buyers had started to ''push west'' to those counties, trading longer commutes for affordability, said James Bednar, who writes a blog on state real estate at njrereport.com. With the general decline in prices during the past few years, ''demand to move to those western counties has dropped,'' said Mr. Bednar, whose online self-description is ''Grim.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Hudson County, by contrast, median purchase prices fell just 2.6 percent, peak to trough. The pace of sales pace slowed sharply over the three-year period, even as thousands of new, high-end condominiums came on the market. But Hudson's proximity to Manhattan jobs bolstered values, as it has for the 30 years, since waterfront area redevelopment began west of the river.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Essex, Somerset, Mercer, Camden, Atlantic and Salem counties, prices declined 5 to 10 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Bergen, Union, Monmouth and Gloucester counties, the decline was 10 to 15 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides Sussex and Hunterdon, the hardest-hit counties -- with declines between 15 and 20 percent -- were Passaic, Morris and Warren, in the northern part of the state; Ocean and Burlington in central Jersey; and Cape May at the southern tip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Every county has its own story,'' said Mr. Otteau, noting that Cape May is heavy with resort properties and second homes, which do not sell well during a recession, and that intense redevelopment efforts in the more urbanized areas of Essex and Camden counties probably helped minimize price declines there</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several brokers said they did not even think of real estate markets in terms of county lines. Perri K. Feldman, an agent with <span class="companylink">Keller Williams Realty</span>, sees her primary turf as being towns running along the Midtown Direct Train line from Morristown to South Orange (Morris to Essex County).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices rose in that area late in 2009, Mrs. Feldman said; she originally saw a rush to meet the Nov. 30 deadline to ensure eligibility for a federal income tax credit. That federal stimulus program has since been extended; now buyers have until April 30 to enter into a contract for a new primary residence and June 30 to close on the home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cumberland County actually saw its median sales price rise during the market slump years, but Mr. Otteau called that an anomaly, ''based on its comparatively small population and the county being comparatively un-built-up, so any development at all that occurred skewed the figures.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cumberland, at the southern end of New Jersey just above the Delaware Bay, has the lowest median sales price of any county; it rose to $172,000 by the end of 2009, from $165,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In general, Mr. Bednar said, ''it's that lower end that is taking the biggest hit.'' On the other hand, it is his view that those same lower-priced areas saw ''the biggest speculation, and biggest run-up'' in prices during the boom years before 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Otteau suggested that it was best not to obsess over home values in the short term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the housing finance agency, he noted, New Jersey's median home price rose nearly 6 percent when measured over a five-year period, 2003 to 2009. Going back all the way to 1991, when the agency started keeping its statistics in their current form, the median home price has risen 129 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you bought in the last five years and need to sell your house today,'' Mr. Otteau said, ''then the short-term cycle is relevant. But only about 1 out of 10 homeowners are in that situation. For the rest of us, it doesn't really matter what home prices are doing right now.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. White, 45, is the founder and president of <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>, a Manhattan-based market research company that tracks commercial real estate sales and trends globally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before starting R.C.A., in 2001, Mr. White spent 14 years working in real estate investment banking and as a broker, at Granite Partners, now called Savills, and at Eastdil Realty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. What prompted you to start the company?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. My friends on the Street --whether they are in M &amp;A or municipal bonds -- could always say, ''In my industry the volume last week was X-hundred billion.'' Down to the penny. Nobody knew how many office buildings were traded in any given year or how big the volume was in this marketplace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I started collecting information and publishing quarterly reports for clients, and as we traveled around pitching business, I could see their eyes light up when they saw this marketplace quantified. A lot of the standard metrics that Wall Street uses to analyze financial markets were applicable, and I thought, hmm ... there's something there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. What is R.C.A.'s main focus?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We focus exclusively on the capital side -- the sales. We have 108 countries where we're tracking deals right now. We have data partnerships and researchers, and throughout the staff we have 17, 18 language capabilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Let's get right to the numbers for the New York market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. In 2009, the investment market came to a near-standstill in Manhattan. For all property types, 2009 will be below $7 billion in terms of sales in the New York City metropolitan area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That compares with $77 billion in 2007, so we're at 10 percent of volume from two years ago. It's also a big drop-off from 2008, which wasn't a good year, either; in 2008, we had $26 billion in sales, which still earned us the No. 2 spot globally, behind Tokyo. When you think of it, $7 billion in deals is nothing -- it's not much more than the price for Stuyvesant Town.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Office sales are about $2.7 billion. In 2008, it was $15 billion, and at the peak, in 2007, it was $50 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. How many transactions?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. For office properties $5 million or greater in Manhattan, there were 23. In 2007, there were 188; and in 2008, 84.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. And for all property types?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. It's 86 transactions. In 2008, 250 transactions; and then the peak in 2007, it was 488 transactions, including some buildings that were traded twice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. What was the biggest deal?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. The biggest, and probably the most symbolic deal, was Worldwide Plaza. It was one of the last of the famous Macklowe Properties assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Where does New York rank globally right now?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. The bad news is Manhattan has been knocked off the perennial perch as the No. 1 market. It's not even in the top 10 of all property types -- it's down to No. 13. In the office sector, New York fell to No. 8.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Which cities precede it?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Let's just talk office: there's London, Tokyo, Paris, Seoul, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Moscow. Even Moscow had more office sales than New York!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Do you find any of those markets of particular interest?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I'm watching very closely the pricing of office buildings in London, because that city is a very good template for where Manhattan is headed next. Manhattan and London have the world's largest financial, economic and cultural centers, so capital from all over the globe wants to be invested in real estate in usually one of those two markets. London started its downward descent maybe a year before New York, but in the past six months, and especially in the past 90 days, activity has exploded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Is there a similar rebound on the horizon in New York?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. A key factor in the turnaround in Europe has been foreign investors. They are responsible for about 80 percent of the deals in London over the past six months. And much of that money would like to be in New York. As cap rates fall in London and prices rise again, New York starts looking more attractive on a relative pricing basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Do you own real estate?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I own a brownstone on the Upper West Side. I bought it 15 years ago for $475,000, and used a second mortgage on it to start the company. Now I'm trying to decide: Should I renovate this place to a single-family, which could get the big bucks, or maybe hedge the bet and do a duplex?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A graphic in some editions on Friday with the continuation of an article about the slumping commercial real estate market in New York, using information from real estate experts, referred imprecisely to 400 Madison Avenue. Although it has been identified as a property with financial problems, the owners are up to date on their loan payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Thu Jan 14 2010</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are 920 football fields of available office space in Manhattan. More than 180 major buildings totaling $12.5 billion in value -- from Columbus Tower at 1775 Broadway to the office tower 400 Madison Avenue -- are in trouble, meaning in many cases they face foreclosure or bankruptcy, or have had problems making mortgage payments. Rents for commercial office space fell faster over the past two years than in any such period in the last half century.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have been in the business for 12 years. I have never seen it this bad,'' Peter Von Der Ahe, vice president of investments for the brokerage Marcus &amp;Millichap, said of New York City's commercial real estate market. According to more veteran colleagues, he said, things have not been so dire since at least the early 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that is not the most sobering assessment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It hasn't hit bottom,'' Mr. Von Der Ahe added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is not alone. More than half a dozen experts on commercial real estate in New York City said that despite some flickering signs of economic recovery here and elsewhere in the country, the universe of big buildings and giant apartment complexes has further to tumble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rents, they say, will go lower. Vacancy rates are likely to rise, too. Owners of troubled properties will face a final day of reckoning and in some cases lose their properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're projecting the biggest value losses in the nation,'' said Aaron Jodka, a senior real estate economist at Property and Portfolio Research, a Boston-based independent real estate research and advisory firm. He predicts that by 2011, the value of New York metropolitan area office buildings will decline by 58 percent from its late 2007 peak. It is already down 40 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some experts point to the bright sides of a down market -- for example, the opportunity to snap up some great bargains. They say that investors who already have been shopping in London for skyscraper deals may set their sights on Manhattan later this year to find deals, and that may fuel some growth in overall sales. Some New Yorkers, especially businesses who have found the market too costly, also may find some deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A correction might give opportunities,'' said Jonathan Bowles, director of the Center for an Urban Future, an independent research group. ''I think it's healthy for the city's real estate market to have a down cycle.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But most members of the real estate industry are lockstep in their pessimism, and the reasons are multiple: Jobs must recover first to fill offices with workers, and job growth in New York City has been all but invisible. Many buildings are also tied up in complex financial arrangements that could take years to unravel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Bach, chief economist at the real estate brokerage <span class="companylink">Grubb &amp;Ellis</span>, compares recovery of the commercial market -- which includes everything from office towers to rental apartment buildings to retail space -- to turning a big ship around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taxes on commercial buildings also make up a sizable share of the revenue base for the city. Residential and commercial development generated $307.7 million in tax revenues, not including property taxes, from 2000 to 2007, according to the Real Estate Board of New York. In fact, the industry had a $12.4 billion effect -- including construction costs like salaries and purchases made by workers -- on the local economy during that period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The tax base is enormous,'' said Michael Slattery, the board's senior vice president of research. ''It helps fund many of the basic services that make our city operate.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard Persichetti, director of New York research for <span class="companylink">Grubb &amp;Ellis</span>, said that when the economy started to slide, office rents fell faster than in any period recorded in at least 50 years. The city has become stuck with more available office space than any other central business district in the nation except Chicago, Washington and Boston. Mr. Persichetti predicts it will take until 2014 to make a major turnaround.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Rents probably won't start to recover until job growth is created and some of that available space is absorbed,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some foreign investors may swoop in this year and buy up some of the city's most desirable and stable skyscrapers, said Robert White, president of the research company <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span> which tracks the city's troubled properties. Then the city will be left with properties in financial difficulties that are half empty and in less coveted locations. Recovery for those buildings, Mr. White said, ''is going to take a little bit longer. It's not going to be in a rush.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No prospective deals on these buildings are apt to be helped by the fact that they are tied up in complicated mortgage structures that grew popular in the boom years. Joseph Harbert, chief operating officer for the New York City region of the commercial brokerage Cushman &amp;Wakefield, says that working out ownership disputes for these buildings will take much longer than in past real estate meltdowns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the '90s, when you had the real estate workouts, you had a lot of single-lender properties. There are more parties and interests in every deal,'' said Mr. Harbert.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regardless of these complications, Mr. Harbert, who remains generally optimistic that parts of the real estate economy could recover this spring, says that lenders, skyscraper buyers and renters will not feel comfortable moving forward until they really see that jobs are being created.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They're kind of waiting for positive signs in the economy,'' he said. ''When jobs are going to recover, that's the signal of when people are going to lease and buy.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article in some editions on Friday about an expected mortgage default by the owners of Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village, sister apartment complexes in Manhattan, misspelled, in some copies, the given name of a longtime tenant at Peter Cooper who said apartment turnover had increased under the current landlords. She is Soni Fink, not Sonni.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Tue Jan 12 2010</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The owners of Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village, the sprawling sister complexes overlooking the East River in Manhattan, will miss a $16 million loan payment on Friday, which would put them in technical default on their mortgages, and the 20,000 residents in limbo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $5.4 billion purchase of the complexes' 110 buildings and 11,227 apartments by Tishman Speyer Properties and BlackRock Realty in 2006 made headlines. But the denouement at Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper has cast a pall over what had been a comfortable harbor for the city's middle class since the complexes opened in the late 1940s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It worries me,'' said Anne Granberry, a nurse who moved into Stuyvesant Town in June. ''They haven't told us anything.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tishman Speyer declined to comment, although executives who had been briefed on the matter said the partners could not pay the entire amount due.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City Councilman Daniel R. Garodnick, who lives in Peter Cooper Village, said Tishman Speyer notified him on Thursday afternoon that it would not make its mortgage payment on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tishman Speyer and its partner have been negotiating since November to restructure $3 billion worth of debt and to hold on to the properties, which cover 80 acres east of First Avenue, from 14th Street to 23rd Street. But their reserves, once stuffed with $890 million for capital improvements, interest payments and renovations, are now virtually depleted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banking and real estate executives say that untangling the financial structure and either foreclosing or devising a new deal will take months. Aside from the $3 billion in mortgages, there is another $1.4 billion in secondary, or mezzanine, loans and almost $1 billion in equity invested by the partners, a Florida pension fund, the Church of England and others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also in the mix are the government-controlled mortgage giants <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, which together hold a bond that is secured by as much as $2 billion of debt on the property. Those two companies will get paid first with whatever revenue comes from the property, but they are not involved in the negotiations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest appraisal puts the value of the complexes at only $1.9 billion, about 65 percent less than the purchase price. So the investors and the debt holders for the mezzanine loans are likely to be left with nothing. The mortgage lenders must apportion the losses and decide whether to sell the properties, or to restructure the loans in the hope that Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper will be worth more at some point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tenants wonder what will happen next.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For so many years, this was the epitome of stability for middle-class New Yorkers,'' said Mr. Garodnick, who has lived there for much of his life. ''Now there are endless questions about its future.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Metropolitan Life built the complexes for World War II veterans in the 1940s, when the city was in desperate need of new housing. It received tax breaks and other incentives in return for maintaining low rents. The buildings became home for generations of workers searching for an affordable spot in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with the real estate market soaring in 2005, <span class="companylink">MetLife</span> decided to sell. Tishman Speyer and BlackRock won an auction the following year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rents collected did not cover the mortgage payments, but like other investors and developers at the time, the partners had a plan to increase net income by steadily renovating and deregulating vacant apartments while raising rents substantially.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For tenant advocates and urban planners, the sale underscored the loss of affordable housing in the city and the highly speculative financial structures that, they warned, would only end in disaster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People used to move in and settle down here,'' said Soni Fink, a tenant since 1961. But, she said, the turnover increased as the new owners began moving single executives and New York University students into expensive apartments. ''Now there are moving vans in the circle all the time. You hardly ever saw moving vans in here unless someone died.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultimately, Tishman Speyer, like many similar buyers, was unable to convert rent-regulated apartments to market-rate rents as quickly as it had anticipated. Rents fell as the recession deepened, and then last fall the state's highest court ruled that the owners had improperly deregulated and raised rents on about 4,400 of the apartments while getting special tax breaks from the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 15-story red-brick buildings are in good shape, tenants say, but they noted that the maintenance and security staffs had been cut. And the owners may owe $200 million in rent overcharges to thousands of tenants as a result of the court ruling.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE house was an ordinary house: It bore him no malice. Alan Berks knows that now. But back in the spring of 2005, when Mr. Berks, a playwright, and his wife bought the three-bedroom home for $214,000, it often seemed that it was trying to ruin his life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alan Berks the renter had spent his evenings with friends at African dance nights and jazz clubs. Alan Berks the homeowner lost an entire day rearranging the living room furniture. ''I did find a spot for the couch that made me happy,'' he said. ''I was proud of myself. But where the couch is -- that's how I'm going to measure my happiness from now on? I remember thinking: 'This is how people live? Why am I doing this?' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were other problems, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I couldn't walk to anything,'' said Mr. Berks, 37, who lived in the Powderhorn Park neighborhood, south of downtown Minneapolis. And routine maintenance distracted him from writing. ''Why would I have any interest in fixing the bathroom sink?'' he said. ''I'm in my 30s. If fixing something made me happy, I would have learned how to do it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Berks's wife, Leah Cooper, 40, a theater director, initially liked the house. But ''I was miserable,'' he said, so she came to dislike it, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the couple's relationship with their home was like a bad love triangle, it was clear which partner needed to go. Eighteen months after moving in, Mr. Berks and his wife took drastic action: They dumped their house (managing to break even), sold almost everything in it, loaded up their Subaru and drove to Honduras for a six-month adventure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Berks said he would not recommend that solution to every homeowner. He and his wife are back in Minneapolis now, in a rental in the Uptown neighborhood, within strolling range of restaurants, bookstores and coffee shops. But looking back, he wonders why so many friends encouraged him to buy a house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I understand why the government or society wants people to have homes,'' he said -- they fix them up, and their commitment stabilizes neighborhoods. ''I get it, the whole beneficial aspect of homeownership. But individually, I'm not seeing it as a moral good.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As it turns out, Mr. Berks is not alone in his disdain. For reasons practical, financial and definitely emotional, there seems to be a growing cohort of men like him who are falling out of love with the holy institution of homeownership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The numbers behind this disenchantment are only suggestive. Men and women under the age of 40 report roughly equal levels of satisfaction with homeownership, according to a large national study by the Center for Community Capital at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Yet the behavior of single men and women hints at divergent gender attitudes toward homeownership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Married couples make up the largest group of new home buyers. Next, according to research from the National Association of Realtors, are single women, who in the last 12 months represented 21 percent of home buyers; single men were just 10 percent. That gap has opened up in the last decade, said Paul Bishop, vice president for research at the association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bishop's survey is silent on the motivation behind the gender split. Younger single men may be more likely to change jobs and cities, he speculates. They may be more willing to squeeze into an apartment with two or three buddies. Or they may be cowering in the nest with Mom and Dad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever the case, a number of men seem to be newly aware of what economists describe as a peculiarity of homeownership: it has an asset value (as an abstract investment) and a consumption value (as a place to watch VH1 and wash underwear).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Once upon a time, people bought houses to live in,'' said William Clark, a geography professor at UCLA, who has written widely about homeownership. That fairy-tale attitude began to change in the 1970s, Mr. Clark said. And in the housing mania of the last decade, he said, many buyers started to see their homes as speculative investments -- high-flying stocks that happened to come with wine cellars and four-car garages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, ''with the sudden run-up in foreclosures, you're starting to see people ask, is housing a good investment?'' he said. ''In fact, it probably never was.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the first time in a generation, homeowners can look at their dwellings without hearing the distracting jingle of the real estate jackpot. And a number of them, having stepped onto the property ladder just as it was becoming shaky, would very much like to get off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Men have no monopoly on domestic discontent. There are also women who wish they had signed their mortgage with disappearing ink. But for men, rejecting homeownership may involve broader questions of manhood, said Dr. Roy Baumeister, a psychology professor at Florida State University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are a lot of extra stresses that men have,'' he said, a claim he advances in a book to be published in the summer, ''Is There Anything Good About Men?'' (Short answer: probably.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In almost every culture, Dr. Baumeister said, ''men are expected to produce'' more than they consume. In a similar fashion, men naturally compete for status. Buying a home, he said, is often tied up with those pressures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For 31-year-old Nathan Quevedo, public information officer for the Merced County Office of Education in California, buying a house with his then-wife marked a conscious arrival in adulthood. But that was before the value of his house in Merced dropped by half in just over two years. And before $500 worth of pool pump filters died -- ending the swimming season for the foreseeable future. And it was definitely before he and his two young daughters took in a roommate to help pay the bills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As his relationship with his 1,800-square-foot tract home has gone bad, Mr. Quevedo said, he has started to question his assumptions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I had some goals that I had set for myself before I turned 30,'' Mr. Quevedo said. ''The first one was to be a homeowner. The second one was to make X amount of money. I accomplished those goals. And they were good goals. I don't fault myself for wanting to have that American dream: a good job, a place to call my own for me and my kids. But I don't think that homeownership is essential for that anymore.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AS a business consultant for start-up ventures, Kirt Greenburg, 41, roams widely from his base in Atlanta. But the frustrations with his 3,300-square-foot colonial revival house, where he lives alone, follow him everywhere. Mr. Greenburg, by his own account, is a ''methodical, list-oriented person,'' and his laptop is full of spreadsheets that document what's wrong with the house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He started his first file in 2002, before he closed on the cedar shake house on a tree-covered acre. The electrical, plumbing and heating systems needed an overhaul; the roof leaked. Mr. Greenburg expected that the repair bill would run $60,000, maybe $70,000. The new Quicken file he clicks open, though, shows he has spent $130,000 (a sum that includes a new kitchen and a complete paint job).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the place still isn't fixed to his satisfaction. He clicks on another spreadsheet that tallies the unfinished repairs, room by room. There are closet floors to patch, sand and finish. There's a basement crawl space to weatherproof. ''There have been a lot of times when I haven't wanted to go home at all,'' Mr. Greenburg said. ''Because home reminds me of all the things I need to get done. It's not an escape for me.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking back, Mr. Greenburg questions why he thought he would want to own such a spacious, high-maintenance home. He grew up with five siblings and enjoyed the noise and hubbub. Yet the home he bought feels silent -- so much so that he sometimes doles out rooms to luckless acquaintances who need a place to crash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His real estate agent described the home as an ideal spot for parties and sit-down dinners. But most of his friends live in condos and apartments across town, where they eat takeout and drop into restaurants, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a kind of entrepreneurial ''nomad'' in the 1990s, Mr. Greenburg bounced among eight cities in one five-year span. Recently, he and his newish boyfriend, a French national who has a short-term job in Atlanta, have daydreamed about starting a new business together -- in the south of France. Owning a house, he said, ''ties me down.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People who are particularly mobile should not be a homeowner because of the high transaction costs'' of unloading a house, said Donald Haurin, an economics professor at Ohio State University, who has studied the civic virtues of homeownership. And younger men, he pointed out, tend to relocate more often than young women do. ''In economic literature, there's certainly nothing that says everyone should be a homeowner.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Greenburg has belatedly come to the same conclusion. ''I was perfectly content to be in a rental, but I thought it didn't make financial sense,'' he said. After a few years of halting gentrification, neighborhood real estate values remain depressed -- and depressing. ''Now that I've sunk in all this money and taken out a mortgage, the main reason it made sense for me is gone,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Mr. Greenburg tethered his fate to a fixer-upper, Hanyul Lee bought a new 4,400-square-foot condo in Medford, just outside Boston. The two-story unit had once been an auditorium, and he and his fiancee customized the vast space while they planned their wedding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sale closed three days after they returned from their honeymoon, in November 2006. Within a week, a wall had cracked and bowed, he said. The ceiling leaked. Before long, rain was pouring in through the windows. There were more travails, Mr. Lee said, but he is suing the developer and said that he would rather not talk about it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though he considers himself financially savvy -- at 29 he is a director at a consulting firm that advises Fortune 500 companies -- he wonders if he might have been too optimistic about buying in a new development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lee's parents gave him a toolbox to celebrate the new digs. Yet the gift only showed him that he didn't know how to make the most basic repairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a humbling experience,'' he said. With his wife taking care of their infant daughter, ''the general expectation is that the man in the household will have competence in fixing things and building things. Whether or not that's warranted, I do not.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adam Ratner said he found fatherhood to be incompatible with homeownership -- he could take care of either his infant daughter or the yard. He picked the one that cooed. Dr. Ratner, a 39-year-old pediatric infectious disease specialist at Columbia University Medical Center, was starting a fellowship in Philadelphia when he bought a house in the Main Line suburb of Narberth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My first day in the house, I managed to lock myself out,'' he said. ''Of course there's no super.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was working ''60 or 70'' hours a week, he said; his wife, Shari Gelber, an obstetrics resident at another hospital, was working ''80 or 90.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultimately, Dr. Ratner admitted, his landscaping neglect went too far. His next-door neighbor, a dentist with an in-home practice, ''got so sick of seeing our grass that he started coming over to mow the lawn,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the yard, Dr. Ratner added, was not a large one. ''I wish I were making this up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2006, with their medical assignments completed, Dr. Ratner and his wife returned to New York and faculty housing in Morningside Heights. ''We ended up chasing a falling market,'' he said of their old house. ''Eventually we just lowered our price enough to sell it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He recollects his old house without bitterness. He misses grilling year-round on his deck, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet his aversion to homeownership may be more powerful than he lets on. When an infestation of bedbugs spread through his apartment building last year, Dr. Ratner and his family had to jettison furniture, carpets and clothing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They did not consider, even for a moment, leaving their rental and buying another house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CHANGING VALUES For Nathan Quevedo, homeownership is no longer a vital part of the American dream.

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Some at Fed See a Need To Do More For Housing</span>
</div><div class="author">By DAVID STREITFELD and JACK HEALY </div><div>742 words</div><div>7 January 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite extensive government intervention in the housing market, some policy makers at the Federal Reserve are worried that even more might need to be done.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee's mid-December meeting, released on Wednesday, reflected a lingering wariness about the strength of the recovery in light of high unemployment and substantial slack in the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, unease is growing that a tentative comeback in the housing market could fall apart as a tax credit for home buyers expires and the Fed's program to hold down mortgage rates comes to a close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Concern over housing deepened Wednesday with the release of new data showing that long-term interest rates were rising rapidly from their historic lows, while mortgage applications to purchase houses were falling. Applications are now at their lowest level in 12 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other signs of stress in real estate have become apparent in the last few weeks, although most economists say any downturn will be relatively mild.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If they are wrong, and the modest pace of economic growth slows or mortgage markets significantly deteriorate, ''a few members'' of the Federal Open Market Committee believe that ''more policy stimulus'' may be desirable, the Fed minutes said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But one member of the panel took an opposite view, saying that the ''quantity of planned asset purchases could be scaled back'' because of continuing improvements in the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Noting the contrast between ''a few'' and ''one,'' Michael Gregory, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, projected a shift in policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There emerged a definite skew towards more accommodation,'' Mr. Gregory wrote in a research note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed has been buying $1.25 trillion of mortgage-backed assets to ease lending markets and keep longer-term rates low -- a program that is winding down and scheduled to end by March 31.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The program was successful for much of last year, pushing mortgage rates below 5 percent, to levels not seen since the early 1950s. Many economists say the end of the program will push rates back up from a half point to a full point, adding to the cost of a house and diminishing the pool of buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Emergency measures to stabilize short-term lending and other markets are also being scaled back and ended as the economy pulls itself out of a deep recession. The tax credit for home buyers, extended once by Congress, is scheduled to end on April 30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, James Bullard, said in late November that the Fed should continue purchasing the securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have advocated to keep the asset-purchase program open but at a very low level, and wait and see what happens,'' Mr. Bullard told Dow Jones Newswires. Mr. Bullard becomes a member of the Federal Open Market Committee this year. That committee is the Fed's main policymaking body.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His view was quickly endorsed by the nation's real estate agents, a potent lobbying force who were successful in getting the first-time buyer's tax credit extended and broadened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The March deadline is artificial and should not hold firm,'' said Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors. ''Maybe we'll need this stimulus until May or autumn.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mortgage Bankers Association said rates rose in the last two weeks of December, to 5.18 percent from 4.92 percent. Meanwhile, applications for purchase mortgages fell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage applications offer an imperfect glimpse into the state of the housing market. If many houses are being bought by speculators with cash -- as is the case now -- that activity is not reflected in the figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The numbers also tend to bounce around from week to week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, the trend is sharply down. Applications are more than 25 percent below their level at the end of 2008, the banking group said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed left its interest rate target unchanged at levels near zero at its meeting, and the minutes indicated that most members believed inflation was not an imminent threat to the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They're very anxious not to torpedo the stabilization we've seen in the housing market, but they don't want inflation expectations to get out of hand,'' said John Canally, an economist at LPL Financial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They're walking a pretty narrow tightrope this year,'' he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If only we'd had more power, we could have kept the financial crisis from getting so bad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has been the position of Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, and other regulators. It explains why Mr. Bernanke and the Obama administration are pushing Congress to give the Fed more authority over financial firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So let's consider what an empowered Fed might have done during the housing bubble, based on the words of the people who were running it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2004, Alan Greenspan, then the chairman, said the rise in home values was ''not enough in our judgment to raise major concerns.'' In 2005, Mr. Bernanke -- then a Bush administration official -- said a housing bubble was ''a pretty unlikely possibility.'' As late as May 2007, he said that Fed officials ''do not expect significant spillovers from the subprime market to the rest of the economy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fact that Mr. Bernanke and other regulators still have not explained why they failed to recognize the last bubble is the weakest link in the Fed's push for more power. It raises the question: Why should Congress, or anyone else, have faith that future Fed officials will recognize the next bubble?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just this week, Mr. Bernanke went to the annual meeting of academic economists in Atlanta to offer his own history of Fed policy during the bubble. Most of his speech, though, was a spirited defense of the Fed's interest rate policy, complete with slides and formulas, like (pt - pt*) &gt; 0. Only in the last few minutes did he discuss lax regulation. The solution, he said, was ''better and smarter'' regulation. He never acknowledged that the Fed simply missed the bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This lack of self-criticism is feeding Congressional hostility toward the Fed. Mr. Bernanke is still likely to win confirmation for a second term, based on his aggressive and creative policies once the crisis began. But Congress hasn't decided whether to expand his regulatory authority and is considering reining in the Fed's other main mission -- setting interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A once-marginal proposal -- from Representative Ron Paul, the Texas Republican -- that would give Congress the power to review interest rate decisions recently passed the House and will soon be considered by the Senate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists are generally horrified by this idea. If Congress could force Fed officials to answer questions about every interest rate move, the process could easily become politicized. A politicized central bank is a first step toward runaway inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But politicizing monetary policy isn't the only mistake Congress could make. It also could end up going in the other direction and handing Fed officials more power without asking them to grapple with their failures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Mr. Bernanke is challenged about the Fed's performance, he often points out that recognizing a bubble is hard. ''It is extraordinarily difficult,'' he said during his Senate confirmation hearing last month, ''to know in real time if an asset price is appropriate or not.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the time, that's true. Do you know if stocks will keep going up? Is gold now in the midst of a bubble? What will happen to your house's value? Questions like these are usually an invitation to hubris.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the recent housing bubble was an exception. By any serious measure, houses in much of this country had become overvalued. From the late 1960s to 2000, the ratio of the median national house price to median income hovered from 2.9 to 3.2. By 2005, it had shot up to 4.5. In some places, buyers were spending twice as much on their monthly mortgage payment as they would have spent renting a similar house, without even considering the down payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than a few people -- economists, journalists, even some Fed officials -- noticed this phenomenon. It wasn't that hard, if you were willing to look at economic fundamentals. You couldn't know exactly when or how far prices would fall, but it seemed clear they were out of control. Indeed, making that call was similar to what the Fed does when it sets interest rates: using concrete data to decide whether some part of the economy is too hot (or too cold).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Fed officials could have had a real impact if they had decided to attack the bubble. Imagine if Mr. Greenspan, then considered an oracle, announced he was cracking down on wishful-thinking mortgages, as he had the authority to do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So why did Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Bernanke get it wrong?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer seems to be more psychological than economic. They got trapped in an echo chamber of conventional wisdom. Real estate agents, home builders, Wall Street executives, many economists and millions of homeowners were all saying that home prices would not drop, and the typically sober-minded officials at the Fed persuaded themselves that it was true. ''We've never had a decline in house prices on a nationwide basis,'' Mr. Bernanke said on CNBC in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and his colleagues fell victim to the same weakness that bedeviled the engineers of the Challenger space shuttle, the planners of the Vietnam and Iraq Wars, and the airline pilots who have made tragic cockpit errors. They didn't adequately question their own assumptions. It's an entirely human mistake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Which is why it is likely to happen again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's missing from the debate over financial re-regulation is a serious discussion of how to reduce the odds that the Fed -- however much authority it has -- will listen to the echo chamber when the next bubble comes along. A simple first step would be for Mr. Bernanke to discuss the Fed's recent failures, in detail. If he doesn't volunteer such an accounting, Congress could request one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the future, a review process like this could become a standard response to a financial crisis. Andrew Lo, an M.I.T. economist, has proposed a financial version of the National Transportation Safety Board -- an independent body to issue a fact-finding report after a crash or a bust. If such a board had existed after the savings and loan crisis, notes Paul Romer, the Stanford economist and expert on economic growth, it might have done some good.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether we like it or not, the Fed really does seem to be the best agency to regulate financial firms. (It now has authority over only some firms.) As the lender of last resort, it already has a vested interest in the health of those firms. The Fed's prestige also tends to give it its pick of people who want to work on economic policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Federal Reserve has unparalleled expertise,'' Mr. Bernanke told Congress last month. ''We have a great group of economists, financial market experts and others who are unique in Washington in their ability to address these issues.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fair enough. At some point, though, it sure would be nice to hear those experts explain how they missed the biggest bubble of our time.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MORENO VALLEY, Calif. -- Phil Winkler pays a neighborhood kid to mow his lawn, that small-bore transaction of the American suburb, where adults are generally busy and teenagers offer a price that's right. But for Mr. Winkler, the relinquishing of his mower was something remarkable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only a few months ago, he was selling auto parts on <span class="companylink">eBay</span> to help pay his bills. Out of work, he depended on his wife and his unemployment checks to keep his family clothed and fed. The situation was much the same in the homes around his: unemployed dads, women on small salaries carrying the weight, home repairs and yard work relegated to adults with too much time to spare.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pockets of America are haltingly on the mend, and the Beth Court cul-de-sac here is one of them. A dozen lives unraveled on the block during the recession; now the empty houses are full, and Mr. Winkler and the other fathers are working again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The remnants of financial disaster linger. Many neighbors have no credit cards. Repossessed family cars have not been replaced. Vacation destinations remain for most the stuff of advertisements in newspapers from which coupons continue to be clipped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But hanging on has been replaced, in part, by holding steady.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The teacher who got a pink slip last spring has been hired by a new school, and the guy on the corner who had struggled for months with the bank over his mortgage finally got a loan modification. The lawn of an empty house, littered with broken bikes and weeds over the summer, has been made pristine once more by its new owners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Things are pretty much better around here,'' said Eladio Soto, a landscaper, who is among the unemployed fathers who has found work again. ''I am thinking about a little minivan. That's my life goal right now.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beginning last January, The New York Times made regular visits to Beth Court, about 60 miles east of downtown Los Angeles, to chronicle how the foreclosure crisis had reshaped a middle-class neighborhood. Four of the eight houses went through foreclosure, and the others barely escaped the same fate. Beth Court was a microcosm of a nation in deep recession, a block of neighbors whose bad choices -- often with the complicity of lending agencies -- came crashing into a global economic downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, a year later, California's unemployment rate continues to grow, its housing market remains depressed and the state's fiscal situation is dire. But the economic and policy shifts that are slowly changing parts of the country are also making a mark here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Winkler, a factory worker, was hired at the end of September by <span class="companylink">Kimberly-Clark</span> at the company's mill in Fullerton, about 50 miles from here. He had gone more than year without a job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commute is long, and so are the hours. When he works the overnight shift, he can go days without seeing his two daughters, who had become accustomed to Mr. Winkler's shuttling them to and from school and taking charge in times of trouble at home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Eva, the 12-year-old, was doing poorly in school, Mr. Winkler literally followed her from class to class for a week. She did not care for it. Good thing for both of them she is on the honor roll now, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm not going to complain,'' Mr. Winkler said the other day at his dining room table. ''It's a lot of work and a lot of hours, but it's more interesting than my old job because I stay so busy. I have insurance for the kids. I'm happy. I'm thankful. And in four months, I'll be getting a raise.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His next-door neighbor, Mr. Soto, has managed to steady his home life after being forced to sell his house to make ends meet. He has reduced his monthly housing costs by about $900 by renting back from the new owner. He misses the large truck, repossessed by his lender, that had ferried his family of seven.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We don't go places as a family anymore,'' Mr. Soto said. ''The other day my daughter's band was playing in Pomona, so my wife had to stay with some kids here. I am a little sad about that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, nearly every homeowner on Beth Court took thousands of dollars of equity out of their homes as values skyrocketed; properties that cost $120,000 in 1997 were worth more than $350,000 at the height of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The balloons have since floated back to earth, and the way houses are paid for has, too. Of the four houses on Beth Court that were foreclosed on between October 2008 and August 2009, two are now owned by families that got loans through the federal Housing Finance Agency program that allows borrowers to buy homes with lower down payments than conventional loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of them is the Almeida family. Joy now nearly bursts from the doors of their home at 11054 Beth Court, a two-story house with three bedrooms and a nice backyard. Last summer, it was a house in foreclosure, where children sat home alone in front of the television while their mother marched dolefully to her job at the mall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late October, the house was bought by Jose Almeida for $150,000, about 70 percent of what the previous owners paid for it in 2003. It is the Almeidas' first home; they previously lived in an apartment in a struggling neighborhood in Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We put down everything we have, but we're so happy,'' said Mr. Almeida, standing with his wife, Maria, on the newly tiled kitchen floor. ''It's so quiet at night, my wife says to me, 'How come we can't hear anything?' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Connie and Ted Hanson were anomalies on the sidelines of Beth Court -- retired, older and living at the entrance to the cul-de-sac on adjoining Parkland Avenue. Having saved and spent wisely over the decades, they were able to travel to Europe each summer and take off in their camper whenever the whim grabbed them, as it often did.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And for years, they were the glue that kept the neighborhood together -- leading the neighborhood association, tending to neglected front lawns, checking in on troubled friends and giving odd jobs to the neighborhood kids.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Hansons' daughter lost her teaching job in Northern California last summer, and in a sudden reversal of fortunes, the Hansons now look to the neighborhood for support as they have taken in their daughter and her two sons, ages 13 and 9. (Turtles and tarantulas were part of the package.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hansons once paid the Winkler girls to feed their cat and water the plants while they were away; now their 13-year-old grandson cuts the Winklers' lawn. The strain of three new mouths to feed and that many more loads of laundry is upon the Hansons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not exactly a hardship,'' Mr. Hanson said. ''We're still going to Europe next year.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Yes, but we don't have the extra income anymore,'' Mrs. Hanson countered. ''You go to spend $100 now and you think twice.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is still joblessness on the block, but Adrian Blanco, who lost his job as an electrician when he hurt his back a year ago, shares the unyielding sense of optimism here these days. After months of being rebuffed for a mortgage modification -- something many troubled homeowners have run into -- Mr. Blanco got his monthly payment reduced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Blanco and his wife, Gloria, had just come back from a leisurely walk on a recent Sunday afternoon, relaxing together for the first time in months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I haven't found work yet, and I am in constant pain,'' he said. ''But I'm happy. I'm still here.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A THREE-BEDROOM THREE-BATH OCEANFRONT HOME IN ROSARITO, MEXICO</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">$895,000</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This 20-year-old house, with its six fireplaces and sloping brick ceilings, is in Rosarito, about 30 kilometers (19 miles) southwest of Tijuana. In local parlance, it is at ''KM 40,'' 40 kilometers (or about 25 miles) down the Ensenada highway from the American border in the Mexican state of Baja California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This 5,000-square-foot house is in a 20-home gated community called Rosamar. At the back is a grand lawn overlooking the Pacific Ocean, a large patio (with fireplace) and a circular meditation pit dug into a hillside. In the summer, dolphins can be seen swimming by; in February, on occasion, there are whales. Mexico's Coronado Islands are in the distance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the rooms on the main floor have arched cupola ceilings made from brick made by artisans from Guadalajara. Off the entrance foyer, to the right, is a library. Beyond that room is a 500-square-foot artists' studio with a grand piano. On the other side of the entrance foyer is the dining room and an oceanfront terrace. The kitchen has Mexican-style tiles and cabinets. The living room has several seating areas, a large fireplace, a pool table and, of course, more views. Here and there are sunlit nooks appropriate for reading and/or dozing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Upstairs, the master bedroom has wooden plank floors and a double entry into an en-suite bathroom with a Jacuzzi and midnight-blue tiles; there's also a 600-square-foot outdoor terrace with 180-degree views up and down the Baja coastline. The house has a second bedroom on the top floor, as well as a bedroom and bathroom below the library.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rosamar is one of several communities on the Ensenada highway near Tijuana and Rosarito, many of them gated and catering to Americans and other foreign buyers. The development has a pool, Jacuzzi and tennis courts for community use. The nearest border crossing is to San Ysidro, Calif., from Tijuana, about 45 minutes away; a five-year $129 pass called a Sensor Enabled Neural Threat Recognition and Identification card, or Sentri, is sold by the American Customs and Border Protection agency to reduce border waits by around 10 to 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARKET OVERVIEW</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, with Mexico's well-reported crime problem, prices in the Tijuana area have dropped around 10 to 15 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''About two and a half years ago, it was booming,'' said Pam Chisholm, owner of Discover Baja Real Estate in Rosarito. ''A lot of the sellers jacked their prices up so high, thinking they had a goldmine. They're coming down to reality now, and they're pricing them better.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Biondolillo, president of Baja 123 Mexican Real Estate, said that the negative coverage of local crime had begun to recede, helping prices stabilize.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was brutal a year ago,'' Mr. Biondolillo said. ''Now the market that should have been here all along is starting to come back. We just had the best two months in the last three years.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate agents in the area are quick to point out that most communities along the oceanfront have their own security forces, and that they all feel safe living and working around Tijuana and Rosarito. (Tijuana has implemented a police reform program over the last year, with plans to hire 150 new officers in 2010.) Oceanfront homes in the area range from $500,000 to $1 million, said Diane Gibbs, owner of Gibbs and Associates in Rosarito Beach, the listing agent for the property featured here. Houses within view of the ocean, but built behind the oceanfront properties, begin around $300,000, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are a number of condominium developments along the coastline, including a complex called La Jolla Real just south of Rosarito. There, Mr. Biondolillo said, he has recently sold 10 units, with prices ranging from the low $200,000s to the $600,000s. Larger units can sell for as much as $1 million, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inland, prices come down significantly, starting around $100,000. There, ''you won't hear the water,'' Ms. Gibbs said, but you can probably see it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHO BUYS IN TIJUANA AND ROSARITO</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the buyers near the ocean are Americans, typically from California, though vacation home-seekers from Texas and Chicago are not uncommon. In addition, Mr. Biondolillo said, Canadians have arrived, thanks in part to their currency's performance against the dollar (and the peso).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BUYING BASICS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans buying property in Mexico first need a tourist visa, which is in turn required to obtain an FM3, a permit to live in Mexico that must be renewed annually. An FM3 can be obtained at a Mexican Consulate in the United States, of which there are over two dozen, or an immigration office in Mexico; bank statements, copies of passports and a fee of about $150 are required. (After five years, foreigners can apply for an FM2, a more permanent form of residency. The step after that is Mexican citizenship.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When a property sale is initiated, foreigners typically submit their funds to an escrow company, Ms. Gibbs said. The money is held there until the sale is final and approved by government officials. (Escrow fees can run as high as $1,000, Mr. Biondolillo said.) After that, the money is transferred to the seller, and the title to the buyer. Baja Mexico is within a restricted zone, foreign buyers are typically required to set up 50-year trusts, called fideicomisos, with Mexican banks; the cost is about $500 per year, Ms. Chisholm said. The trusts can be renewed in perpetuity. Title insurance can be acquired through American companies like Stewart and First American.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers pay a 2 percent transfer tax at the time of sale, Mr. Biondolillo said. Annual property tax is typically quite low, he added -- $150 to $200 for a $300,000 property. Notary, survey and appraisal fees, as well as a certificate of no liens, make up an additional 4 percent of the purchase price, Ms. Gibbs said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By DAVID STREITFELD </div><div>999 words</div><div>6 January 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of houses placed under contract fell sharply in November in the first drop in nearly a year, figures released Tuesday show. It was the clearest sign yet that predictions of another downturn in real estate may become a reality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said that its index of pending home sales plunged to 96 from a revised level of 114.3 in October. Analysts had predicted a drop, but nothing like that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We thought it would drop 2 percent,'' said Jennifer Lee of BMO Capital Markets. ''When you see 16 percent, the first thing you say is, what the heck happened here?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the majority of pending sales become final in six weeks to two months, the index is considered a reliable indicator of where the market is headed. The index is calculated by comparing the number of pending sales with the level of 2001, when the index was formulated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data indicates that the weakest parts of the country are the Northeast and Midwest, both of which fell 26 percent in November from the previous month after adjusting for seasonal variations. The South dropped 15 percent, while the West was off 3 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Lee called the drop from October to November ''unnerving'' but said that the index remained well above the level of a year ago. In November 2008, when the financial crisis was at its peak and buying a home required a faith in the future that many did not feel, the index was 83.1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the overall economy improves and the employment situation grows a little less dire, the question becomes whether real estate can muddle through -- or if it will need a new round of government support to ward off another damaging downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are plenty of reasons for worry. The Obama administration's effort to compel lenders and servicers to modify loans has not been a success. Many of these owners will eventually lose their homes to foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, a quarter of homeowners with mortgages owe more than their houses are worth. If prices start dropping again, some will be induced to walk away, further undermining the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I wouldn't rule out more stimulus, especially in an election year,'' said Ivy Zelman, an analyst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year's stimulus efforts, however expensive and divisive, calmed a market where prices had plummeted by a third. Even now, the government's efforts to push down interest rates and entice buyers with a tax credit appear to be having an effect, keeping a weak market from getting weaker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Walter Martin and Paloma Munoz, artists in Dingmans Ferry, Pa., are a stimulus success story. They are paying $360,000 for a new home 10 miles away without even having an offer for their current home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The new home has enough space for us both to have studios,'' Ms. Munoz said. ''The price is amazing, we are getting a mortgage at a 5.125 rate, and we qualify for a $6,500 credit.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a leap of faith, she acknowledged, but an eminently sensible one. ''When houses were expensive, everyone wanted to buy, and now that they're cheap everyone is scared,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers like Ms. Munoz and Mr. Martin are outnumbered, however, by people who think the market still has room to fall. While some of these may indeed be scared, others simply see a virtue in patience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With two growing boys, we are busting out of our small house,'' said Stephen Sencer, deputy general counsel at Emory University in Atlanta. ''But I'm still waiting for sellers to capitulate.'' His agent is telling Mr. Sencer that may happen in the spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starting from a low of 80.4 last January, pending sales rose for nine consecutive months in 2009. The index proved a harbinger of both completed sales, which began climbing in April, and prices, which started rising over the summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the Nov. 30 expiration of the tax credit drew near, would-be buyers hastened to secure deals. Sales in November roared at a 6.54 million annual pace, the highest since February 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the last minute, Congress extended and broadened the credit. The urgency immediately dissipated. ''We were really, really pushing hard, and I think everyone just wore out,'' said Steve Havig, president of Lakes Area Realty of Minneapolis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers now have until April 30 to qualify for the credit. Many analysts say the effect this time around will be mild.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It could turn out the second credit has such a small impact it doesn't show up in the data,'' said Patrick Newport of IHS Global Insight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, he predicts the downturn this time will be gentler. ''The economy is improving, and that is what the market needs to get back on a sustainable path,'' Mr. Newport said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long before the tax credit ends, another stimulus effort is due to disappear. The Federal Reserve has bought more than a trillion dollars of mortgage-backed securities in a successful effort to push down mortgage rates. The Fed is scheduled to wind down the program by March 31.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rates are already moving higher, exceeding 5 percent in some lender surveys. Perhaps as a result, mortgage applications to buy homes in late December were a third lower than during the corresponding period in 2008, the Mortgage Bankers Association said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed's Open Market Committee left itself leeway in its December meeting to start buying again, saying it ''will continue to evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purchases of securities.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising rates could hamper Mr. Martin and Ms. Munoz's search for a buyer for their old house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's been on the market for almost three months,'' she said. ''We have had very few viewings.''</p>

</div><div class="author">By ELIZABETH A. HARRIS </div><div>778 words</div><div>5 January 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>16</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2009 Manhattan real estate market ended on a better note than it began, according to fourth-quarter reports that were to be released Tuesday by the city's largest brokerages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The improvements in the market that began over the summer pushed through to the end of the year. Most reports found that sales increased from the third quarter to the fourth, which helped eat away at the inventory of unsold apartments. Prices, meanwhile, stayed about flat -- some of the reports showed slight increases, but most showed small declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Considering where we came from, the results this quarter were much better than we could've imagined a year ago at this time,'' said Jonathan J. Miller, president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel, who prepares the market report for Prudential Douglas Elliman. ''There are a lot of challenges ahead for housing, but I think the worst is behind us.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dottie Herman, president of Prudential Douglas Elliman, said that in the first half of 2009, apartment sales were low. ''People were thinking, If I buy this, will the market go down more?'' Ms. Herman said. ''You don't have that any more. People feel the market has pretty much bottomed out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Prudential report showed that the median sale price in Manhattan was $810,000 in the fourth quarter of 2009, a 10 percent drop over the same period in 2008 and a 4.7 percent decline over the third quarter of 2009. The average sale price, $1.296 million, was down 2.1 percent since last summer and 12.7 percent since the fourth quarter of last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate sales figures usually represent contracts signed several months earlier. Mr. Miller said that the median sale price of $810,000 in Manhattan was down 21 percent from the peak of $1.025 million in the second quarter of 2008. The average sale price of nearly $1.3 million last quarter was 24.8 percent lower than the peak of $1.72 million in the first quarter of 2008. Prudential said the number of sales increased 10.9 percent from the third quarter to the fourth last year, and they were 8.4 percent higher than in the fourth quarter of 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was unusual to have such an active fourth quarter, which includes many holidays. ''Over the last couple of years, prices leveled off and activity went down sharply in the fourth quarter,'' said Gregory J. Heym, chief economist at Terra Holdings, who prepares reports for Halstead Property and Brown Harris Stevens. ''That hasn't happened'' in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's unusual to see this kind of strength continuing in the fourth quarter,'' Mr. Heym added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventory has been reduced by the rise in sales that started in the summer. That is unusual because the busiest time for sales in the city is usually the spring. The Prudential report found that inventory had fallen 18.3 percent since the third quarter of 2009 and 24.6 percent since the fourth quarter of last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventory is now 6,851 listings, just shy of the 10-year quarterly average of 7,094, Mr. Miller said. Some of the decline in inventory, however, is seasonal. Sellers often pull their homes off the market before the holidays and put them back on in the new year. Those owners might be joined by many others who have sat on the sidelines for the last year or so, hoping to wait out the economic storm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even with willing buyers and sellers, there is a third party to consider: the banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lending remains extremely tight, especially for ''jumbo'' mortgages, those above $729,750. In Manhattan, these represent a much larger part of the market than in most parts of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's still a struggle,'' said Pam Liebman, president of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>. ''The inflexibility of the jumbo mortgage market does continue to kill some deals out there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for anyone who can get a mortgage, rates are still low. They have nowhere to go but up, and this year, some economists say, they are likely to rise, which could put some downward pressure on the market. High unemployment and concerns about commercial real estate foreclosures could play a part as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are a lot of concern in the economy,'' said Mr. Heym of Terra Holdings. ''We want to see jobs added again; it's hard to know what a bunch of commercial foreclosures would mean. I think we're at a state where things are getting better; it's just going to be a slow recovery.''</p>

</div><div class="author">By CHARLES V. BAGLI </div><div>747 words</div><div>5 January 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>15</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2004, the Domino Sugar refinery that occupied five blocks along the Brooklyn waterfront in Williamsburg for more than 150 years shut down, joining the neighboring brick factories as remnants of the area's industrial past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now a developer is beginning a public review of a proposal to turn the vacant 11-acre industrial site into a $1.5 billion residential complex, reusing the refinery and installing the historic, 40-foot-tall Domino Sugar sign (now on a separate building) on top. There would be 2,200 apartments in all. The developer also plans to build a waterfront esplanade and a set of new glass and brick buildings that would range from 6 to 40 stories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We saw this as an opportunity to create what is best in New York: a mixed-income community, with a lot of affordable housing and some pretty interesting architecture, on a waterfront that's been closed to the public for 150 years,'' said the developer, Michael D. Lappin, chief executive of the <span class="companylink">Community Preservation Corporation</span>, a nonprofit group, and CPC Resources, its for-profit subsidiary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An unusually large percentage of the apartments, 30 percent, or 660 units, would be set aside for low- and moderate-income families and distributed throughout the project. (Generally, development projects promise to dedicate 20 percent of their units for such housing.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan might sound a little ambitious, given the recession. And the project still faces some criticism from community advocates who say the project may be too densely packed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city's land-use review for the project started Monday at the City Planning Commission with a public hearing and the certification of the developer's proposal. Over the next seven months, various governmental entities -- from the local community board to the City Council -- will weigh in on the plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the years since the last sugar cubes were packed into cartons at the refinery, the neighborhood has been the center of the residential building boom and then the real estate downturn. More than one-fifth of the 500 projects stalled in New York City are in Williamsburg.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But like a few other developers, Mr. Lappin said he had adopted a slow, multiphased approach. It will take nearly a year to get city approval; once that is secured, only the first building will immediately go up -- on the east side of Kent Avenue, between South Third and South Fourth Streets. The rest will follow on the waterfront parcel, with construction to be completed in 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the market is inundated with luxury housing, Mr. Lappin said, there was a continuing need for housing for teachers, construction workers, clerks and low-income families. <span class="companylink">Community Preservation Corporation</span>, a lending consortium of banks and insurance companies, has financed $7.2 billion in mostly affordable housing in its 35-year existence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lappin's company and his partners have already spent more than $125 million on the land, environmental assessments, architects and plans. The architect Rafael Vinoly designed the transformation plan for what is known as the New Domino, while Beyer Blinder Belle, the architectural firm, drew up the plan to convert the 12-story refinery building, which was declared a landmark in 2007, into 241 apartments, with shops, a community center and a multilevel rooftop structure that would rise as high as four stories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The original plan was to sell condominiums on the site and use the profit to subsidize the low- and moderate-income units. That may still happen, but Mr. Lappin acknowledged that the current condo market was soft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter Gillespie, executive director of Neighbors Allied for Good Growth in Williamsburg, credited the developer with a well-designed plan, nice open space and the inclusion of a high percentage of apartments for low- and moderate-income residents. But, he added, ''there's a concern about the size and scale of the buildings. There's greater density here than other developers have gotten.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christopher Olechowski, chairman of Community Board 1, which includes the Domino site, agreed. ''It's a trade-off,'' he said. ''They will have to make some really strong arguments about affordable housing versus density and height. It's not going to be an easy sell.''</p>

</div><div class="author">By JIM ROBBINS </div><div>927 words</div><div>5 January 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HELENA, Mont. -- Investors at four high-end resorts have filed a class-action lawsuit against <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> and the real estate services company Cushman &amp;Wakefield, contending that they conspired to inflate the value of the properties so they could take them over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The suit, outlined in an 84-page complaint filed Sunday in federal court in Boise, Idaho, details what it calls a sweeping loan-to-own scheme. <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span>, according to the complaint, raked in huge fees on loans against the properties, which it syndicated and sold to hedge fund managers. If the resorts could not pay back the hundreds of millions of dollars in loans, based on the inflated values, <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> could either assume ownership as the agent for the creditors or sell the resorts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The properties include the Yellowstone Club at Big Sky, Mont., which has multimillion-dollar ''ski-in-ski-out'' homes and private slopes. Its members include Bill Gates, the <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> chairman; the golfer Annika Sorenstam; former Vice President Dan Quayle; and Peter Chernin, former president and chief operating officer of the <span class="companylink">News Corporation</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, developers and property owners at Lake Las Vegas in southern Nevada, the Tamarack Resort in central Idaho and Ginn sur Mer in the Bahamas are also party to the lawsuit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The suit was brought on behalf of at least 3,000 investors by L. J. Gibson, who owns property at three of the resorts, and Beau Blixseth, the son and business partner of Timothy L. Blixseth, the developer who bought land near Yellowstone Park and developed the famous club. The involvement of 4,000 to 5,000 more litigants at 10 other resorts, including the Promontory Club in Utah, is pending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> spokesman, Duncan King, said, ''We believe the suit to be without merit, and we will defend ourselves vigorously.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dwayne Doherty, a spokesman for Cushman &amp;Wakefield, which provided appraisals of the property, echoed that statement. ''The allegations are completely without merit, and we will defend ourselves vigorously,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lead lawyer in the suit, Michael J. Flynn, of Rancho Santa Fe, Calif., said he could not comment until the judge allowed the class action to proceed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The suit accuses the defendants of engaging in a sweeping conspiracy that focused on the developers of the resorts. Specifically, the complaint accuses <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> and Cushman &amp;Wakefield of racketeering, breach of fiduciary duty, mail and wire fraud, money laundering and negligence. The suit describes <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> as an ''international banking predator.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the complaint, the plaintiffs' lawyers contend that <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> and Cushman &amp;Wakefield conspired by setting up a Cayman Islands branch to circumvent federal law on real estate appraisals. The complaint also alleges that they inflated the value of the resorts and made millions of dollars in fees on loans against the properties. <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> knew the resorts would most likely default under the weight of inflated values, which would allow the bank to take ownership as agent on behalf of the creditors, the suit contends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Yellowstone Club borrowed $375 million from <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> in 2005. After the economy began to falter, Edra Blixseth, who won control of the property in a divorce from her husband, Timothy, was forced to declare bankruptcy in 2008. The property was sold to CrossHarbor Capital Partners in 2009 for $115 million, about a quarter of the estimated value of the club at the peak of the market, though <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> retained the right to collect the loan after it was sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May, in the Blixseth bankruptcy case, Judge Ralph B. Kirscher of Federal Bankruptcy Court in Butte, Mont., wrote: ''The naked greed in this case, combined with <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span>'s complete disregard'' for the developer and others, ''shocks the conscience of this court.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''While <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span>'s new loan product resulted in enormous fees to <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> in 2005, it resulted in financial ruin for several residential resort communities,'' he wrote. ''<span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> lined its pockets on the backs of the unsecured creditors.'' The statement was written in a judge's order that has since been vacated as part of a settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The complaint also contends that the money to finance loans came from a separate case in which <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> helped Iranian banks avoid United States sanctions by hiding profits. <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> paid the government $536 million in December to settle that case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The suit seeks $8 billion in damages, which it says should be tripled as allowed under federal racketeering statutes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline at many posh Western resorts has been stunning. Values have dropped precipitously, projects are unfinished and investor interest has waned. At the Tamarack Resort, 90 miles north of Boise, the tennis star Andre Agassi has abandoned plans to build a five-star hotel, unfinished buildings have been mothballed and <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> is asking a court to allow it to repossess the resort's ski lifts. Homeowners who bought property and built homes are fuming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In November, the new owners of the Yellowstone Club liquidated 13 tractor-trailer loads of antique furniture bought by the Blixseths, including a two-seat black walnut throne from a castle in Bavaria that Timothy Blixseth once planned to place in his 53,000-square-foot home. That home was never built.</p>

</div><div class="author">By CHARLES V. BAGLI </div><div>695 words</div><div>4 January 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>14</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The central tower at ground zero, designed to rise to 105 stories, has been characterized by some as a symbol of New York's resilience, and reviled by others as a white elephant. Now it will pick up a new label: for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey</span> wants to sell the skyscraper, the former Freedom Tower, known now by its original name, 1 World Trade Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent days, the Port Authority has asked a select group of commercial real estate developers and owners to bid for a partnership interest in the $3.2 billion tower, according to a developer who was contacted by the authority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The offering would allow the authority to raise what it hopes would be at least $100 million for the project. But the authority wants its new partner to take on the difficult task of marketing the skyscraper's space and negotiating leases with corporate tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephen Sigmund, a spokesman for the authority, acknowledged that a potential sale was in the offing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As 1 World Trade Center continues to rise into the city skyline,'' he said Thursday, ''the timing is right to determine whether there is a strategic partnership that can add long-term success to the building.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the steel latticework is only about five floors above street level today, the skyscraper has been laden with enormous symbolic weight since its inception. It will stand 1,776 feet tall, in a nod to the country's founding. The tower, with 2.6 million square feet, will also be among the most expensive office buildings in North America when it is completed in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales effort is likewise just getting off the ground. According to executives briefed on the Port Authority's strategy, it has hired two real estate advisers, Cushman &amp;Wakefield and <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>, to handle the negotiations with the prospective partners. The authority has identified a half-dozen companies with the financial wherewithal and the commercial expertise for the job, including Boston Properties, the Related Companies, the Durst real estate family, Hines, <span class="companylink">Vornado Realty Trust</span> and <span class="companylink">Brookfield Properties</span>, which owns the adjacent World Financial Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bidders are being asked to sign a confidentiality agreement and are being given access to a restricted Web site with detailed information about the skyscraper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not an especially auspicious time to be selling real estate. Values have plunged since the market peaked in 2007. Rents are down by as much as 45 percent, according to real estate brokers. And the office vacancy rate downtown is expected to climb above 10 percent as A.I.G., the insurance giant, reduces its presence and <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> moves this year to its new heavily subsidized headquarters near ground zero.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Port Authority is also at loggerheads with the developer Larry A. Silverstein, who leased the World Trade Center only weeks before it was destroyed in 2001. Mr. Silverstein wants to build three office towers at ground zero with Port Authority financing, but given the lack of demand, the authority favors a slow, phased approach to construction. The two sides are in the last stage of arbitration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, a number of real estate investors have recently created funds to buy real estate, at the right price. The publicly traded real estate investment trusts, like Vornado and Boston Properties, raised tens of billions of dollars this year, in part to take advantage of falling prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Port Authority, executives say, believes it has a saleable asset.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a substantial amount of real estate equity capital looking for the right investment,'' said Michael Rotchford, the executive vice president at Cushman who is handling the partnership sale for the authority. ''We think this is potentially one of the best real estate investments available in New York.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, the Beijing Vantone Industrial Company, a Chinese real estate firm, signed a 23-year lease for the 64th through 69th floors at 1 World Trade Center. The authority has also signed preliminary agreements with the state and federal governments for an additional one million square feet.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mechanic, 57, is a partner in the law firm Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver &amp;Jacobson and also the chairman of its real estate department. He has represented most major developers in Manhattan, along with real estate investment trusts, investors and tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among his many transactions was the sale of Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. You're one of the best-connected real estate lawyers in the world. How did that transpire?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Well, I'm very business-oriented in my approach to practicing law. I'm very focused on what the client is trying to achieve, and I think I have a reputation for integrity. That makes it a lot easier to get transactions done because people can rely on what you say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. You also have a background in development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I spent five years -- from '81 to '86 -- as a general counsel and managing director of HRO International, which was run by Howard Ronson, and built about 2.5 million square feet of office space in New York. I was involved in all aspects of development. That has really contributed to my understanding and perspective on real estate and transactions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. How many deals do you work on each year, on average?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I couldn't even tell you, because there are some transactions that I'm more heavily involved with than others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Are you busier now than a year or so ago?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We're actually very busy, to the point where I'm looking forward to having some new people starting in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Six months or a year ago people didn't know where pricing ought to be, and therefore it was harder to transact business. We've reached a point where people are in agreement on what values are.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I think the mood is clearly up -- we noticed it at our holiday party. It was at Cipriani; 1,000 people showed up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. What are you working on?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We're actively involved in closing Atlantic Yards in Brooklyn. I've been involved recently in one portion of the financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I was involved with East River Plaza, a retail development just completed on the F.D.R. Drive between 116th Street and 119th Street. I represented the Blumenfeld family, one of the original owners of the site, and I facilitated a partnership between Forest City Ratner and the Blumenfelds. To have seen this from what was known as the Washburn Wire Factory -- dilapidated, abandoned buildings -- to a new development creating jobs, and to know I was a part of the many elements of that, is great.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We're also working with Related on the Hudson Yards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Are you dealing with distressed-property transactions?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I'm dealing with properties that are being restructured. If they were purchased based on a different set of assumptions, and the world is in a different place, then people have to decide how to deal with them going forward. That may be restructuring debt, extending terms, converting debt to equity, or creating a joint venture with lender and borrower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Speaking of distressed real estate, you represented Macklowe Properties through its ups and downs, including the sale of its prized General Motors building. Is the company still a client?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We do represent the Macklowes. They've worked out issues with lenders and are looking at other alternatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Ever have two clients across the table from each other?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. It happens a lot. I have had transactions where the seller is a client and I'm representing the buyer. It's all disclosed up front, and actually, in many circumstances, it's helpful because there's a pre-existing relationship and there's a trust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My guide is even if both clients are prepared to consent, if I don't feel comfortable then I don't feel that I can suitably represent the client in that circumstance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. What has been your most challenging deal thus far?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Perhaps the most challenging was the acquisition of 200 Park, the MetLife Building. It was $1.4 billion and a very compressed time frame.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Do you invest in real estate?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I own some retail and office space in Bergen County. I manage that with my wife, Wendy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. This spring you'll be teaching a real estate transactions course at Harvard Law School.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I've done this several years already. It's fun to give back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The class is set up for one o'clock on Friday, because I only wanted people in the class who really wanted to be there.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPE CORAL, Fla. -- FELLOW adventurers, refugees from winter and armchair archaeologists, we are here on this shiny green tour bus to embark on a safari of sorts. We'll be exploring the local habitat, as upended and reconfigured by an epochal real estate fiasco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our guide, Marc Joseph, stalks wildlife of the white-elephant variety. A real estate agent, he specializes in houses that proved financially disastrous for someone -- the banker, the homeowner, the American taxpayer, often all three. Mr. Joseph's bus is emblazoned with red letters spelling the name of this thrill ride: ForeclosureToursRUs.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As we navigate this speculator's paradise turned financial wasteland, Mr. Joseph stands at the front of the bus in a green polo shirt, highlighting specimens like this one: a white stucco house fronted by palm trees and topped by a Spanish tile roof on a canal emptying into the Gulf of Mexico. It last sold in 2005 for $850,000. Yours today for $273,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''How much cheaper does it have to go before you say, 'Well, that's just craziness,' '' Mr. Joseph beseeches as our tour group -- mostly retirees from up North, basking in Bermuda shorts on another December day stolen from winter -- examines the swimming pool and the Jacuzzi. ''I'm telling you now, your opportunity is banging at your door.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, it has come to this in Cape Coral, a reluctant symbol for the excesses of the great American real estate bubble: foreclosed homes served up as tourist attraction. The struggles and pain that produced this ecosystem are neatly masked by the newly installed granite countertops, pristine carpets and fresh coats of paint that now ornament many properties on the tour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I am on the bus because, two years earlier, I spent a week here looking at the myriad ways in which plunging home prices were undermining the American dream. Cape Coral and the Fort Myers metropolitan area were confronting an especially potent cauldron of troubles. Unemployment was soaring, and tax revenue was plunging, forcing cuts in government services and intensifying anxiety.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now I am back to see what has happened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dominant pursuit of the moment here is cleaning up The Mess left behind by the era of easy money. The Mess is found in the glut of vacant commercial spaces; in the local unemployment rate, now pushing 14 percent; and in the discarded furniture at curbside and the overgrown front lawns left by some of those relinquishing their homes to foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've been at the epicenter of this,'' says Frank Cassidy, a retired Los Angeles police officer who heads Cape Coral's code enforcement division, which carts away much of the detritus. ''We're the front line on blight.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He lays out a satellite map showing the city of Cape Coral, a thumb-shape expanse jutting into the gulf. It shows 64,571 single-family homes. Each one touched by foreclosure over the last three years is marked red, as if the city were stricken with a rash: 18,575 red dots pockmark the map.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kristy Clifton -- at 30, the youngest member of the code enforcement team -- patrols northwestern Cape Coral in her white Ford Taurus, summoning colleagues to help with the latest clean-out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not work for the squeamish. Some people depart in a rage, leaving graffiti on living room walls (profane suggestions about how bankers might rearrange their anatomy), mounds of trash, dirty diapers, even piles of human excrement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's pretty gross,'' says Ms. Clifton.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As she gathers the artifacts of lives gone wrong and deposits them into Dumpsters, she wonders what happened. ''People can just up and leave, and it seems like they leave their whole lives behind,'' she says. ''Army medals. Photo albums. Framed photos of children. Cribs. Toys. I don't know if they don't have anywhere to go or anywhere to put this stuff. But you'd think that pictures of your kids you'd take.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE MESS is the product of The Story, the fable that waterfront living beyond winter's reach exerts such a powerful pull that it justifies almost any price for housing. The Story propelled the orgy of borrowing, investing and flipping that dominated life here and in other places where January doesn't include a snow blower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Story lost its magic amid the realization that speculators had simply been selling to other speculators, making the real estate market look like a Ponzi scheme. The ensuing crash was breathtaking. By the winter of 2007, median housing prices in Cape Coral and the rest of Lee County had fallen to about $215,000, down from a high of $278,000 in 2005. By October 2009, they had fallen to near $92,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Somewhere on that long, steep downhill path, what was once portrayed here as a momentary if wrenching setback seeped into the community's bones, embedding lowered expectations and fear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first time I visited in 2007, James W. Browder, the Lee County schools superintendent, had recently scrapped plans to construct seven new schools. When I visited last month, he detailed how one-fourth of his elementary schools were now sending home weekly backpacks of food with students.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One elementary school principal noticed parents going into schools with kids in the morning and sitting down in the cafeteria with them,'' Mr. Browder said. ''Then they noticed parents eating breakfast off kids' plates. And then they noticed parents taking scraps home.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Texas, the all-consuming gauge of prosperity is the price of a barrel of oil. Here, it was once the value of a developable parcel of land. Today, it is the volume of foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of 2007, the pace was already grim here, with foreclosures running at 1,100 a month, a more than fivefold increase from early that year, according to RealtyTrac, a real estate research firm. By late 2008, the pace had quickened again, to about 2,000 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the fall of 2009, foreclosures had fallen to about 1,400 a month, prompting hopes that the worst was over. But real estate agents and mortgage brokers wary of optimism are focusing on a new term that has entered the housing lexicon: ghost inventory. Banks appear to be sitting on thousands of homes caught in limbo, neither foreclosing nor receiving any payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're not in a recession,'' says Bobby Mahan, an amiable broker here, describing conditions in the area. ''We're in a depression.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two years ago, Mr. Mahan's office, Selling Paradise, displayed a sign that seemed unusual at the time. It invited customers to come in for a free list of available foreclosed properties. Now, nearly every surviving real estate agent seeks business with such signs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Out in Lehigh Acres, a sprawling empire of cookie-cutter ranch houses, agents once worked in a strip of model properties, waiting in pristinely carpeted living rooms with plates of cookies for prospective buyers. Today, many of the models have themselves succumbed to foreclosure. Those still going are draped in banners offering foreclosure expertise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices are now so low that inventory is moving. From the beginning of last year through October, the Fort Myers metropolitan area had already had 14,000 sales of single-family homes -- more than in all of 2007 and 2008 combined. Roughly three-fourths of the deals were foreclosed homes and short sales, in which property sells for less than the bank is owed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet about three-fourths of the buyers have been paying cash, an apparent indication that most are investors, not ordinary homeowners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That doesn't give me a lot of confidence,'' says Cape Coral's newly elected mayor, John Sullivan. ''Where are they going to sell these properties? The party's over.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a select few, however, the party rages on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Allen Olofson-Ring, a clean-cut, sandy-haired, Harvard-educated real estate agent from Boston, is enjoying his best year since entering the local real estate business seven years ago. He has parlayed longstanding relationships with mortgage companies -- Chase, in particular -- into the acquisition of exclusive rights to selling their foreclosed properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in 2006, the end of the bubble, Mr. Olofson-Ring sold about 27 properties for a total value of roughly $14 million. By December, he was on pace to complete 800 deals valued at $41 million. ''These are the greatest times,'' he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he gets new listings, he visits the properties to see whether they are occupied. To get inside, he uses the tools that fill the trunk of his Nissan Altima: a power drill, specialty keys, flathead screwdrivers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It can get wild,'' he says. ''We're about to break in the house -- no, rephrase that -- gain entry, and some guy comes out half-naked and says, 'What you doing in my house, boy?' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he encounters residents, he offers them cash to vacate, from $500 to $3,000, while threatening eviction if they stay. Then, he puts the houses on the market, priced to sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I get numb to it, I guess, because I've done so many,'' he says. ''It's a little surreal. You feel bad. It gnaws at you. At the same time, what are you going to do? Life goes on.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What are you going to do? This question has insinuated itself seemingly everywhere here, like a soundtrack stuck on an infinite loop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dave Robison has lived in northwest Cape Coral since 2002, when he moved down from Cincinnati, paying $160,000 for his house. He figured that he would stay until his house fetched enough to allow him to retire full time in Mexico. Now, he bitterly regrets that he didn't cash in back in 2005, when the house was worth perhaps $400,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He walks his two greyhounds past a tan stucco house on the corner, where the grass on the lawn reaches three feet high, possibly sheltering possums and snakes. An official abatement notice is tacked to the front door, ordering the owner -- someone in Reseda, Calif. -- to cut the grass. A house across the street is similarly forlorn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You think you've got something and you don't,'' says Mr. Robison. ''There's nothing you can do but just ride it out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Farther down the block, another house sits cloaked in overgrown shrubbery with yet another abatement notice tacked to the door. Two years ago at this very house, I met the two women who were then living there -- Elaine and Charlene Pellegrino -- a mother and daughter. They were sifting through the belongings of Elaine's husband, Charlene's father, who had recently died, leaving them with two troubled businesses to run and debts they couldn't manage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elaine Pellegrino, then 53, was disabled, living on Social Security. Her daughter was jobless. They had resigned themselves to losing their home and had stopped making the mortgage payments. Yet they were cognizant that they could stay for many months as their case worked its way through a local court system already overwhelmed by foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now their days there have ended. Tax documents sit in a rain-matted stack in front of the garage. A ''for sale'' sign lies warped and discarded in the weeds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inside the house, bills are scattered across the floor with playing cards, a March 2008 TV Guide and the innards of a VCR. A plastic trash bag brimmed with foreclosure documents. Behind the house, green slime chokes the swimming pool -- the same green slime that now colonizes countless pools left to the elements in South Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Pellegrinos moved out in July 2008, Charlene explains. A bathroom pipe had burst, and mold had grown on the walls. She and her mother couldn't afford repairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strangest thing was how the bank implored them to stay, she says. Even after it became clear that they were not going to pay their mortgage, the bank figured that it would be better having them there to deter scavengers who would strip out the cabinets, the wiring, the toilets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They wanted us to stay on indefinitely,'' Charlene says. ''It was weird.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the Pellegrinos left, they found an upside to the bust: the seemingly limitless array of affordable rentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After walking away from their house and its $1,500 monthly mortgage payments, they rented a nearby four-bedroom home for $950 a month. Now Charlene, earning $2,400 a month as a home health worker, has designs on moving to a better place still, for $700 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KEVIN JARRETT is also on the move, adding his own house to the growing stock of local ghost inventory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Circumstances were already dire for Mr. Jarrett, a real estate agent, when I met him two years ago. He and his wife had arrived from Illinois in the mid-1990s, aggressively borrowing as they snared four properties. The peak came in the summer of 2007, when they paid $730,000 for a waterfront home in Cape Coral.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the end of that year, Mr. Jarrett hadn't closed a deal in months. He was falling behind on the mortgages for all four of his properties and had dropped his health insurance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Here we are, two years later, and there's no end to this,'' he says, leaning into a booth at the University Grill, a steak-and-lobster place he used to enjoy regularly during the boom years. ''I make a mean Hamburger Helper now.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deals have shrunk to almost nothing. Three of his four homes have been lost to foreclosure. He remains in the place on the water in Cape Coral, though he has not made a payment in roughly two years. ''Sometimes I think they just lost my file,'' he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house is mostly empty, owing to impromptu yard sales he conducts to keep food on the table. The piano, the sofa, the coffee table, the dining room table and chairs: all gone. His living and dining rooms are devoid, save for one piece of art he cannot bear to surrender: a statuette of Don Quixote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You know, dream the impossible dream,'' he says. ''It's just one of those little remnants to keep dreaming, because if you don't dream, you don't get anything.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His wife left in July 2008, he says, taking their daughter back to Illinois. (''Not having the finances to sustain the lifestyle you had is very trying on a relationship,'' he says.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last winter, a repo man came for Mr. Jarrett's boat, a 22-foot Hurricane power cruiser. In the spring, he sold his beloved yellow 2001 Corvette convertible for $13,500, paying $5,300 for a used 2000 Cadillac.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still boyish-looking at 50 despite his graying hair, Mr. Jarrett is starting over, moving down the coast to Marco Island, where houses sell for much more than they do here. A friend is offering a place to stay. His employer, Keller Williams, promises a desk in its local office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is full of gratitude, yet deeply unsettled by the reality that he is walking away from his dream home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You're admitting failure,'' he says. ''You signed a note and now you're not paying. As a human being, you have to process this. It's as tough as going through a divorce. You promised to be with this woman, but in the end, it wasn't working. Your neighbor is paying their mortgage every month. You feel that stigma that you're a loser.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He mows the lawn and trims the trees, in place of the landscaping service he gave up long ago. ''I try to somewhat justify my existence here by knowing that the bank is not getting a distressed property,'' he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a recent morning, he turned the knob on his bathroom sink to wash his hands and discovered that the water had been shut off for lack of payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What I've learned is the strength that you can reach down and get,'' he says. ''I'm the same guy. No matter what I had, I'm the same guy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE MESS is not without its spiritual element: the cleansing power of separation from worldly possessions. Marina memberships are no longer so abundant, yet Cape Coral is enjoying a bumper harvest in these taking-stock-of-what-matters moments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Pfaff and his wife, Diane, still mourn the loss of the 40-foot catamaran they owned back when he was bringing in huge commissions as a mortgage broker. But they still enjoy the water, albeit from a motorized rowboat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've been poor together, and we've been rich together,'' Mr. Pfaff says. ''It doesn't matter that much to us. We prefer to be rich, though.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Getting rich is a feat best accomplished here today by tapping into the inventory spawned by the unfortunate end to other people's richness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the sort of opportunistic thinking that prompted Mr. Joseph -- our tour guide on today's foreclosure safari -- to buy a bus on <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span>. After he bought the vehicle, which had previously been used to ferry parishioners to a Baptist church, he had it painted green, then added his new tour-company logo in red. (Another employer of the '''R' Us'' designation, <span class="companylink">Toys 'R' Us</span>, threatened legal action to force him to find another name, Mr. Joseph tells riders on his bus. He says he has agreed to change the name in the next few months.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tanned and sinewy with sunglasses nesting in his hair, Mr. Joseph looks and sounds like the comedian Ray Romano, minus the agita. He deals primarily in houses owned by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, the government-backed mortgage financier. He cleans and sometimes renovates them before putting them on the market, clearing away The Mess in the service of selling an updated version of The Story.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a recent tour, eight potential buyers occupied the upholstered bench seats of his bus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Norm Tardie, a semiretiree down from Vermont, is hunting for bargain investments. A retired heating and air-conditioning contractor from Massachusetts in a yellow Hawaiian shirt is looking for a possible vacation place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Joseph indulges the classic shtick of the Florida sales pitch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Where we from?'' he asks one couple, who conveniently hail from Illinois.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''How cold is it in Illinois today?'' he asks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Impressively cold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''So we appreciate where we're at today,'' he says. ''That's the way we want you to feel when you walk into a house.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These prices cannot last! This is Mr. Joseph's essential message, one he expresses in a multitude of ways. ''You cannot purchase the bricks and mortar, and build a house for what they're selling for.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He lavishes particular attention on Paulette O'Rourke, a tan, reddish-blond retiree from Cincinnati, whose pink nails and enthusiasm make her seem game. She just bought one house here, and she likes the thought of owning another, as an investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not unimportantly, she has cash, roughly $100,000 in retirement funds from her old hospital job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You call up your financial guy,'' Mr. Joseph is saying, adopting the tones of the liberation theologian. ''You say, 'I want to sell all my stocks and mutual funds,' and you're done. You call him up and say: 'I'm taking control. I want to buy a house in Florida.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This idea is germinating as Ms. O'Rourke admires the swimming pool and the white ceramic tile at a house that sold for $350,000 three years ago and is now on the market for $164,500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is that opportunity,'' Mr. Joseph is saying. ''It is that time.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN the middle of Chelsea, an area known historically for artists and more recently for luxury condominiums, there is something unexpected: an active theological seminary that's been in the neighborhood since the 1820s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, the General Theological Seminary of the Episcopal Church has taken a cue from its surroundings in the interest of raising cash: an apartment building called the Chelsea Enclave has gone up on its grounds. It is scheduled for completion next month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chelsea Enclave apartments and the seminary take up a full city block. The new structure stretches from 20th to 21st Street along Ninth Avenue and the seminary winds across 20th Street, up 10th Avenue, and back toward Ninth Ave along 21st Street. Hidden in the center of the buildings is the seminary's garden, called the Close -- a secluded courtyard that is home to American elms and manicured grass, and feels closer to New England than it does to the C train.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We present every building as exotic and unique,'' said James Lansill, a senior managing director at Corcoran Sunshine, the brokerage handling sales. ''But this building has something that no one else has, and that is the view of the Close.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chelsea Enclave is a seven-story, 53-unit luxury condop with spacious one- to four-bedroom apartments, high-end finishes and a garage. The building's exterior, which was subject to approval by the Landmark Preservation Commission because the seminary is part of the Chelsea Historic District, was designed by Polshek Partnership Architects. It is made of glass and a red brick that matches the seminary buildings almost perfectly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartments run between $1.325 million and $10.75 million; a round of price cuts in April ranging from 6 to 14 percent brought the building to its current numbers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chelsea Enclave opened for advance sales on Sept. 15, 2008, the day <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> collapsed and the economy went into a tailspin. In addition to that painfully bad timing, the building was still under construction, and potential buyers had to content themselves with renderings and models. In recent years, plans and pretty pictures used to be enough for deals to go forward. Not anymore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Buyers literally refuse to buy in presales,'' Mr. Lansill said. ''People just don't believe the lobby is going to be nice, they don't believe that the apartments are going to have good finishes until they see it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, however, there are things to see and tires to kick. In the last three months, since around the time the lobby was finished and model apartments were available for show, six apartments have sold. That brings the total of apartments in contract up to 13, with another unit closed and one contract pending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This project, like almost all new construction, is in a difficult position: Until a certain percentage of apartments have sold, many banks are unwilling to make loans to people who want to buy there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a little bit of a chicken-and-egg problem,'' said Melissa Cohn, the president of Manhattan Mortgage. ''In order to get the deals done, you need to get buyers into the building. But banks have been hesitant to let buyers into the building.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, Ms. Cohn says, some lenders are willing to take the plunge on this project -- she arranged one of the sales in the building herself -- though they demand a higher interest rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Slow presales have not been the only hitch at the Chelsea Enclave. The proposed size of the building caused quite a stir in the planning stages a few years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Originally, the seminary and the project's developer, the Brodsky Organization, envisioned a 17-story building replacing a mid-20th-century building called Sherrill Hall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A building that tall, however, required special approval, because this part of Chelsea has a height restriction of 75 feet. The proposed skyscraper hit stiff resistance from the community board and local politicians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They came forward with this out-of-scale building,'' State Senator Tom Duane said. ''This is the core of not just the historic district, but of the whole neighborhood. We fought them and we won.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eventually, the Brodsky Organization and the seminary settled for the standard seven-story limit and signed a land lease for 99 years and about $30 million, paid upfront.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though sales are slow, construction continues on schedule. And if it takes years to sell the entire building?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''So be it,'' said Daniel Brodksy, a managing partner at the Brodsky Organization. ''Our family has been in the real estate business for three generations, and we've never dropped a project. We've lived through great markets and through lousy markets. We've always held onto our buildings.''</p>

</div><div class="author">By CHRISTIAN L. WRIGHT </div><div>1187 words</div><div>3 January 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AT 11:30 on a Friday morning in December, SoHo was teeming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Broadway, Topshop overflowed with the aggressively chic; getting to the shoe racks at Bloomingdale's required at least one strategic hip-check; at Uniqlo, there were more people poring over the skinny jeans and affordable cashmere than there are gulls above a successful trawler. And never mind the sidewalk; it was an impossible-to-navigate sea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, just one block east, all was quiet on Crosby Street. Along the narrow cobblestone path, the solitude was pierced only by the UPS man waving to the doorman as he passed by 30 Crosby and a slim fellow in a well-cut car coat walking his Rhodesian Ridgeback. By afternoon, when the fireplaces were lighted at Savoy, the restaurant on the corner of Prince Street and Crosby, the pedestrian traffic hurrying to the east and to the west was heavy, but only a girl in a knit cap carrying a big bolt of fabric turned south onto Crosby, into the eastern territory of the SoHo-Cast Iron Historic District.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Crosby Street is just off the beaten track,'' said Craig Markham, the director of marketing and public relations for <span class="companylink">Firmdale Hotels</span>, the London-based company that opened the Crosby Street Hotel in September. ''It's a little bit quirky.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, when the Firmdale sales team started introducing the new hotel to long-established, top-level travel agents in New York City, some said, ''Now, where exactly is Crosby Street?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new hotel seems to be the crowning touch of the five-block stretch of Crosby that runs south of Houston Street to Howard Street, where the tourists don't really seem to go, where residential real estate prices hover around $5 million per condo, where unusual shops manage to thrive and where the atmosphere is very much old SoHo: sleepy, arty, industrial, mysterious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nonprofit Housing Works Bookstore Cafe anchors the northern end; the coveted designer Derek Lam just opened a gleaming glass-front shop at the southern end; and along the way are the unspoiled details of a bygone era.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are red brick buildings marked with the backward Z's of old fire escapes, cast-iron facades of 19th-century factories that don't rise over 10 stories, great big warehouse windows and slate-tiled roofs that borrow from European design. There are antiques and objets to be found (like an initialed Saxon armorial beaker, c. 1720, or a perfectly plausible daddy longlegs made of blown glass at De Vera), and funny little storefronts -- Saturdays Surf NYC, Michele Varian housewares, N 33 Crosby tapas bar -- that could easily be mistaken for private residences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stepping onto Crosby Street is a bit like entering a botanical garden in the middle of an urban throng. Minus the flowers, of course. Against some odds, Crosby Street has managed its revitalization without losing its character.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Lucy Wallace Eustice, a founder and an owner of the handbag company M Z Wallace, opened her first shop in 2000, she chose Crosby ''because of its character -- the forgotten street of SoHo.'' Megabrands like Chanel and Apple have opted for coordinates closer to the heart of SoHo, while the one-off stores along Crosby hark back to the days when artists lived and worked in the loft spaces and Dean &amp;Deluca was just a small grocery known as Giorgio's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not so long ago, Crosby was little more than a supply street to the big buildings on Broadway (shoppers don't seem to notice that there's an alternate entrance to Bloomingdale's on Crosby that's much more low-key than the main doors on Broadway), and in fact, the street's backdoor status may have served to protect it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three years ago, when Nathan Kornfeld bought his 4,000-square-foot full-floor loft at No. 30, between Broome and Grand Streets, he didn't know the street well enough to realize how lucky he was.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Upper East Side is really dense and not as casual,'' said Mr. Kornfeld, a partner at the private equity firm Patron Capital. ''We looked in TriBeCa, but this was the best value. There are not a lot of lofts of this vintage and this size. It's kind of unique.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apartment 3A at 30 Crosby Street, a 4,100-square-foot open loft with pine floors, single slab marble countertops and a fireplace, is currently for sale for $4.9 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential real estate at the high end has suffered during the recent economic downturn and, according to industry analyses, no neighborhood has been immune. Corcoran reports that in the third quarter of 2009, the median price of an apartment in Manhattan was $799,000, an 18 percent drop from the year before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, properties on Crosby Street are selling well above market average. For instance, a 2,678-square-foot second-floor apartment in the six-unit Bayard House at 76 Crosby went quickly into contract this month for $4.35 million, or $1,624 per square foot (the third-quarter median was $1,012).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And a four-bedroom duplex at 55 Crosby is on the market for $5.8 million. It offers 25-foot ceilings and the fact that the architect Frank Gehry once owned it. On the other hand, the 6,000-square-foot penthouse reconfigured into a flaming, soaring rock 'n' roll vision by the singer Lenny Kravitz and his designer, Benjamin Noriega-Ortiz, at 30 Crosby has languished on the market at $14.9 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the rest of SoHo has changed drastically, even in recent years, Crosby Street has resisted commercial transformation. Peter Hoffman, who opened the restaurant Savoy in 1990 -- arriving in the neighborhood long before Balthazar and with a then-idiosyncratic farm-to-fork notion -- remembers a different time and place. ''The block between Prince and Houston in the early '90s -- there was a lot of crack getting smoked there,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many years, his light on the corner of the dark street was a beacon. Now, of course, there's the MoMA Design Store opposite. And just a block down, a black GMC Yukon idles outside the set-back entrance to the Crosby Street Hotel, where rates start at $495 a night. Construction on the 270-room Mondrian Hotel (scheduled to open early this year) -- which will rise above downtown Manhattan from 150 Lafayette Street, the thoroughfare that runs parallel, to the east -- may be a harbinger of change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for now, Crosby remains a little residential secret, sandwiched between commercial boulevards. ''It's very quiet,'' Mr. Kornfeld said. ''Unless it gets rowdy at N.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article last Sunday about couples who buy homes together before getting married misstated the income limits of the federal first-time home buyer tax credit. For purchases after Nov. 6, 2009, the full credit is available to married couples filing joint returns with modified adjusted gross incomes of up to $225,000, not $150,000; and for individuals with incomes of up to $125,000, not $75,000. (The lower numbers were the limits for purchases before Nov. 6.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The article also misstated whether the tax credit can be divided between unmarried buyers. Indeed it can, if both buyers qualify for the credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Sun Jan 10 2010</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CHUCK HABERSTROH and Jacque Horelik went to high school together in Westport, Conn., but they did not know each other then. They met by chance during college, when she visited a mutual friend at Lehigh University, where he was a student. A few years later they crossed paths back home in Westport and went on a date to a cool pub and restaurant. Things were a bit on and off for a while, but then they began to get serious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He lived in a house in nearby Norwalk with a bunch of male buddies; she moved to the place next door with her sister and a couple of friends. She started spending all of her time at his place, so she ditched her room and moved in with him. A few months later, they signed a lease on a small apartment of their own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was in his late 20s, she was two years younger. They had been together for two years. They made each other laugh, they liked each other's friends, they loved each other's company. And so they knew -- as everyone seemed to be telling them -- that it was time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To buy real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two distinct forms of desire -- the carnal type and the kind that involves granite countertops -- have been known to intermingle, but perhaps never more so than now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York and its environs have always been places where real estate can drive relationships, for better or for worse (think of the marriages that have lingered for far too long because neither spouse can afford to move out of the Classic 6). But the peculiarities of the housing market today are leading more couples to ponder the question, ''Should we buy?'' before they settle the question, ''Should we commit?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Haberstroh, now 30 and a vice president of CastleKeep Investment Advisors in Westport, said the market dictated which question he and Ms. Horelik tackled first.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When the market started to turn in the buyer's favor,'' he said, ''we decided we had to take advantage of that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Oct. 30, they closed on a three-bedroom Cape Cod-style cottage in Fairfield, Conn., with hardwood floors, a front porch and a back deck on a pretty corner lot. They got it for $430,000, $29,000 less than the asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They had been assuming for a while that one day they would, probably, get married, but for one reason or another the engagement had not happened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My whole thing was with this market, get the house -- the one you want and love -- first,'' Mr. Haberstroh said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That wasn't entirely her whole thing. ''I was itching to get engaged before we bought the house,'' said Ms. Horelik, 28, a teacher who works with special education students. ''Chuck definitely felt the pressure from me and both of our families.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, she added, ''now I see why he wanted to wait. He saw the prices and rates were dropping and we realized we may never see such a buyer-friendly environment again.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other couples are also finding it difficult to resist the allure of startlingly low mortgage rates, fallen prices that may be about to turn up again and expiring tax breaks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are just so many things you can lose out on'' if you wait, said Elaine Matthews, 27, an actress and dancer who is in contract to buy a condominium in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, with her boyfriend of 16 months, Sean MacLaughlin. They hope to close on the property -- a brand-new 1,200-square-foot ground-floor duplex with a backyard, a deck and a white picket fence -- at the end of February or the beginning of March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Matthews and Mr. MacLaughlin, a 31-year-old actor, met while performing with the touring company of ''The Phantom of the Opera,''and have spent most of their relationship on the road, living in hotels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''New York rents are very high and you never see that money again,'' Ms. Matthews said. She went on to list the benefits of buying: ''We got a great mortgage rate, 4.75,'' she said. In addition, owners of units in new developments in New York City can take advantage of a program that phases in property taxes over a period of 10 years. And then there's the federal tax credit for first-time home buyers, to expire on April 30, 2010, which will provide several thousand dollars in income tax relief.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We will eventually get engaged and get married,'' Ms. Matthews added. ''We're kind of like, let's get this apartment now, then let's make it official.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. MacLaughlin said: ''We were talking about getting married and I said, 'Wait a minute, if we just put off the ring, we'll get the apartment first.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At $522,000, the apartment costs a good deal more than most rings, but Ms. Matthews said the price was about $60,000 less than what a similar unit in a complex by the same developer went for two years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the most compelling forces motivating many couples right now is the first-time home buyer tax credit, which offers federal income tax relief equal to 10 percent of the purchase price of a home -- capped at $8,000 -- for couples earning less than $150,000 and individuals earning less than $75,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pete Flint, the chief executive of Trulia, a real estate search engine, points out that people who have never bought a home make up a demographic tending toward the young and unmarried. The credit, a part of the broad economic stimulus package enacted into law last year, was to expire last November, but Congress extended it until the end of April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That deadline is lighting a fire under some couples in the serious, or almost-serious, stages of a relationship. They worry that if they don't act now, they may squander the best property-buying opportunity they will have for a while. There are also signs (or at least a feeling in the air) that the housing market could be picking up (including word that this may be a good year for Wall Street bonuses).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Flint said that trulia.com had received numerous e-mail messages from unmarried couples asking about the logistics -- and wisdom -- of buying a home together. Many of the queries are about the first-time home buyer tax credit and how or whether it can be divided between people whose marital status doesn't allow them to jointly file a tax return.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(The answer from the Internal Revenue Service: only one of the two people can claim the tax break if they are unmarried at the time of the sale. It cannot be divided, even if the couple marry later in the year.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trulia posts such questions on a message board called Trulia Voices, and real estate professionals often chime in with answers. One of the notes on the board contained the following cautionary tale from a couple who split up, rather than marry, six months after buying a new house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One person in the pair had provided a 10 percent cash down payment on the home; the other borrowed 10 percent; and they both signed a mortgage for the remaining 80 percent. Once they decided to break up, their only recourse seemed to be to try and sell the house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Yet,'' the e-mail post says, ''only being six months into the house it would be difficult to break even (right?). He is in no financial position to take on the home himself and I would be strapped if I did.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate lawyers say that there are more complications for unmarried property owners who part ways than there are for married property owners who divorce -- and a less clear process for resolving them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''By default, our laws are suited for married couples acquiring assets,'' says Luigi Rosabianca, a real estate lawyer in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under New York State law, he explains, a husband and wife are considered ''tenants by the entirety'' when they buy property. That ensures, among other things, that the property will automatically transfer to the surviving spouse if one person dies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you are not married, you have to fill in the blanks,'' Mr. Rosabianca said. Toward that end, he recommends that unmarried couples consider signing what amounts to a pre-prenuptial -- legal agreements specifying the unknowns, including ''who contributes what percentage of the expenses, mortgage, taxes, common charges, utilities.'' He added, ''You also have to account for capital gains -- what percentage goes to whom.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there can be other issues. ''Say this house is close to your mother,'' Mr. Rosabianca said. It may be wise to sign an agreement saying, ''If we break up, you have to buy me out, because I don't want to live near your mother.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Couldn't that be a problem for a married couple going through a divorce as well?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With a married couple that would probably be handled with the divorce,'' he said. With an unmarried couple ''it's almost more prudent to be proactive in addressing these concerns.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Victor Bell III and Temiko Clifton, both 28, became engaged in May, but their romantic progression has also been influenced by the pull of real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At about the same time they were committing to each other, they were racing to take advantage of the first-time buyer tax credit. They made several offers on properties that fell through. But recently their offer was accepted for a three-bedroom, one-bath house with a renovated kitchen in Valley Stream, N.Y.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, before they select a date for their wedding, they need to know how large an event they will be able to afford. ''We want to see how much our mortgage is going to cost us first,'' Mr. Bell said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And for Mr. Haberstroh and Ms. Horelik, both the real estate and the relationship have now fallen into place, to the delight of Ms. Horelik's family, who are of the wedding-before-house school.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first night they slept in their new home, they got engaged. They are hoping for a late-summer 2010 wedding, but have not set the date.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Between moving in and outfitting the house,'' Mr. Haberstroh said, ''we've had a hard time finding time to really make progress on that front.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Look Before You Leap</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE body of law governing property rights of unmarried partners is nowhere near as well defined as that covering the rights of married couples. To help prevent expensive and time-consuming disputes in the future, here are some questions unmarried couples should ask their lawyers and financial advisers before buying property:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How will the title to the property be held -- joint tenants, tenants in common or living trust?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Should both our names be on the mortgage?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Should we enter into a legal ''partnership agreement'' before buying the property?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How does domestic partner registration in our state affect property ownership?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Should each of us keep records of our individual payments -- and their proportion of the total -- toward the mortgage, utilities, taxes and other expenses related to the property?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If we broke up, how easily could the property be divided?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If one of us died, how easily could the property be distributed?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEWINGTON</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SITUATED just below the city of Hartford, the midsized community of Newington lacks the pristinely kept historic districts, scenic rivers and executive neighborhoods prized by many of its suburban neighbors. What it has to offer is more practical: easy access to major highways, lots of modest houses on equally modest lots and a competitive property tax rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The biggest word you can use to describe Newington is 'comfortable,' '' said Cathleen Hall, who has lived and sold homes here for 26 years, most recently as an agent with Prudential Connecticut. ''No pretension.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It turns out, however, that in an otherwise hobbled housing market, being good enough can be very good. Last month Amy Bergquist, an agent with William Raveis who tracks sales data on her blog, Greater Hartford Real Estate, singled out Newington as the only one of 17 area towns that has actually cycled back into a seller's market for single-family homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That means that at the current pace of sales, homes now on the market in Newington can be expected to sell within three months, an enviable condition at a time when some towns are still saddled with a year's worth of inventory -- or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newington has maintained its solitary status for six consecutive months, long enough to cause Ms. Bergquist to remark to her readers, ''Man, I wish I had a house in Newington to sell.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By comparison, Connecticut Multiple Listing Service data indicated that 11 other area towns are in a neutral market (three to six months of inventory). Five, including the pricey communities of Avon and Farmington, are still in a buyers' market, meaning that the abundance of homes for sale gives buyers the upper hand in negotiations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview, Ms. Bergquist ticked off a number of reasons for the Newington anomaly: highway accessibility, a ''decent'' school system and ''every big-box store you could imagine.'' She and other agents agreed, however, that if they had to name the single most significant reason for the healthier sales pace, they would pick price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newington stands out from competing communities in that the majority of its single-family homes are priced below $300,000 -- the sweet spot for the first-time buyers lured into the market by low mortgage rates and the federal housing tax credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Newington is representative of Middle America,'' said Mayor Jeff Wright, who grew up in town and bought his first property here in 1997. ''We don't have a lot of people that are ultrawealthy, and we don't have a lot of people who are ultrapoor.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a comparison, take, for example, West Hartford, Newington's neighbor to the north. The price range for the 170 or so single-family houses on the market there recently stretched from a low of $107,000 up to $2.45 million, Evan L. Berman said, an owner of ERA Broder Group. The median list price was $329,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price range across the 70 or so houses listed in Newington was far more compressed: $104,000 to $569,000, with a median of $249,900.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Newington has more reasonably priced homes, more consistently affordable homes,'' Mr. Berman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not that prices in Newington have declined significantly over the past three years; Ms. Hall estimated a maximum drop-off of 12 percent. But then again Newington, true to its middle-of-the-road status, had never experienced the steep increases of other towns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was dictated, at least in part, by the community's housing stock. With roughly 12,000 households squeezed into its 13 square miles, Newington is more densely developed than most surrounding towns: only 8 percent of its land remains undeveloped. Most streets are lined with pre-1980 homes built on fairly small, closely spaced lots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Judging from the properties on the market, houses larger than 2,000 square feet are still the exception. More typical are the three-bedroom ranch on a half acre with a two-car garage listed for $249,900; or the three-bedroom one-bath Cape on a quarter acre for $199,000, a price that acknowledges the need for updates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fixer-uppers listed earlier this year at even lower prices prompted bidding wars between investors who saw turnaround potential in the homes, and buyers who wanted to live in them, Ms. Hall said. She received 12 offers for a house that needed a kitchen, a bathtub and a furnace. Originally listed for $129,900, the house eventually sold for $141,000, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condominium and apartment complexes are spread throughout the neighborhoods -- which, as Ms. Hall pointed out, further stabilizes the market by making it easier for residents to move up or scale back without leaving town.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such was the case with Mayor Wright and his wife, Marina, who started out in a three-bedroom condo in Newington before moving up to a single-family home in his childhood neighborhood. He certainly hadn't planned on living next door to his parents, but while at their house for dinner one night, Mr. Wright learned that their neighbor was about to list his house. He and his wife went next door to take a look. They made up their minds on the spot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We ended up buying it right there, over a homemade glass of wine,'' Mr. Wright said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the hardiest members of New York City's real estate industry acknowledge that 2009 was a year of startling casualties. After the steady implosions of 2008, last year was practically a freefall, as the residential market, which had often been inflated by Wall Street bonuses, started to absorb the financial blows when bankers stopped buying up pricey apartments. Troubles have only just begun for developers and skyscraper owners as they struggle to finish projects that were planned in more prosperous times; in some cases, the owners may choose simply to abandon them. A roundup of the highs and lows:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1 HIGHEST-PRICED APARTMENT TO SELL</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A $40 million co-op at 820 Fifth Avenue, bought by Kenneth C. Griffin, the hedge fund mogul and founder of the <span class="companylink">Citadel Investment Group</span>. Whether Mr. Griffin got a bargain on the apartment, which appeared never to have been listed on the open market, is up for debate: He paid less than the city's two highest buyers of 2008, who each spent $48 million on apartments. But it was still twice the price of a gigantic Midtown apartment building; the debt on the entire Sheffield57 building went for a mere $20 million in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2 MEMORABLE MOMENT IN THE LUXURY MARKET</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A federal marshal's turn as a salesman, touting the ''understated elegance'' of Bernard L. Madoff's Montauk home in a video tour of the property created for the press before it went on the market in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The very premise led Jonathan Miller, president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel, to write in his blog, ''My temples pulsate every time I think of it,'' adding, ''Could you ever imagine a U.S. marshal uttering those words while showing a house (carrying a weapon, I assume?).''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the efforts of the marshal, Roland Ubaldo, before the Montauk property was handed off to <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, enjoyed mixed success. The Montauk house fetched its $8.75 million asking price and then some, selling for $9.4 million. But there still aren't any takers for the Manhattan apartment at 133 East 64th Street, even after a $1 million price cut. And Mr. Ubaldo refuses to say whether he was, in fact, armed while in the spotlight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3 FORECLOSURES BY THE NUMBERSJamaica, Queens, was by far the hardest-hit neighborhood, with 1,000 properties currently in foreclosure, according to Propertyshark.com. Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, was second with 100 foreclosures, while Harlem, the Manhattan neighborhood with the most foreclosures, had 36.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4 TUMBLE FROM THE TOP</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through the boom, Kent Swig was a golden boy of real estate. His family laid claim to much of the San Francisco skyline, and he married into a New York real estate fortune with his vows to Harry Macklowe's daughter, Elizabeth. His empire here grew to include the purchase and development of more than $3 billion in real estate since 2001, largely in the financial district. He also has ownership stakes in the real estate brokerages Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead, along with an appraisal firm and a construction company. But in the past 12 months, he has faced foreclosure on his business properties, been whacked with an ice bucket by his business partner during a dispute, and said publicly that he may file for personal bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">5 OLD ICON BROUGHT LOWThe Apthorp, built by the Astors a century ago at 79th Street and Broadway, had so many troubles that Curbed.com labeled updates on the building ''As the Apthorp Turns.'' Since apartments in the stately old building shifted from rentals to condominiums in 2008, the building has faced the threat of foreclosure, battles among owners who could not even agree to mediation, and renovation hassles for its remaining tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">6 VETERAN LISTING</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A penthouse in Trump Park Avenue has been on the market for more than 1,500 days, according to Streeteasy.com. The unit, encompassing the 23rd floor, was originally listed on Nov. 1, 2005, for $18.9 million. Mr. Trump raised the price to $21.8 million in January 2008, then took it off the market in early March 2008, relisting it later that month for $31.1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">7 DEVELOPMENT, PAUSED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Community Board 1 in Brooklyn, which includes trendy Williamsburg and Greenpoint, has 59 stalled construction sites within its boundaries. That's a multiple more than any other Brooklyn district and more than a tenth of the 522 abandoned sites in the entire city. On the bright side of the slowdown, the number of construction-related fatalities shrank to three in 2009, compared with 19 in 2008, 12 in 2007 and 18 in 2006, according to the Department of Buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">8 NOTABLE OPENINGS AND CLOSINGS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Manhattan bid adieu to expensive restaurants like La Goulue, Cafe des Artistes and Tavern on the Green, the Shake Shack became a veritable chain. Fortunoff closed its doors, and <span class="companylink">J. C. Penney</span> made its Manhattan entree. Over all, the retail vacancy rate more than doubled compared with the year before, to 6.8 percent, according to the real estate firm Marcus &amp;Millichap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">9 HYPED, THEN FLOPPEDThe Solaria was marketed as a Riverdale condo offering residents close proximity to both Manhattan and the pastoral pleasures of, say, horseback riding. It featured Toto toilets, granite countertops and a rooftop observatory. But by November 2009 the apartments had been up for sale for three years and had attracted only 10 buyers. An attempt to auction off the remaining 54 units yielded only 21 more deals in contract, according to Real Estate Disposition, which handled the auction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">10 REFRESHING GLIMPSE BEHIND THE SCENES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In bride-to-be mode, Ivanka Trump registered at <span class="companylink">Williams-Sonoma</span> for a $34 bundt cake pan and proclaimed on Twitter how much she liked to cook. Maybe more real estate moguls will start dining in this year.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama administration's $75 billion program to protect homeowners from foreclosure has been widely pronounced a disappointment, and some economists and real estate experts now contend it has done more harm than good.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since President Obama announced the program in February, it has lowered mortgage payments on a trial basis for hundreds of thousands of people but has largely failed to provide permanent relief. Critics increasingly argue that the program, Making Home Affordable, has raised false hopes among people who simply cannot afford their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, desperate homeowners have sent payments to banks in often-futile efforts to keep their homes, which some see as wasting dollars they could have saved in preparation for moving to cheaper rental residences. Some borrowers have seen their credit tarnished while falsely assuming that loan modifications involved no negative reports to credit agencies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some experts argue the program has impeded economic recovery by delaying a wrenching yet cleansing process through which borrowers give up unaffordable homes and banks fully reckon with their disastrous bets on real estate, enabling money to flow more freely through the financial system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The choice we appear to be making is trying to modify our way out of this, which has the effect of lengthening the crisis,'' said Kevin Katari, managing member of Watershed Asset Management, a San Francisco-based hedge fund. ''We have simply slowed the foreclosure pipeline, with people staying in houses they are ultimately not going to be able to afford anyway.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Katari contends that banks have been using temporary loan modifications under the Obama plan as justification to avoid an honest accounting of the mortgage losses still on their books. Only after banks are forced to acknowledge losses and the real estate market absorbs a now pent-up surge of foreclosed properties will housing prices drop to levels at which enough Americans can afford to buy, he argues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Then the carpenters can go back to work,'' Mr. Katari said. ''The roofers can go back to work, and we start building housing again. If this drips out over the next few years, that whole sector of the economy isn't going to recover.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Treasury Department publicly maintains that its program is on track. ''The program is meeting its intended goal of providing immediate relief to homeowners across the country,'' a department spokeswoman, Meg Reilly, wrote in an e-mail message.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But behind the scenes, Treasury officials appear to have concluded that growing numbers of delinquent borrowers simply lack enough income to afford their homes and must be eased out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late November, with scant public disclosure, the Treasury Department started the Foreclosure Alternatives Program, through which it will encourage arrangements that result in distressed borrowers surrendering their homes. The program will pay incentives to mortgage companies that allow homeowners to sell properties for less than they owe on their mortgages -- short sales, in real estate parlance. The government will also pay incentives to mortgage companies that allow delinquent borrowers to hand over their deeds in lieu of foreclosing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Reilly, the Treasury spokeswoman, said the foreclosure alternatives program did not represent a new policy. ''We have said from the start that modifications will not be the solution for all homeowners and will not solve the housing crisis alone,'' Ms. Reilly said by e-mail. ''This has always been a multi-pronged effort.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever the merits of its plans, the administration has clearly failed to reverse the foreclosure crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2008, more than 1.7 million homes were ''lost'' through foreclosures, short sales or deeds in lieu of foreclosure, according to Moody'sEconomy.com. Last year, more than two million homes were lost, and Economy.com expects that this year's number will swell to 2.4 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't think there's any way for Treasury to tweak their plan, or to cajole, pressure or entice servicers to do more to address the crisis,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com. ''For some folks, it is doing more harm than good, because ultimately, at the end of the day, they are going back into the foreclosure morass.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Zandi argues that the administration needs a new initiative that attacks a primary source of foreclosures: the roughly 15 million American homeowners who are underwater, meaning they owe the bank more than their home is worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Increasingly, such borrowers are inclined to walk away and accept foreclosure, rather than continuing to make payments on properties in which they own no equity. A paper by researchers at the Amherst Securities Group suggests that being underwater ''is a far more important predictor of defaults than unemployment.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From its inception, the Obama plan has drawn criticism for failing to compel banks to write down the size of outstanding mortgage balances, which would restore equity for underwater borrowers, giving them greater incentive to make payments. A vast majority of modifications merely decrease monthly payments by lowering the interest rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Zandi proposes that the Treasury Department push banks to write down some loan balances by reimbursing the companies for their losses. He pointedly rejects the notion that government ought to get out of the way and let foreclosures work their way through the market, saying that course risks a surge of foreclosures and declining house prices that could pull the economy back into recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We want to overwhelm this problem,'' he said. ''If we do go back into recession, it will be very difficult to get out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the current program, the government provides cash incentives to mortgage companies that lower monthly payments for borrowers facing hardships. The Treasury Department set a goal of three to four million permanent loan modifications by 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's overly optimistic at this stage,'' said Richard H. Neiman, the superintendent of banks for New York State and an appointee to the Congressional Oversight Panel, a body created to keep tabs on taxpayer bailout funds. ''There's a great deal of frustration and disappointment.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of mid-December, some 759,000 homeowners had received loan modifications on a trial basis typically lasting three to five months. But only about 31,000 had received permanent modifications -- a step that requires borrowers to make timely trial payments and submit paperwork verifying their financial situation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government has pressured mortgage companies to move faster. Still, it argues that trial modifications are themselves a considerable help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Almost three-quarters of a million Americans now are benefiting from modification programs that reduce their monthly payments dramatically, on average $550 a month,'' Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said last month at a hearing before the Congressional Oversight Panel. ''That is a meaningful amount of support.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But mortgage experts and lawyers who represent borrowers facing foreclosure argue that recipients of trial loan modifications often wind up worse off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Lakeland, Fla., Jaimie S. Smith, 29, called her mortgage company, then <span class="companylink">Washington Mutual</span>, in October 2008, when she realized she would get a smaller bonus from her employer, a furniture company, threatening her ability to continue the $1,250 monthly mortgage payments on her three-bedroom house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April, Chase, which had taken over <span class="companylink">Washington Mutual</span>, lowered her payment to $1,033.62 in a trial that was supposed to last three months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Smith made all three payments on time and submitted required documents, Chase confirms. She called the bank almost weekly to inquire about a permanent loan modification. Each time, she says, Chase told her to continue making trial payments and await word on a permanent modification.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, in October, a startling legal notice arrived in the mail: Chase had foreclosed on her house and sold it at auction for $100. (The purchaser? Chase.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I cried,'' she said. ''I was hysterical. I bawled my eyes out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later that week came another letter from Chase: ''Congratulations on qualifying for a Making Home Affordable loan modification!''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Ms. Smith frantically called the bank to try to overturn the sale, she was told that the house was no longer hers. Chase would not tell her how long she could remain there, she says. She feared the sheriff would show up at her door with eviction papers, or that she would return home to find her belongings piled on the curb. So Ms. Smith anxiously set about looking for a new place to live.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She had been planning to continue an online graduate school program in supply chain management, and she had about $4,000 in borrowed funds to pay tuition. She scrapped her studies and used the money to pay the security deposit and first month's rent on an apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later, she hired a lawyer, who is seeking compensation from Chase. A judge later vacated the sale. Chase is still offering to make her loan modification permanent, but Ms. Smith has already moved out and is conflicted about what to do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I could have just walked away,'' said Ms. Smith. ''If they had said, 'We can't work with you,' I'd have said: 'What are my options? Short sale?' None of this would have happened. God knows, I never would have wanted to go through this. I'd still be in grad school. I would not have paid all that money to them. I could have saved that money.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Chase spokeswoman, Christine Holevas, confirmed that the bank mistakenly foreclosed on Ms. Smith's house and sold it at the same time it was extending the loan modification offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There was a systems glitch,'' Ms. Holevas said. ''We are sorry that an error happened. We're trying very hard to do what we can to keep folks in their homes. We are dealing with many, many individuals.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many borrowers complain they were told by mortgage companies their credit would not be damaged by accepting a loan modification, only to discover otherwise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a telephone conference with reporters, Jack Schakett, <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>'s credit loss mitigation executive, confirmed that even borrowers who were current before agreeing to loan modifications and who then made timely payments were reported to credit rating agencies as making only partial payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest source of concern remains the growing numbers of underwater borrowers -- now about one-third of all American homeowners with mortgages, according to Economy.com. The Obama administration clearly grasped the threat as it created its program, yet opted not to focus on writing down loan balances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a conscious choice we made, not to start with principal reduction,'' Mr. Geithner told the Congressional Oversight Panel. ''We thought it would be dramatically more expensive for the American taxpayer, harder to justify, create much greater risk of unfairness.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Geithner's explanation did not satisfy the panel's chairwoman, Elizabeth Warren.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Are we creating a program in which we're talking about potentially spending $75 billion to try to modify people into mortgages that will reduce the number of foreclosures in the short term, but just kick the can down the road?'' she asked, raising the prospect ''that we'll be looking at an economy with elevated mortgage foreclosures not just for a year or two, but for many years. How do you deal with that problem, Mr. Secretary?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A good question, Mr. Geithner conceded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What to do about it,'' he said. ''That's a hard thing.''</p>

</div><div class="author">By LESLIE KAUFMAN </div><div>1056 words</div><div>1 January 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the Florida Everglades to the bluffs overlooking the Deschutes River in Oregon, conservationists are snapping up prime property for preservation, often at a fraction of what the asking price was at the real estate market's height.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, the threatened bog turtle got a reprieve when conservationists scooped up 166 acres of marshland in Frankford Township in northern New Jersey, where developers had planned to build luxury homes. Hours later, city officials and environmentalists in Boise, Idaho, were rejoicing as they closed a deal to protect 1,300 acres of wooded foothills beloved by local hikers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The victories reveal a green lining of sorts in a credit crisis that has depressed real estate prices, prompted foreclosures and derailed development projects across the nation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The purchases by conservationists and state and local governments assure that thousands of acres will be put aside in perpetuity for parks, watershed protection or simply preservation of open space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are getting a second bite at properties that never should have been developed in the first place,'' said Will Rogers, president of the Trust for Public Land, a national nonprofit group that buys land for preservation. ''We are working on dozens of these deals across the country, and I know other land trusts are as well.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the real estate bubble burst in 2008, it was only in the last 6 to 12 months that many developers and banks became desperate enough to slash prices deeply enough for the trusts, Mr. Rogers and several other conservationists said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suki Molina, vice president of the Foothills Conservation Advisory Committee, which joined with the City of Boise in spending $10 million to preserve open space, said her group noticed a change in the way local landowners were approaching the committee early this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The prices were lower,'' Ms. Molina said, ''but what has really changed is the attitude of the developers -- they want to get out. Before this year, they would call, say they had a great piece of land and wanted top dollar. Now, they just want to sell.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what seemed like dream property forever out of their reach -- including waterfront sites near cities or land bordering untouchable parks -- is suddenly attainable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Little Egg Harbor, N.J., north of Atlantic City, Mr. Rogers's group is buying 46 acres covered with pine scrub and marshes for $3.5 million. A year ago, it was priced at $6.2 million after its developer dropped plans for 73 single-family homes as part of a development called the Landings. Now it will become part of the adjacent Edwin Forsythe National Wildlife Refuge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, officials in New York City announced on Tuesday that a park would be created on a site in Jamaica Bay, Queens, where 21 two-story attached houses with views of water had been planned only a year ago. The bay is polluted yet nutrient-rich, and buffering wetlands are needed there for bird and wildlife protection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in Portland, Ore., 27 acres of grassy and wooded hills at the city's southeastern end that were to become a residential subdivision are now open for hiking, picnicking and dog walking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The land has been added to a city park called Clatsop Butte. It sold for $4.4 million when the market collapsed, down from its estimated worth of $5 million a few months earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many cases, the preservation deals are negotiated with banks that have foreclosed on property and are eager to get bad assets off the books.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bill Eshenbaugh, a real estate broker in Florida who goes by the promotional moniker the Dirt Dog, said the trusts' endowments often allowed them to pay cash, which banks now require in such cases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2009, ''we did over $60 million in land deals, and not one penny financed,'' Mr. Eshenbaugh said. ''It was all cash. The trusts can come up with the cash, and cash is what it's all about.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, while the trusts see more opportunities, they have also been taking in fewer donations since the economic downturn. Local and state governments enlisted to cover part of a purchase or to maintain donated land are usually struggling as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keith Fountain, director of land acquisition for the Florida chapter of the nonprofit Nature Conservancy, which focuses on preserving large swaths of undeveloped land to protect ecosystems, said the past year's offerings were the best in the 17 years he had pursued properties, among them 500,000 acres that protect rivers feeding the Everglades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this year, for the first time in two decades, shortfalls led the State of Florida not to budget its annual $300 million for land conservation. Previously, the conservancy had put together deals and the state put up the cash. As a result, Mr. Fountain said, the conservancy has had to pass up some gems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When a preservation purchase succeeds, not every municipality is necessarily happy. Towns may mourn the loss of development that could have generated revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials in Albemarle County, Va., for example, are frustrated that Forest Lodge L.L.C., a local developer that had permits to build 3,100 houses and apartments on 800 acres of meadows and forest, gave that land and 400 acres more to the state for a park this week in return for tax credits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supervisors had anticipated $38 million in commitments for public improvements from Forest Lodge. What is more, said Dennis Rooker, a member of the board of supervisors, the county spent more than $200,000 in staff time to hammer out that plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the long run, said Mr. Rogers of the Trust for Public Land, even developers recognize that newly protected lands can have a positive effect on real estate prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Developers have long seen that conserved land next to a development adds value,'' he said. ''There are genuine economic benefits for everyone that will come out of this.''</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Square Feet: Hints the Worst May Be Over for Office Space in New Jersey</span>
</div><div class="author">By ANTOINETTE MARTIN   </div><div>1141 words</div><div>30 December 2009</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market for office space in New Jersey took a beating in 2009. The vacancy rate swelled to about 22 percent. Rents sank by at least $1 a square foot. And despite its traditional strength as a white-collar job base, the state lost office jobs at a faster clip than the nation at large.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question now seems to be whether some faint signs of life will continue in the new year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some office market specialists said that rental rates had fallen so much and vacancy rates had risen so much that more deals were being struck. Craig Eisenhardt, a leasing specialist with <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>, called the situation a ''flicker of an uptick.'' Based on lease deals from Oct. 1 through the first half of December, he said, ''it looks like we are ending the year with a 21.5 percent vacancy rate. That's down from 22 percent in the third quarter.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daniel Loughlin, the managing director for another large commercial real estate company, <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>, agreed. His company predicts an additional 150,000 square feet will be occupied in the final quarter compared with the previous quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the size of the total market, Mr. Loughlin said, such a gain is minimal. And agreements are increasing primarily because of renewals at renegotiated prices, he added. ''But it is still the first time the vacancy rate has declined in seven quarters,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gualberto Medina, a former state secretary of commerce who heads the New Jersey office of the commercial real estate company Cushman &amp; Wakefield, cited a survey performed last fall indicating that half of the top 500 companies in New Jersey had laid off employees because of the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The same survey, produced by researchers at Rutgers University who interviewed senior executives during the final three months of the year, showed that 76 percent of companies expected to reduce, or continue reducing, costs in 2010, and 31 percent anticipated more layoffs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Medina said, however, that the numbers might be misleading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have to bear in mind that these executives were talking about their intentions while still in a period of severe economic uncertainty,'' he said. ''Those were foxhole predictions. Personally, I see some positive indicators at this point -- and a trend line that is good.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several of the larger office landlords in northern New Jersey reported clear signs of improvement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SK Properties, based in Bridgewater, completed more leases, in terms of dollars and volume, this year than it did in 2007 and 2008 combined, according to its chief executive, Justin J. Gingeleskie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One main factor was the offer we made to all tenants in our portfolio'' of 1.3 million square feet of office properties, Mr. Gingeleskie said. ''We will hold your rent where it is now, with one month free, for a three-year extension; many took advantage of that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Gingeleskie also pointed to a ''star performer'' in a growing field, the AMCS Corporation, which does engineering for processing and power plants. It tripled its space and moved to a larger building in Bedminster, from Bridgewater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parsippany, in Morris County, was once a stronghold for Fortune 500 companies. The vacancy rate there rose to 25 percent this year. But a new 100,000-square-foot structure, built speculatively, was fully leased to the law firm <span class="companylink">Day Pitney</span>, in a deal announced in late October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We feel that legal services is one of few areas where some expansion is occurring,'' said Remy deVarenne, senior vice president of <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>'s office in the state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. deVarenne and other market specialists also pointed to ''small pharma'' and medical research centers as industries that will take up some of the slack left by the big pharmaceutical companies that have reduced their presence in New Jersey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mergers of pharmaceutical giants -- <span class="companylink">Pfizer</span> with <span class="companylink">Wyeth</span>, and Merck with <span class="companylink">Schering-Plough</span> -- have created extensive office vacancies this year, with more disruption to come, said Jerry L. Barta of Alfred Sanzari Enterprises, a large office landlord in Bergen County.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Barta said <span class="companylink">PharmaNet</span>'s renewal of a 122,000-square-foot lease in the Princeton area was something of a positive sign for northern New Jersey, and he mentioned <span class="companylink">Otsuka America Pharmaceutical</span>'s new lease in West Windsor of 67,531 square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''New Jersey has lost jobs in the pharma and biotech industries in the last 18 months while other states have expanded,'' Mr. Barta said. ''The picture is definitely not pretty. But at least people now seem to be over the panic stage, and realize the world is not coming to an end, and they can actually get back to running their businesses and think in longer terms.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market for office space on the Hudson River waterfront is beginning a recovery, analysts say. Steven J. Pozycki, the chief executive of SJP Properties, was somewhat less sanguine. His company has an office tower under construction near Times Square in Manhattan, and it developed the Waterfront Corporate Center in Hoboken.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Manhattan is definitely on the comeback,'' Mr. Pozycki said. ''In New Jersey, where the office market has been lackluster for the past two years, we are seeing a slight pickup in the last quarter. The good news is we're not out of gas; the bad news is that it's only less bad than it was.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average asking rents this year sank below $25 a square foot for the first time since 2006, according to <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>. But in select submarkets, like the waterfront, Princeton and Newark, asking rents remain higher, around $30 a square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, Mr. deVarenne of <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span> added that in 44 percent of the deals made this year, companies did not even post asking rent, but rather ''worked with any potential tenants who came through the door,'' and offered bargain renewals, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Medina of Cushman &amp; Wakefield said the state's success in luring the <span class="companylink">Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation</span> was a ''potential omen of more good things to come.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company is expected to move 1,600 jobs from Wall Street to the Newport Office Center in Jersey City as of 2013, using tax-break incentives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pozycki, however, said the deal was atypical, since it was negotiated privately with the involvement of state officials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a glass-half-full type of situation,'' Mr. Medina said. ''As we continue to bump along the bottom and read tea leaves, many things become a matter of opinion, or attitude.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The practice of adorning New York real estate with major sculptures and other artwork stretches back at least as far as the 1930s. And even during today's tough economic times, the tradition is holding up. A number of major works of art have been installed in Midtown Manhattan in the last few months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October, for example, the Cohen Brothers Realty Corporation hung a 5,000-pound rotating sculpture from the ceiling of the atrium of 805 Third Avenue. On the other side of Manhattan, Silverstein Properties has bought a 29-foot-long playground sculpture by Tom Otterness for a new park adjacent to two of its apartment developments on West 42nd Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Lever House, the landmark International Style skyscraper by Gordon Bunshaft on Park Avenue, Aby Rosen, a principal of the building's owner, RFR Holding, has offered a quarterly show of art in the lobby and courtyard since 2003. And Park Tower Group recently agreed with Christie's to regularly display sculptures, which would later be auctioned, in the lobby and outdoor plaza of 535 Madison Avenue, a 37-story office building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Mary Ann Tighe, chief executive of the New York region of <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span> and a former deputy chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Arts, the Rockefellers were among the first New York real estate developers to use outdoor sculpture to beautify their buildings, installing works by Paul Manship at Rockefeller Center and by Jean Dubuffet at One Chase Manhattan Plaza.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such art ''has always been the mark of a Class A developer and property,'' she said. ''The Rockefellers set the pace in the 20th century.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a noteworthy Class A office building, art can ''provide the right image,'' said Lisa Austin, a Miami-based corporate art consultant. ''If you've got a really beautiful piece of architecture, the art can be the final exclamation point.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joel Straus, a corporate art consultant in Chicago, said that sculpture can also add a ''human element.'' He added, ''Often in New York, buildings are overscale; sculpture can bring the scale down.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Studies done by the Urban Land Institute, a real estate research group, show that ''amenities count, and these can include public art,'' said Maureen McAvey, executive vice president for the institute's initiatives group. ''This is true for both residential and office buildings.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's always the caveat that the art has to be well done and well thought through,'' she added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cohen Brothers spent $330,000 to acquire and install a 5,000-pound sculpture, made by Christian Eckhart from aluminum, steel and mirror stainless steel, that hangs above the three-story retail atrium at 805 Third Avenue as part of a $14 million renovation of the atrium and adjacent office lobby. There was no art in the atrium before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bronze Otterness playground sculpture -- a giant figure that is 30 feet wide, 29 feet long and 19 feet high, with slides going down one arm and both legs, and 25 six-inch figures crawling over its body -- sits in a new quarter-acre park behind One River Place and Silver Towers, two apartment buildings that occupy the south side of West 42nd Street between 11th and 12th Avenues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One River Place opened in 2006. The first stage of Silver Towers opened last June, and it is to be finished next spring. The park, which initially opened in 2000, was closed in 2006, when construction began on Silver Towers; it will reopen in the spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Larry A. Silverstein, chief executive of Silverstein Properties, said the price for the Otterness sculpture was seven figures, but he would not be more precise. Another person with knowledge of the purchase valued it at $1.2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michelle Isenberg, a corporate art consultant in Hollywood, said in an e-mail message that the Otterness work ''reinforces a brand. A building with a Tom Otterness playground piece is an intelligent, whimsical experience, which goes beyond the usual plastic, metal and wood equipment that might be presented as part of a family-friendly development.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Otterness said that the sculpture also ''marks the building. There will not be another building in New York with that in its footprint.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Installed in early December, the newest exhibit in the Lever House art collection was created by Richard Woods, who wrapped columns at the base of the building with plywood and covered them with strips of vinyl decorated with various textile patterns; the work was bought for $300,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rosen said he began the Lever House art collection to gain recognition for the building, on the west side of Park Avenue between 53rd and 54th Streets. ''Park Avenue is usually very corporate and boring,'' he said. ''We wanted to create an interesting environment for people to come and visit.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rosen owns the Lever House art collection with Alberto Mugrabi, an art dealer. Although Mr. Rosen said he had no commercial motive in starting the art collection, he stands to gain financially if works in the collection appreciate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the most unusual art display, from a business perspective, involves the arrangement recently struck by Park Tower Group and Christie's. The developer is exhibiting sculptures at 535 Madison Avenue, an Edward Larrabee Barnes building at the northeast corner of 54th Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The artwork, which Christie's will later auction, will change regularly and be on display in the building's newly renovated 2,250-square-foot lobby and its 4,870-square-foot plaza. No money is changing hands between Christie's and Park Tower Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sculpture ''is a great amenity for the building and for the public, with the plaza,'' said Alfred D. Bradshaw, executive vice president of Park Tower Group. He said the collaboration gives Christie's ''a different venue for displaying art.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Marc Porter, president of Christie's Americas, the Park Tower Group arrangement is Christie's first with a real estate developer. He said the auction house hoped to adopt the concept in other cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first exhibit, which ran for six weeks in the fall, Christie's lent Park Tower Group four sculptures by Francois-Xavier Lalanne and Claude Lalanne, including a bronze elk that was displayed in the plaza. The sculptures were auctioned this month in Christie's 20th-century decorative art and design sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of the sculptures that had been displayed were sold at prices above Christie's estimates. The elk, for example, had been estimated to sell for $100,000 to $150,000, and actually went for $266,500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Porter said Christie's arrangement with Park Tower Group let ''experienced buyers who had already been collectors see the art in a distinguished urban setting. It galvanized their interest in the objects.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One possible risk of the arrangement, Ms. Austin said, is potential ''damage to works of art owned by other people.'' Mr. Porter said Christie's would insure whatever art is displayed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some art and real estate professionals said they were not surprised by developers' continued interest in buying art, even during a recession. ''If the developers have money and are interested in art, they are going to spend it,'' Mr. Straus said. ''These guys do it because they have a passion for it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Art is ''depressed in price like every other asset class,'' said Frank Liantonio, executive vice president of capital markets at Cushman &amp; Wakefield. ''Smart developers are taking advantage of the market for art, and combining it with their real estate holdings to give their buildings a slight edge,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, he went on, ''one might say, in this economy, who cares about sculpture or art? Just give me the cheapest rent out there.''</p>

</div><div class="author">By DAVID STREITFELD  </div><div>1205 words</div><div>30 December 2009</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as the economy is finally beginning to strengthen, the real estate market is showing new signs of deterioration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices slipped in many cities in October, new figures show, despite low mortgage rates and a generous tax credit meant to spur sales. Now rates are starting to rise, making it harder for many buyers to afford a house, and the tax credit seems to be losing its capacity to lure them into the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The renewed worries about housing come against a backdrop of improvement in the broader economy. Surveys suggest consumers are growing more confident. That better mood probably helped improve holiday retail sales. The number of people joining the ranks of the jobless is dwindling, while the hiring of temporary workers is up, a traditional harbinger of recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, economic growth for the third quarter was more modest than originally reported; it was revised down to an annual rate of 2.2 percent from 2.8 percent. Many economists are fretting that housing could drag down the tenuous recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm worried. Everyone's worried,'' said Karl E. Case, the Wellesley College economist who helped design the housing index that provided fresh cause for alarm on Tuesday. ''If prices sink 15 percent from here, which is a possibility, and the 2008 and 2009 loans go bad, then we're back where we were before -- in a nightmare.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The figures released Tuesday showed that the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller home price index, a widely watched measure of housing markets in 20 metropolitan areas, rose 0.4 percent in October from the previous month on a seasonally adjusted basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the fifth consecutive month that prices were up, but the rate of increase has dropped sharply from the impressive gains of the summer. Prices in nine of the 20 cities were flat or down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some analysts see little cause for alarm. Dan Greenhaus of <span class="companylink">Miller Tabak</span> said that if prices fell ''a bit further'' it would sop up some of the excess inventory still weighing on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But others said that the Case-Shiller index showed an increase only because each report is an average of the preceding three months, meaning the strong August market was still a component of the October report. Another factor supporting the index is the seasonal adjustments, which tend to hide any weakness in the cooler months as the pace of home-buying slows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On an unadjusted basis, the index was flat. A different housing price index, compiled by the research firm LoanPerformance, fell 0.7 percent in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Case, who chided himself for his optimism over the summer, said he now believed ''the probability is very high of a serious double dip like 1982.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government has mounted an extensive and expensive effort to repair housing. While these actions undoubtedly staved off a total collapse, they are showing signs of fatigue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax credit for first-time buyers has been extended until next spring, but the urgency that buyers showed this summer, when they believed the credit was about to end, has drained away. The Federal Reserve has intervened in the market to push 30-year mortgage rates to the lowest level in decades, but says that program will end by March 31. Rates have already crept back above 5 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, the government-controlled mortgage giants, are tightening policies for loans in their portfolios. Lenders who sell their mortgages to Fannie and Freddie are becoming more skittish about extending credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Housing Administration, which has become an important part of the entry-level housing market, is expected to tighten its standards in the next few weeks. That would further crimp the pool of eligible buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Faramarz Moeen-Ziai of Bank of Commerce Mortgage in San Ramon, Calif., said many of his clients were struggling to complete deals. ''All this is adding to the downward pressure on prices,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Falling prices are in theory good for buyers. Some housing commentators say prices need to fall much further before houses will be truly affordable. But the drop over the last three years, however necessary, has caused tremendous damage to wallets and to the lubricant of commerce, confidence in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Falling prices have put as many as a quarter of mortgage holders under water, where the loan balance is greater than the amount the home would fetch. If they lose their jobs, they have little choice but to opt for foreclosure. In a vicious circle, every new foreclosure puts more pressure on the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neree Dastous, a 39-year-old firefighter in a San Francisco suburb, would like to move from his condominium into a three-bedroom house. But the condo is under water, so he cannot sell. Keeping it as a rental pushes his debt-to-income ratio above the new <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> guidelines. Interest rates are not helping, either.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Anything I can afford, I wouldn't want my kids to live in,'' Mr. Dastous said. ''I need prices to come down, but if they do the value of my condo goes down, too. It's very complicated.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Case, the Wellesley economist, said he was heartened by the minimal pace of housing starts by builders and the exuberant sales volume of existing houses. These two forces should ultimately clear the backlog in the market and prop up prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet for now, prices in many cities are weakening. ''There's no historical data for falling house prices'' on such a scale, he said. ''We don't know how this ends.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the Case-Shiller index has managed gains for the last several months, it is still down 7.3 percent from October 2008 and is off 29.5 percent from its peak. Some analysts predict prices will fall as much as an additional 10 percent. That could swiftly undermine consumers' frail confidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conference Board reported Tuesday that the consumer confidence index increased in December to 52.9 from a revised 50.6 in November. In February, when talk of another Depression was rife, the index was at 25.3.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Part of the reason people are turning more optimistic is a perception that the real estate market has turned,'' said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist for MFR. ''If that proves to be false, and we think it will be, it is going to come as a surprise to many.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dastous, the foiled buyer, is already deeply disappointed. He is exploring foreclosures and fixer-uppers, but has no confidence he and his family will be able to move any time soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing bloggers have given a name to this phenomenon: house arrest.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHEN a real estate broker suggested that Jessica and Jonathan Marron rent an apartment in the Brittany, the same Upper East Side building where Mrs. Marron had lived as a teenager and where her parents and a sister still live, Mrs. Marron knew she would have to let her husband make the call.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was fine with it, because I'm very close to my family,'' she said. ''But I said to him: 'Is this going to be too weird for you? Because I won't just be on the phone with them every day, they're going to be in the living room.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three closets in the front hall sold them both on the apartment. But it was only when Mr. Marron was very sure he wouldn't mind living so close to his in-laws that they signed the lease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They moved in 11 floors below Mrs. Marron's parents and sister Jamie Crumlish, in September. ''I figured it would be all right as long we're not on the same floor,'' Mr. Marron said. ''But it's really been more a blessing than anything else.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Marron's mother, Jo-Ann Crumlish, helps care for Ellie, the Marrons' 6-month-old daughter, three days a week, and her sister Jamie Crumlish frequently calls to ask for play dates with the baby. So on any given day, at least one of the Crumlishes can be found in the Marrons' living room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I see them every day, because someone is always exchanging the baby, either bringing her upstairs or bringing her back down,'' said Mrs. Marron, who is a schoolteacher, as are her husband and sister.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like other adult children who have moved into the building or the apartment complex where they grew up, Mrs. Marron says that being an elevator ride away from her parents can make privacy a precious thing. But, she said, proximity also has its pleasures, and it has been a relief to essentially live with the family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For some young families, it could even be that ''the new amenity or luxury isn't a lap pool, but having your brother next door and Mom and Dad available,'' as Darren Sukenik, a managing director at Prudential Douglas Elliman, says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The census does not track the adult children who live within an elevator ride of their parents, but Kathleen Gerson, a sociology professor at New York University, said she would not be surprised if the number were on the rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Young adults are increasingly more likely to be dual-career couples or single parents,'' she said, ''so they increasingly depend on caretaking networks, and family plays a very important role in that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Family networks have always existed in working-class neighborhoods, she added, but they are now appearing in middle-class neighborhoods as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the idea of several generations living in one building may seem novel, Dr. Gerson said, ''it's not that unusual, when you think of large apartment buildings being like a neighborhood in any other place -- it's just a vertical neighborhood. But once you make that mental leap, it's not as strange as it might seem.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People in small towns or smaller cities often live in the old neighborhood, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's kind of like the feeling where you grew up and your grandma lived around the corner and your aunt lived there, too,'' said Mrs. Crumlish, who was born in Brooklyn, where her family shared a brownstone in Bay Ridge with an aunt and uncle and their children. ''We've recreated some of that feeling here.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Crumlish and Mrs. Marron have keys to each other's apartments, but they are mindful of each other's privacy. Mrs. Crumlish goes to the Marron apartment only when she is expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My sister will sometimes come up unannounced,'' Jamie Crumlish said. ''But even though she has a key, she'll always ring the bell and wait for one of us to open the door.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the Crumlishes and the Marrons see one another daily because their schedules revolve around the baby, other families in similar living situations say they can go for days without running into their relatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michaela Gold has lived in the same Upper West Side building since she ''was a bride in the 1960s,'' and her daughter, Jessica Gold, has lived there nearly her entire life. Jessica Gold says that she and her mother speak to each other two or three times a day, but that they don't see each other regularly, in part because their building has two sides, with different entrances and elevator banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's never been like 'Everybody Loves Raymond,' '' said Jessica Gold, referring to the television show that uses suffocating family ties for comic effect: Raymond's parents live across the street from him and are constantly barging in unannounced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michaela Gold, who is an agent with Halstead Property, said that several families live in the building, which is on Riverside Drive and 90th Street. ''It sounds incestuous,'' she said, ''but nobody leaves this building unless they have to, and a lot of parents try to buy for their children when they're just starting out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is the kind of building where a child getting out of school with no one at home can rely on the doorman to know exactly which neighbor to call. ''It can kind of be like a kibbutz sometimes,'' Ms. Gold said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jessica Gold has two children, Luke, 13, and Olivia, 11. She and her now ex-husband moved in as a young couple, because she ''loved the familiarity and the sense of community here.'' Watching her children grow up in the same neighborhood and play on the same playgrounds where she played as a child has helped create wonderful memories, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said she had never contemplated leaving, because ''knowing that my mom is in the same building if I need her gives a single mother a huge sense of relief and comfort.'' In a cooking emergency, she can send one of the children over to Nana's for milk or flour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michaela Gold and her husband, William Slapin, are considering downsizing from the nine-room apartment with sweeping river views where Ms. Gold has lived since 1977.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When my granddaughter found out, she said, 'Promise me you won't leave me!' and it took me half an hour to reassure her that I was looking for something smaller in the building,'' Ms. Gold said. Her 3,000-square-foot apartment cost $125,000 in 1977; similar-sized apartments have sold recently for more than $6 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sukenik, the Prudential Douglas Elliman managing director, says that even in new developments, some families are seeking to create multigenerational homes. He recently sold three apartments at Superior Ink, a riverfront condominium in the West Village, to a family with togetherness in mind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two brothers bought apartments one floor apart, and their parents bought a third apartment as a pied-a-terre where they expect to spend three to four nights a week to be near their grandchildren. Two-bedroom apartments at Superior Ink have been selling for about $4 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's the ultimate luxury -- having a family that wants to send down roots together, and then being able to afford to do it,'' Mr. Sukenik said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A dozen blocks north, Penn South, a limited-equity housing complex in Chelsea that was built in the early 1960s to provide affordable housing to middle-income people, is becoming a family village. Many people who spent their childhoods there have returned with their children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vivian Connolly, now 36, and her brother, Daniel Holtzman, 43, are among them. Their mother, Harriet Holtzman, who has lived in the development since the 1970s, put their names on a waiting list for apartments in one of Penn South's 15 buildings as soon as they turned 12.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was always sort of waiting for my name to come up and I always planned to live here, unless I left New York,'' Ms. Connolly said. ''My brother and I call it the golden handcuffs, because it's such a good deal that we'll never leave -- my mom got it all worked out perfectly, but it was probably the best gift she's ever given us.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She points out, however, that when they were growing up, Chelsea was ''a scary neighborhood with gangs and people wanting to beat up my brother.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daniel Holtzman moved back first, and Ms. Connolly lived with him for a short time before she got her own studio when she was 23. Another sister also lived in the complex for a while, but has since departed for the suburbs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My brother and I are the lifers,'' said Ms. Connolly, who has moved up to a two-bedroom apartment with her husband, Chris, and their 5-year-old son. She is expecting a second baby in March, and as soon as the child is born, she will put her family on the list for the holy grail of apartments at Penn South, a three-bedroom. ''I know that will be a long wait,'' she said, ''because there aren't that many of them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, the average price of a two-bedroom apartment at Penn South is about $48,000, with maintenance starting about $900, whereas two-bedrooms elsewhere in Chelsea cost about $1.25 million. Penn South's waiting list, now closed to nonresidents, contains more than 6,000 names and applicants can expect to wait at least seven years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Holtzman said she put all three of her children on the list when they were young because she figured their names would come up around the time that they graduated from college. ''When you want to live in Manhattan,'' she said, ''you're grateful to have affordable housing wherever it is.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bonus for her, of course, is that she now has grandchildren who can walk to her apartment, just a building away from their homes, without having to cross a street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Daniel Holtzman's wife, Kathleen, moved into his Penn South apartment, they went through a period when they felt they had to establish boundaries with his mother. ''It was very strange at first,'' Kathleen Holtzman says, ''because we could see his mother's apartment from ours and we had to tell her it was unfair to call and say: 'Why didn't you pick up the phone? I knew you were home because I could see your light was on.'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But that's not an issue anymore, and once we had children, having an extended family around became so important.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their sons, Elliott, 9, and Phillip, 7, go to Harriet Holtzman's law office in Chelsea after school every Tuesday to do their homework, and Ms. Holtzman's husband, Gary Steward, often takes the boys home or over to the complex's wood shop, where they have worked on projects together. Their latest one is a single-engine airplane made out of scraps they found in the shop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aside from the Tuesday arrangement, the three families do not have any standing dates. ''No Sunday-night dinner or anything like that, because I wanted to avoid that old-fashioned obligation feeling,'' Harriet Holtzman said. ''I just consider us unbelievably lucky in our living situation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Being near grandparents and having easy backup for child care are not the only reasons adult children choose to live where they grew up. Sometimes, easy access to aging parents is just as much an incentive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eve Rachel Markewich lives in the same Upper West Side building as the Gold clan -- and her parents. Twenty years ago, when she returned to her childhood address, it was for a variety of reasons. She missed the Hudson River views, and she felt living nearby would make communicating with her father easier, because he is hard of hearing and phone conversations are a challenge. She was then a young lawyer, and her father's extensive law library also came in handy for research on weekends or at night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her parents, Robert and Iris Markewich, live in the same nine-room apartment where they met in 1947, when Mr. Markewich's aunt and uncle lived there. They made it their home in 1955, and in 1968 Mr. Markewich helped organize the building into a co-op. ''There was a lot of opposition initially,'' he said, ''but rent was starting to get oppressive. We were paying $175 a month, which was a lot of money back then.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eve Markewich's four older siblings gave her a hard time when she moved back into the building. ''They thought it was sick, because who lives in the same building as their parents?'' she said. ''But I adore them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By 1997, though, Ms. Markewich realized that while she loved being able to wander into her childhood home at will, she wasn't as keen about her parents' having a window on her life. ''Once,'' she said, ''I opened up my door to discover that my Sunday Times had been used and my parents had obviously stolen my paper and then returned it to me.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then she realized that her parents had been asking the doormen about her comings and goings. ''That was it, I had to move,'' she said, ''even though I really didn't want to leave the building.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We weren't really trying to keep tabs on Evie,'' said Iris Markewich, 83. ''We would never do something like that, because we were perfect parents,'' she added with a smile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Michaela Gold came up with the ideal solution when she helped Eve Markewich find another apartment on the other side of the building, which has a different crew of doormen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Being so close to one another came in particularly handy last spring when Iris Markewich shattered a leg in a fall, and wound up at a rehabilitation center on the East Side. ''It made things so easy for me to be able to pick up my father and take him to see her and then bring him home,'' Eve Markewich said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One night, after visiting her mother, she and her father returned to her apartment for dinner and to watch a baseball game. Mr. Markewich, who is 90 and walks with a cane, fell asleep on the couch, and at 11 p.m., when Ms. Markewich wanted to call it a night, she telephoned a sister to ask ''would it be O.K. to leave Daddy sitting there like that?'' She did and went to bed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About two hours later, she heard her father get up and head for the front door. She shouted out a good night to him and he was off. ''It was really nice to know that I didn't have to worry about him going out and looking for a cab, and that in just a few minutes he would be home,'' Eve Markewich said.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ''Living In'' column on Dec. 27, about Chickahominy, Conn., misspelled the name of a local stone mason who emigrated from Sardinia in the 1902s and was responsible for building various structures in town. He was Sebastiano Bazzoni, not Bozzoni.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Sun Jan 17 2010 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE winding roads of northern Greenwich, with their king-size homes evoking chateaux, would seem to have little in common with Chickahominy, a more proletarian neighborhood of modest-scale dwellings close to downtown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there is more than one connection. To start with, much of the granite that makes up the thick walls along wealthy Greenwich byways like, say, Lake Avenue, was quarried a century ago by Chickahominy residents, some of whom cut the rock just beyond their own backyards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In more recent years the area, 30 miles from Midtown near the New York border, provided critical middle-class housing in an upscale area, creating a foothold for teachers, construction workers and mechanics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That affordability remains a strong lure today; prices can be as much as 75 percent off the town's typical $2 million, even if some buyers today have showier backgrounds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take Cedric Jones, a former wide receiver for the New England Patriots, who was living in Stuyvesant Town in Manhattan when he got the idea to enroll his three sons in Greenwich's blue-ribbon public schools.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many town enclaves, like Old Greenwich, on the water, and Pemberwick, where he rented briefly, were a bit of a stretch, said Mr. Jones, now the athletic director for a private Manhattan club.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Chickahominy, on the other hand, he found a 2,500-square-foot two-story condo with four bedrooms, two and a half baths, hardwood floors, stainless steel appliances and a finished basement. In 2003, it cost $680,000, and came with an adjacent 950-square-foot guest house with its own bed and bath.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the biggest surprise from his perspective was Chickahominy's diversity; he described neighbors of Russian, Chilean and Brazilian descent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I thought it would be like a 'Who's the Boss?'-type place, with lots of picket fences, and a little backwoodsy,'' said Mr. Jones, referring to the 1980s TV show about an affluent, white-seeming Connecticut suburb. ''But where I live is Middle America.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That ethnic variety is a relatively recent phenomenon; during the last century Chickahominy was squarely identified with Italian-Americans, many of whom worked as masons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Celeste Nigro's father, Sebastiano Bozzoni, emigrated in the 1920s from Sardinia. Like his neighbors, she said, he worked with stone quarried at the end of the aptly named Stone Avenue, which dead-ends at a slope that hints at the area's former function.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the projects Mr. Bozzoni undertook, Ms. Nigro said, was the rectory at St. Roch's, a community landmark built in 1928 that stages a procession through the streets every August. Another contribution is Ms. Nigro's three-family home, with its brownstone facade and pink brick-topped stucco wall out front.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With seven bedrooms, three baths and 5,000 square feet, but no garage, the property, like many of the first wave of homes that went up in the 1940s, might have fetched $800,000 at the market's peak, based on comparable listings, Ms. Nigro said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, like many of her third- and fourth-generation Italian-American neighbors, she would never leave.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A certain image of Greenwich can come to mind for people from out of town, and it's not always great,'' Ms. Nigro said. ''But if you come here, you see a place that's so close-knit, with a real neighborly feel.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT YOU'LL FIND</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residents who were Civil War veterans most likely named Chickahominy for a Virginia river that influenced some key battles, as a way to honor victims, according to Greenwich's historical society.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About a mile long, the area is bounded on one end by the downtown, on the other by the Byram section -- and also by West Putnam Avenue (otherwise known as the Post Road) and the Metro-North tracks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The area, mainly farmland until after World War I, is densely settled, with 6,000 residents living in homes close to roads and one another, on tiny one-sixth-acre lots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes like these don't turn over all that frequently. Some, carved up over the years into multifamilies, are rented out; they make up about half the stock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All told, Capes, ranches and gambrel-roofed colonials, and hybrids of the three, including many with porches, date from the mid-20th century. Some are found along Josephine Evaristo Avenue, formerly Victoria Street, which was renamed in the 1980s to honor a local advocate for immigrants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a roof on nearby Harold Avenue recently was a house-width line of reindeer yoked to Santa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eighties-era condos face Glen Street, but there are also newer, attached condos, like the sharply gabled series in Hamilton Way, built by Greyrock Homes on the site of teardowns, which don't happen very often.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's also Holly Hill, on Holly Hill Lane, though owing to slow sales, brokers say, it is now functioning primarily as a rental.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other for-lease units are found at Armstrong Court, one of Greenwich's eight affordable-housing complexes. A collection of flat-roofed buildings with small terraces, the 1951 development was built to ease a housing crunch prompted by returning World War II veterans, housing officials say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jessie Ramnath, a 40-year Greenwich resident whose former husband used to work for the town, has lived in a two-bedroom at Armstrong since 1989. Over the decades, she said, Greenwich's rapid growth has sometimes been bewildering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Chickahominy, where she helps tend a vegetable plot, is slower-paced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People are so nice here,'' Ms. Ramnath said. ''Instead of shaking hands, they hug you.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT YOU'LL PAY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The year's sales through mid-December included 10 homes -- counting single- and multi-families as well as condominiums. The average price was $645,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the same time frame in 2006, at the market's height, just eight homes sold, though the average price was higher, at $720,000, according to data from the Greenwich Multiple Listing Service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A rush to put rental properties on the market accounts for 2009's increase in activity, said Valerie Pisano, a broker with Weichert Capital Properties. Landlords have sought to divest themselves of properties, because so many would-be tenants are failing stepped-up credit checks, she explained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I mean, I wouldn't give somebody an apartment'' if the person had a credit score of 500, Ms. Pisano said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A one-bedroom in an older house rents for about $1,100. A two-bedroom in a newer condo would be roughly $3,500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE COMMUTE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chickahominy is a five-minute drive from Greenwich's main train station, where nine trains run to Grand Central from 6 to 8 a.m. The trip takes an average of 49 minutes; a monthly pass costs $237, slightly less online. Parking costs $279 a year for the outdoor lot. The waiting list these days runs at least two years, according to parking services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE SCHOOLS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hamilton Avenue School, a magnet school, is a point of neighborhood pride. It has 353 children enrolled in prekindergarten through sixth grade. After a three-year-long renovation that doubled its size with new wings, it reopened its doors a year ago. A nursery school run by the YMCA across the street even provides Mandarin lessons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Western Middle School, in Byram, has 495 students; 78 percent of eighth-graders met state standards in reading, 71 percent in math, 75 percent in writing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And at Greenwich High School, among the state's best, 2,717 students can choose among 21 advance placement classes and 7 languages, including sign language, as well as 42 sports. SAT averages last year were 569 in reading, 592 in math and 577 in writing, versus 503, 508 and 506 statewide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT TO DO</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hamilton Avenue, which forms the neighborhood's spine, has the core commercial district, which consists of a few restaurants, a new thrift store selling crystal bowls and furs, and Generations Barber Parlor, with its spinning red-white-and-blue mounted pole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christiano Park, with a baseball field and a pair of tennis courts, is a few steps from a thicket of homes. But grocery shopping usually requires a drive to A&amp;P Fresh or Stop &amp; Shop, which face each other on West Putnam.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE HISTORY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the small park where Edgewood Avenue veers off Putnam stands a stone tablet reading ''28 FF,'' alerting east-bound Post Road travelers of the distance to Fairfield. A reproduction of the type of Colonial-era marker found up and down the Post Road, the tablet was probably installed in the 1970s, said Anne Young, the historical society's curator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHOTO: FOOTHOLD: Affordability is a hallmark of Chickahominy, near downtown in Greenwich. Turnover is fairly low, but homes in the area can be as much as 75 percent lower than the town's typical $2 million. (PHOTOGRAPH BY ANDREW SULLIVAN FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A MINI-BOOM is rippling along Frederick Douglass Boulevard in South Harlem, with the Douglass, a 38-unit luxury condominium at West 114th Street, the latest to join the scene.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Known not too long ago for its abandoned buildings and stubborn street crime, the area now has amenities like a yoga studio and a pet day care center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Heading north from Central Park, the area along Frederick Douglass Boulevard from West 110th to West 138th has long been viewed as ripe for renewal. Several developers are banking on it, even as the recession keeps a lid on asking prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fueled by the A, B, C and D subway lines that run beneath it, the mile-long stretch is gaining momentum from new restaurants and businesses. Recent arrivals include a <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span>, a Dunkin' Donuts and a Chase bank. A Best Yet Market is to open next month at West 118th Street. And <span class="companylink">Starwood Hotels</span> will open a midpriced boutique-style hotel in May at Frederick Douglass Boulevard and West 124th Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the recession, a high-end apartment in South Harlem was going for as much as $800 a square foot. Today, it might be $600 to the low $700s, said Stephen G. Kliegerman, the executive director of development marketing for Halstead Property, which is handling the Douglass. Other real estate professionals estimated the decline in South Harlem at 10 to 25 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These price points are relatively similar to downtown Brooklyn or Fort Greene,'' Mr. Kliegerman said, ''but here, you are in Manhattan.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While many were predicting last year that the Harlem market would slide into the $400 to low-$500 range per square foot, ''it never really came to that point'' and prices have now bottomed out and are stabilizing, he said. ''A lot of buyers who were actually pushed out of Harlem a year or two ago because prices rose so quickly are now able to come back because prices are a little bit more reasonable.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adding to the area's allure are 25-year real estate tax abatements granted a number of new buildings, including the Douglass, under the city's 421-a plan, which rewards projects that set aside some apartments at reduced prices for low-income buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Douglass (thedouglasscondo.com), which came on the market in late November, offers one- to three-bedroom units ranging from 762 to 1,355 square feet and from $529,000 to $969,000, putting the average price in the mid $600s per square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amenities at the Douglass include hardwood floors, granite countertops and high-end appliances, among them washers and dryers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The four penthouses have 12-foot ceilings, skylights and private terraces. There's also a shared courtyard and fitness room. Basement parking spots are being sold separately, for $50,000 each. There is a subway stop at 116th Street; Central Park starts four blocks south, and Morningside Park is a block and a half to the west.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During its first four weeks on the market, interest in the Douglass was very strong, even during the snowstorm last week, said Sheree Yellin Satos, the building's sales manager. ''Offers have been made on six properties, four of these have been accepted and there are negotiations on a few more,'' Ms. Yellin Satos said, declining to say precisely how many more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A second luxury condo, the Livmor (livmor.com), with 73 units and the same 25-year tax abatement, is due to open officially in January at 301 West 115th Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have had a great deal of interest, even before the printing of the offering plan,'' said Dawn Tsien, an executive vice president at Prudential Douglas Elliman, which is handling sales for the Livmor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will offer one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments from 808 to 2,100 square feet and priced from the mid $400,000s to $1.1 million or $1.2 million, some with private roof terraces. Amenities will include a yoga studio, a media room with projection TV, a children's play space and a kitchen for catered events.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I consider the Franklin Douglass Boulevard corridor to be an extension of the Upper West Side at this point,'' Ms. Tsien said. ''Many years ago, some people said you couldn't go above 68th Street, and now it is even above 125th Street.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Tien described potential buyers at the Douglass and for Harlem in general as ''people who are perhaps priced out of the Upper West Side. It is like any emerging neighborhood,'' she said. ''People have been moving to these various areas because of the attraction of the size of the apartments and the affordability of the product.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crime rate in the South Harlem area is roughly comparable to that of the Upper West Side precinct directly to the south, according to police figures. In the 28th Precinct, which stretches from Central Park North to 127th Street between Morningside and Fifth Avenues, there have been 869 crime complaints so far this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 24th Precinct, which runs from 86th Street to 110th between the Hudson River and Central Park West, has recorded 946 crime complaints so far this year</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Douglass and the Livmore join condominiums like SOHA 118 at 301 West 118th Street. SOHA 118 (soha118.com) is a 15-story building with 91 apartments ranging from one- to four-bedrooms. The building opened its doors in early 2008 and about two-thirds of its market-rate units have so far sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">The Corcoran Group</span>, which is handling sales, shows two- to four-bedroom apartments at 1,100 to 3,400 square feet and ranging in price from $740,000 to $3 million. A four-bedroom penthouse, going for $3 million, is at 3,400 square feet said to be one of the largest condos available in Harlem at this time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''At the beginning of 2009,'' said Vie Wilson, a senior vice president at Corcoran, ''the market wasn't doing much of anything. But within the last six months, six apartments have sold. There has been more interest, more people coming to see, more people making offers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The emerging luxury market is drawing almost every category of potential buyer, agents said, including families, young professionals, single women, gay couples and empty-nesters seeking to move back into the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are probably 15 or 20 new condo or co-op buildings that have popped up between 110th and 125th along Frederick Douglass Boulevard in the past six or seven years.,'' said Eric McLendon, a senior sales associate at Corcoran. ''It is good for the neighborhood and it's good for buyers as well, and the spring market is poised to be a big one. Any buyer that comes up here is going to spend much less than in other parts of the city and get more, and these luxury buildings are attracting a wider audience.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Harlem Guy,'' a blogger at HarlemCondoLife.com, a Web site dedicated to ''all that's great about Harlem,'' calls southern Harlem ''truly spectacular.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You have new condos, new stores and new restaurants springing up,'' he said in a telephone interview, concealing his real name, he explained, to ensure that he and his fellow bloggers can write honestly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It takes just half an hour to get home from Midtown by cab or train, and it's a true melting pot, just what New York is meant to be. If you're a local, you may feel priced out or unhappy over all the recent real estate activity. But from what I see and hear, there is plenty of room for everyone in Harlem; it's a huge piece of New York.''</p>

</div><div class="author">By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN   </div><div>1334 words</div><div>24 December 2009</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article on Thursday about the popularity of Ping-Pong among young people in Silicon Valley misspelled the surname of the billionaire investor who invited the top-ranked United States junior, Ariel Hsing, to play at his birthday party. He is Warren E. Buffett, not Buffet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Tue Dec 29 2009 </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MILPITAS, Calif. -- Young people who were serious about table tennis used to have to make the trip to Beijing, Stockholm or Moscow to train with world-class coaches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now they go no farther than this Silicon Valley suburb.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm trying to become one of the greatest players in the nation,'' Srivatsav Tangirala, 14, said matter-of-factly between drills at the huge new table tennis facility here. He and three dozen players, some as young as 5, sprinted sideways along the edge of the tables, 45 times in a row, perfecting their footwork.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Lean forward, lean, lean, lean, lean!'' their coach implored.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the largest training program for youths in the country, run by the India Community Center in an area that is 60 percent Asian. Here, Ping-Pong parents who grew up with the sport in Sichuan Province or Hyderabad are the new soccer moms and Little League dads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of 12 table tennis clubs in the area, up from 5 clubs in 1990, the India Community Center's Ping-Pong facility was started last year with seed money from two Indian entrepreneurs and has already become an influential hatchery for Olympic hopefuls, most of whom banter in Hindi or Mandarin at home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ariel Hsing, 14, the top-ranked United States junior, from San Jose, Calif., and Lily Zhang, 13 and ranked No. 2, from Palo Alto, Calif., are a fearsome twosome, with matching teal braces, bulging calf muscles and a dream of playing in the 2012 Olympics. Ariel cradles the ball in her palm like a baby chick -- before she lets go and smashes it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They and over 100 other teenagers, many the daughters and sons of technology professionals, are being coached by talent from around the world: Gaolin Tang from Sichuan Province; Stellan Bengtsson, the Swedish champion; and Rajul Sheth, the center's executive director, a veteran of the Indian national team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past, top players grew up in China and became American citizens in order to play for the United States Olympic team. Today, 80 percent of players age 14 and younger are Asian-Americans, according to USA Table Tennis, the sport's national governing body.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Hyphenated kids who are born and raised here and have a foot in both worlds are the ones taking the lead, '' said David Del Vecchio, a board member of the National Collegiate Table Tennis Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Milpitas, the hollow knocking sounds of Ping-Pong balls reverberate off walls lined with triumphal newspaper clippings in The Sing Tao Daily and The India Express featuring India Community Center offspring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ariel's mother, Xian Hua Jiang, a 46-year-old hardware engineer, was weaned on two-volley games on concrete tables in the schoolyard in Henan Province. Growing up poor, she had to borrow white shoes to participate in a tournament. ''Rain or shine, during school breaks everyone rushes to the tables,'' she recalled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, she and her husband, Michael Hsing, a software engineer from Taiwan, spend at least $40,000 a year fostering their daughter's talent, and have added an indoor table tennis practice room to their house. Their plastic <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> window shades are pocked with holes from the velocity of Ariel's balls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Named for <span class="companylink">Disney</span>'s ''Little Mermaid,'' Ariel juggles school and international tournaments in Tokyo, Chile and elsewhere. Her ferocious close-to-the-table backhand, honed from age 6, has generated so much buzz that two years ago she was invited to play with ''Mr. Bill'' -- as in Bill Gates, the chairman of <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> -- and ''Mr. Warren'' -- Warren E. Buffet, the investor. She overwhelmed the billionaire Ping-Pongers at Mr. Buffet's 75th birthday party in San Francisco. ''They're very humble and down to earth,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the sport's visibility is growing nationally -- thanks in part to celebrities like Susan Sarandon, who recently opened SPiN New York, a table tennis social club in Manhattan -- it does not yet have Little League-style cultural clout in the United States, which parents say makes it difficult to compete. In Germany, table tennis engenders a Los Angeles Lakers-like fever, with televised games and some professionals earning $1 million a year in endorsements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this country, the sport is still considered a hobby; only three colleges -- Texas Wesleyan University in Fort Worth; Lindenwood University in St. Charles, Mo.; and the University of Puerto Rico in San Juan -- offer table tennis scholarships.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Randy Capps, an analyst at the Migration Policy Institute in Washington, said Silicon Valley's rapidly growing Ping-Pong scene reflected the state's demographics, in which half its school-age children are the offspring of immigrants. ''The parents have competed hard to get where they are,'' Mr. Capps said. ''They expect their children to do the same.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Min Zhou, a professor of sociology at the University of California, Los Angeles, said that among Asian-Americans, there was a perception that the children would not excel at football or basketball, and that table tennis ''is a sport where they have an advantage because of cultural affinity.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Being too academically oriented has become a stereotype of the Asian-American kid,'' she said. ''Parents are grounding them in sports so the kid does not appear as nerdy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now junior teams from India and Hungary come to Milpitas to work with coaches like Sean O'Neill, an Olympian from McLean, Va. ''I had to go to Sweden'' to train, Mr. O'Neill said. ''But they've brought the world's borders inside'' the India Community Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a global game, with the Chinese coaches specializing in a fast ''flat game'' in which the ball is hit hard close to the table, while their European and Indian counterparts are ''topspinners'' who move away from the table to put more spin on the ball.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sprawling new complex is a satellite of the India Community Center, an ambitious, one-stop-shopping center for Indian culture modeled on Jewish community centers. It includes a free medical clinic, a program for retirees and Bollywood aerobics classes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In India, you walk out of the house and there is a community all around you,'' said Anil Godhwani, a co-founder of the center. ''In the U.S., we felt we were missing something.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The program started small in 2005 with five Indian players. ''The Chinese people didn't want to learn table tennis from some Indian,'' as Mr. Sheth put it. Winning 16 medals the following year at the Junior Olympics helped persuade the Chinese of the India Community Center's serious intentions. Today parents have nicknamed it ''the India-China center.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, at the United States table tennis national championships in Las Vegas, 21 players from Milpitas competed against 653 athletes from around the country, garnering 15 awards -- the most of any club.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sheth's team included Krish Avvari, a bespectacled fourth grader known for his mean loop forehand, and Ariel Hsing, known as a powerful ''two-winged attacker,'' comfortable with backhand or forehand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I want to control who wins and who loses,'' Ariel said of her style -- an exercise perhaps in the most subtle art of spin.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The author of the <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span> posting in Las Vegas made no effort to disguise his or her intentions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Stripping House -- Before Foreclosure,'' the ad declared, offering potential buyers the cabinets and countertops, the sinks and toilets, the doors, the appliances, the sprinklers. Even the palm and citrus trees in the yard were for sale, with a catch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You dig,'' the author advised.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Nevada and other states hit hard by the housing crisis, stripping fixtures and appliances from homes in foreclosure has become commonplace. <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span>, the Web site for classified ads, functions as a bazaar where stripped items are sold openly. Often, the stripping is not done by strangers. It is done by the owner, just before the bank forecloses on the mortgage and takes the property back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If that seems like a situation tailor-made for the police, it is -- at least in Arizona, where the Federal Bureau of Investigation has used <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span> to arrest a handful of people for stripping homes and trying to sell the goods, charging them with felonies under a state fraud statute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other parts of the country, however, the police are stymied. As it turns out, several troubled states, like Nevada, have no specific criminal prohibition against stripping fixtures from a property before foreclosure. Mortgage contracts do prohibit such behavior, requiring that homes be kept in good order. But violating those provisions is a civil matter, not a criminal offense.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If the homeowner sells the components to the house while they still own the house, that's not a crime,'' said Officer Bill Cassell, a spokesman for the Las Vegas police.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So too in Florida, another state swamped by foreclosures. Several prosecutors and police agencies there said that unless laws were modified, such behavior would have to be sorted out between borrower and lender in civil court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in Arizona, which has an applicable law and where thousands of homes have been stripped, convictions are rare. There, to make a charge stick, law enforcement basically has to catch people in the act, said Julie Halferty, a special agent with the F.B.I. in Phoenix and head of a mortgage fraud task force.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This window of time can be quite short,'' Ms. Halferty said in an e-mail message. ''Once homes are abandoned, arguably any number of people can get access and strip the fixtures.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Statistics on foreclosure stripping are elusive, and experts disagree on just how widespread the practice is. Yet even those who play down the number acknowledge that the problem is serious, particularly in housing boom-and-bust areas like central Arizona, southwest Florida and the Las Vegas region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Clearly it's happening, and it's happening with some frequency,'' said John A. Courson, president of the Mortgage Bankers Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks are largely powerless to stop a homeowner determined to strip a property. Lenders can pursue such homeowners in court, but the expense and difficulty typically outweigh the gain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the efforts are scattered and feeble, law enforcement officials are trying in places to stop the practice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last April, Randolph Guzman, 42, of Phoenix, was arrested while trying to strip appliances and fixtures from an investment home he owned, shortly before a bank was to hold an auction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Guzman posted an ad on <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span> and found a married couple interested in buying the air-conditioners, kitchen cabinets, ceiling fans and a light fixture for $2,300. They met at the house, in Surprise, a distant Phoenix suburb, and Mr. Guzman accepted a down payment of $400 in cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then he was handcuffed and read his rights. The couple, he discovered, were police officers working undercover with the F.B.I.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Guzman pleaded guilty to defrauding a secured creditor, a felony. If he completes 18 months of probation, the charge will be reduced to a misdemeanor, he will serve no jail time and pay only a few hundred dollars in court fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Michael Cantor, Mr. Guzman's attorney, called his client's offense minor when compared with the thousands of homes that have been thoroughly stripped by their former owners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I understand why they want to crack down on this stuff, but Randy is small potatoes,'' Mr. Cantor said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the F.B.I. publicized the arrest of Mr. Guzman and a handful of others caught stripping homes, the number of ads for stripped goods on <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span> in Phoenix dropped sharply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That was our objective -- to get the word out that stripping a foreclosed home is illegal,'' Ms. Halferty said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(<span class="companylink">Craigslist</span> does not vet the postings created by its users, and a spokeswoman, Susan MacTavish Best, said the site had not been contacted by law officials about ads for stripped merchandise. ''One wonders how one would know the provenance of each fixture and appliance,'' she wrote in an e-mail message.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The police in Las Vegas would like to follow the lead of those in Phoenix, but Nevada law hinders them. ''We don't have the tools to prosecute,'' said David Roger, district attorney for Clark County, which includes Las Vegas. ''It's obviously an issue that the legislature should address.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all legal experts agree that existing law is insufficient, given that homeowners who strip a house are violating their mortgage contracts. General fraud statutes might be stretched to apply. Yet so far, few prosecutors or the police -- dealing with budget cutbacks -- are making arrests or bringing cases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The key to reducing the number of homes being stripped, experts suggest, lies not with the law but with lenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If banks focused more on prevention, everybody would be better off, particularly them,'' said Kenneth Thomas, a banking consultant in Miami.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already, some indicators suggest that mortgage servicers are starting to delay the final step in a foreclosure -- seizing the home -- in part to limit the number of homes being stripped and vandalized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet for some areas, it is too late. In several Phoenix suburbs, the stripping of homes appears to have peaked, but not before taking a heavy toll.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Maricopa, a distant Phoenix suburb that had rapid growth before the crash, new developments were stripped one after another, often in the order they were built, according to Shawn Schlegel, a real estate broker who publishes a weekly community newspaper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The same way they built the city is the same way the city got stripped out,'' Mr. Schlegel said. ''It's gone through every neighborhood.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Florida, the online trade in stripped goods is brisk, no doubt encouraged by the low profile of the police. As in most of the country, sympathy for banks is running low, and opportunism is running high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some see an upside. Justin Cellini, 29, spent the last year being rejected by lender after lender in his quest for a home loan. Finally, with cash from relatives, he was able to buy a four-bedroom, two-bath house in Hollywood, Fla., that had been stripped by its former occupants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He paid $111,000. ''I'm actually thankful that they stripped the house,'' Mr. Cellini said. ''It wound up costing me a lot less money in the end.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has been refurbishing it on the cheap -- by buying fixtures and appliances off <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span>.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The coming year is almost certain to be brutal for the commercial real estate market in New York. More landlords will be unable to hang onto their buildings or refinance their mortgages, swelling the inventory of distressed properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But though rents in Manhattan office buildings are expected to continue falling and the vacancy rate is expected to increase, real estate specialists say that the panic has subsided and that some investors are prepared to bet on the long-term future of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As one hopeful sign, some analysts cite the recent purchase by the real estate investment trust <span class="companylink">SL Green Realty</span>, Manhattan's largest office landlord, of a construction mortgage for 510 Madison Avenue, an empty new Midtown office building at 53rd Street, which is being developed by the father-and-son team of Harry and William Macklowe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conceived in headier times before the Macklowes lost most of their real estate empire, the slender 30-story glass tower has floors of 10,000 square feet and was intended for hedge fund operators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At an investors' conference on Dec. 7, before the 510 Madison loan acquisition was announced, Marc Holliday, SL Green's chief executive, said that although New York had lost 81,000 office jobs and could lose as many as 45,000 more, ''I can now confidently say that the worst is behind us.'' He predicted that the vacancy rate, now 13 percent, would not exceed 15 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SL Green's decision to buy this loan ''speaks volumes about management's more optimistic view on both leasing and building values,'' Michael Knott, a REIT analyst at Green Street Advisors (which is unrelated to SL Green), said in a recent report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a significant turnaround for SL Green, which has issued new equity and sold weaker assets during the past year to strengthen its balance sheet. ''Six months ago, this company was trying to stay in business,'' said Ross T. Nussbaum, a REIT analyst for <span class="companylink">UBS</span>. ''Now they are on the prowl again for opportunities.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the loan purchase shows that SL Green is hopeful about Manhattan's recovery, it also suggests that the company is prepared to engage in a bare-knuckles battle with Harry Macklowe, one of the city's most litigious property owners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SL Green did not disclose the purchase price for the 510 Madison loan or make anyone available for an interview, but other executives familiar with the deal say the company paid the original lender, <span class="companylink">Union Labor Life Insurance Company</span>, $170 million for the $267.5 million mortgage. The discount was modest, however, because SL Green will have to dole out $70 million or more to complete the building and cover leasing costs and the creation of office interiors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several brokers and analysts said the company had not bought the loan simply to collect mortgage payments because the low returns would not have justified the risk. Instead, they say, SL Green's sole goal is to foreclose on the Macklowes and gain possession of the building. ''They didn't invest in this loan to get a coupon return,'' said one Wall Street analyst, who said his company prohibits him from speaking publicly about a deal he has not written about.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to angling for 510 Madison, SL Green also expects to assume ownership of 100 Church Street, a 1.1 million-square-foot building near the World Trade Center, which is more than half vacant. SL Green bought three mezzanine loans for the building for $41 million in 2007 and has operated it since last month, when the previous landlord, the Sapir Organization, withdrew a lawsuit seeking to block foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the reasons the building has fared so poorly, Steven M. Durels, SL Green's leasing director, told investors, was ''a seriously flawed lobby renovation, which included a spraying water fountain and more than 30 hideous crystal chandeliers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SL Green, which expects to spend $20 million to reposition the building, ''will have to work some leasing magic'' to protect its investment in 100 Church, Mr. Knott said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If SL Green succeeds in wresting 510 Madison from the Macklowes, the company will own the building for about $750 to $800 a square foot, including foreclosure and other costs. The Macklowes, who began assembling their site in the late 1990s, paid $440 million, or $1,200 a foot, in land and development costs. If they lose the building to SL Green, which owns interests in 27 office buildings in Manhattan, the Macklowes will not get the lucrative management and leasing contracts that a conventional lender might have given them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Macklowes may find themselves backed into a corner by restrictions preventing them from offering space in the building at the market rent. A clause in most loans bars borrowers from leasing space at levels below the rates agreed on when the loan was issued. SL Green is expected to play hardball and not approve any leases below the agreed-upon rates negotiated by the Macklowes with the original lender. The Macklowes, who are certain to fight back in court, had no public comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the economy faltered, only one tenant, Jay Goldman &amp; Company, a hedge fund, had committed to occupy space, at $135 a foot. The company has sued to back out of the lease, saying that the building was not delivered on time -- a delay that the Macklowes attributed to an electrical fire in February. The watchmaker Tourneau is seeking to rescind a lease for ground-floor retail space at $550 a square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the peak of the market, some tenants were paying $150 a foot or more to be in the most prestigious buildings. In 2009, only 16 leases were signed at annual rents above $100 a square foot, compared with 105 such deals in 2008 and 107 in 2007, said Ben Friedland, a senior vice president at <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>. In 2008, the average high-end deal was $126 a square foot, but this year, the average dropped to $109, Mr. Friedland said. ''With some exceptions for unique opportunities, the top of the market is now between $100 and $110 a square foot,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of those exceptions was Banco Itau of Brazil's recent lease of $130 a foot at the General Motors Building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike that building, 510 Madison does not overlook Central Park, but brokers say it has many features that boutique financial services firms find attractive, including space that is virtually column-free, providing clear sight lines between the head traders and the teams out on the floor; floor-to-ceiling glass; and the sleek, minimalist look for which the Macklowes are known.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeffrey W. Baker, an executive managing director of Savills, a real estate investment banking firm, said he tried to buy the building for a foreign client before the economic crisis. ''It's going to compete head-to-head with the Seagram Building,'' Mr. Baker said, referring to the modernist tower on Park Avenue and 53rd Street. ''It's going to be viewed as one of the very top buildings in Manhattan.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, it may be tough to attract new tenants because of the uncertainty over the building's ownership. Robert M. White Jr., the president of <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>, a research firm, said the building would be more attractive to tenants without the Macklowes, whose future has seemed uncertain ever since they had to surrender seven buildings they bought in early 2007. ''Its biggest obstacle for leasing has been the ownership,'' Mr. White said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ  </div><div>1033 words</div><div>23 December 2009</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data released on Tuesday indicated that the economic recovery, while still uneven, has carried into the end of the year, and analysts expect it to gain strength, a view seconded by investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fragile housing sector showed signs of firming up, according to a report from the National Association of Realtors, with existing home sales climbing a greater-than-expected 7.4 percent in November, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.54 million, up from 6.09 million in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists cautioned that the results reflected a rush to take advantage of an $8,000 tax credit for first-time home buyers and would probably taper off in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's good news, but we're still in a very depressed housing market,'' said Guy D. Cecala, publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance, a weekly newsletter. ''We need a bunch more of these increases before we can say we have a healthy or stabilized housing market.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage applications have recently declined, and economists expect home sales to remain in a deep slump next year, rising briefly in the spring but then falling again after the housing credit expires in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales were up 44.1 percent compared with November 2008, and inventories fell to 3.52 million homes, down significantly from peaks last year. But that figure does not include the large number of homes foreclosed by banks that are not listed with realty agents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market for high-priced homes also remained subdued, an indication that as household incomes and credit streams dry up, consumers are turning to low and midrange options.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices were essentially flat from October, with the median sales price at $172,600, but they were down 4.3 percent from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report showed that the economic recovery was weaker than expected in the third quarter, held back by slow business construction and dwindling inventories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said the economy expanded at an annual rate of 2.2 percent from July through September, down from the original forecast of 3.5 percent. The downward revision was well above average, but analysts still foresee stronger growth in the fourth quarter as exports rise and an improved jobs market encourages consumer spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We did get off to a slightly slower start than we had thought,'' said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist for IHS Global Insight. ''That would be very worrying if we didn't have evidence that we had done well in the fourth quarter.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stock markets showed solid gains, with the Dow Jones industrial average climbing 50.79 points, or 0.49 percent, to 10,464.93.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index gained 3.97 points, or 0.36 percent, to 1,118.02, after touching an intraday high for the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Nasdaq composite index rose 15.01 points, or 0.67 percent, to 2,252.67.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The benchmark 10-year Treasury bill was down 21/32, to 96 28/32. The yield was 3.75 percent, up from 3.67 percent late Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the new year approaches, investors are optimistic that the economy will build on its earlier gains rather than fall into another downturn. Retail sales were higher than expected in November, and the trade deficit unexpectedly narrowed in October. In addition, a weak dollar is making American products overseas cheaper, contributing to hope that exports will rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the third quarter was weaker than forecast, it was the first period of growth in a year, suggesting the longest contraction since World War II had ended. Government stimulus efforts, like the popular cash-for-clunkers program, helped spur spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts were caught off guard by the size of the decline in the rate of expansion, measured in terms of gross domestic product -- the total value of goods and services in the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, the government revised the rate to 2.8 percent in the third quarter, down from 3.5 percent in October, and economists surveyed by Bloomberg expected it to remain steady.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A revival of exports and consumer spending in the last part of 2009 is expected to bring the rate of growth to about 5 percent for the fourth quarter. The momentum will probably continue into 2010, economists say, though high levels of unemployment and a skittish business climate may curb consumer spending, hiring and production.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department's revisions were based on smaller-than-expected business inventories, which fell by $139.2 billion. Spending by businesses on items like software and equipment was also weaker than expected, rising by 5 percent rather than the 8.4 percent originally predicted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Dales, chief economist for Toronto-based Capital Economics, said the drop was ''nothing to worry about,'' but he expressed concern about the decrease in investment by businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It may suggest that a lot of the demand pent up during the recession has already been released,'' Mr. Dales wrote in a research note Tuesday. ''High uncertainty and lots of spare capacity are limiting capital spending.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of business facilities like malls and office buildings fell more than previously thought, by 18.4 percent rather than 15.1 percent. Economists attribute that drop to a frail commercial real estate market, which is confronting high vacancy rates and banks that are reluctant to finance business expansions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spending by state and local governments was also weaker than expected, falling 0.6 percent, compared with the 0.1 percent originally forecast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer spending was revised slightly, growing 2.8 percent in the quarter rather than 2.9 percent.</p>

</div><div class="author">By ALISON GREGOR   </div><div>935 words</div><div>20 December 2009</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN the new home financing landscape created in this recession, certain categories of high-rise development are apparently on the verge of dying out, and one is the ''condotel.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Popular in Las Vegas and Miami, condotels were catching on New York City when the credit crunch hit in 2008. A combination of a hotel and condominiums in one building, the condotel, or condo-hotel, gives condo buyers access to hotel services, but often restricts their occupancy during the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During periods when the owner is not in residence, the hotel rents out the condo, providing the owner with income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Examples of the condotel are the ritzy Plaza Hotel residences at 768 Fifth Avenue and 59th Street, and several Trump buildings, including the new Trump SoHoat 246 Spring Street and Varick Street, which will open to residents in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem is that banks have been unwilling to finance buyers in condotels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rodrigo Nino, the president of Prodigy Network, which is marketing the 391-unit Trump SoHo, said he believes the financing problem struck as early as the end of 2007. The Trump SoHo began sales in September 2007, and now that it is almost time for buyers to close, many are having difficulty obtaining financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is no financing for condo-hotels, so people have to buy in cash,'' Mr. Nino said. ''What we think is, out of the original sales, we're going to lose 10 to 15 percent of the people who won't be able to close because of lack of financing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nino said more than 55 percent of the units in the Trump SoHo's first phase were in contract, but would not say how many units that was.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The developers of the Pieds-a-Terre at the Plaza said they had sold about half of the 152 condos at the condotel. The first recorded sales were in early 2006. Developers indicated that they had worked out financing in some form, but didn't offer details.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our banks recognize that the Plaza's Pieds-a-Terre are a distinctive product,'' said Thomas Elliott, the executive vice president for sales and marketing for the owner, El-Ad Properties, in an e-mail message. ''They are prepared to respond to potential purchasers to craft creative deals on the merits and on an individual basis at this extraordinary location.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Raphael De Niro, a managing director at Prudential Douglas Elliman, was planning a 205-unit Manhattan condotel called the Nobu Hotel and Residences with his father, the actor and real estate developer Robert De Niro. That deal fell through, for reasons other than the financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are condo-hotels that developers do to get around commercial zoning,'' the younger Mr. De Niro said, ''and those are like the Trump SoHo, where buyers can only use the unit 90 or 120 days, and then it gets thrown into a rental pool. Those types of condo-hotels are proving to not be successful.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The De Niros now plan to open a different version of a condotel, in South Beach, in Miami. Here, the buyers can stay as long as they like, but the hotel will not rent out the units when they are not there. Condo owners will have access to hotel services, much as they do at the Residences at the <span class="companylink">Ritz-Carlton</span> at 10 West Street in Battery Park City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like the De Niros, the developers of the 346-unit 75 Wall Street Condominiums in the financial district, which are in the same building as Hyatt's soon-to-open Andaz Wall Street, decided to forgo the typical condotel model.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''<span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> will not approve a condo-hotel under their guidelines,'' said Larry Kruysman, the sales director for 75 Wall Street, which is being marketed by the Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group. ''In today's market, all the banks want to do loans that are approved by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, so they can sell them on the secondary market in the future.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kruysman said 75 Wall Street, which sells hotel services to condo buyers a la carte, is a <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>-approved project. Because 75 Wall Street allows its condos to be subleased for a term of three months -- unusual for condo developments, which typically require lease terms of a year -- the development has attracted foreign buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreign buyers are often drawn to condotels. Intending to use the unit infrequently, they don't mind the restrictions on occupancy, and like the convenience and income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kruysman says they either pay in cash or use bank financing that he found after much searching.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Lloyds TSB International will do loans in New York,'' he said. ''I've done several of those for foreign nationals. But one thing that isn't appealing for people is that it's almost a floating interest rate. By year's end, the rate may have changed many times, which makes it hard to judge if it makes sense for you as an investment vehicle.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CHRISTMAS has always been my existential holiday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I left home when I was 13, after my mother died. I lived on the streets of Chicago for a year, sleeping on rooftops and in broom closets and breaking into boiler rooms when it became too cold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I was 14 when I was arrested sleeping in a hallway. By then my father had moved, and I didn't know where he lived, so the state took custody. I spent the next four years in a series of group homes and state-financed institutions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the group homes, holidays weren't so bad because we teenagers were all in the same parentless boat. Depending on the home, we would be given presents and there would be a nice meal. Volunteers would take us ice skating or bowling or something like that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was when I became a nominal adult, a student at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign, that I began to understand my predicament.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Winter break would come; the students scattered; the dorms closed. And I had to figure out where to go.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One year I hitchhiked west, hoping to make it to Los Angeles but only getting as far as Tucson before running out of time and catching a Greyhound bus back to the university.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another year I went to Mexico, traveling by bus with a student pass, staying in boarding homes and sneaking into the fancy hotels and lying next to the pool. On the road I didn't have to explain myself, or why I thought I didn't have anywhere to go. It's lonely traveling on Christmas, but nobody sees it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were also times when I returned to Chicago to spend Christmas with the Bell family, whom I lived with before starting college. The Bells were poor. They owned a house -- a two-story frame house built in the 1930s, bought with a $5,000 inheritance used as a down payment and a G.I. loan. But that was it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mom, Maria, whom everybody called Ma Bell, raised three children in that house virtually by herself while working as an administrative assistant at the Catholic Charities. Her youngest son, Jason, and I were friends, and she didn't seem to mind when, just after turning 18, I left the group home and showed up with a bag of possessions and moved into the basement. I stayed eight months, pitching in sometimes with money from a part-time job and helping a little around the house, but not much. It was a generous family, and I took more than I gave.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My first Christmas with the Bells was during my first or second year of college. I told Ma I was coming, and she said, ''You're always welcome.'' That year I saw the pattern. All the children would get presents: a bakeware set for Chrissy, the oldest daughter; a drill for Benny, the oldest son; a toolbox for Jason. I would get a T-shirt or socks. It was simple commerce; my presents didn't cost as much. The difference in price was the clearest reminder that I was an outsider who had been taken in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now I'm 38 and Christmas is about the babies, and I don't notice the price tags on my presents. The Bells' house has been sold and Ma lives in the far north suburbs, still struggling financially. I tell her that I'm writing about our old Christmases, that I have mixed feelings about them. I tell her it made me a little sad that my presents didn't cost as much. She tells me it was complicated for her as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I never knew if you were coming,'' she says. ''You would never commit to anything. The day before you might tell me you were coming home. But I was so happy when you were there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She made me a stocking, which she did for all her children, and hung it over the mantelpiece. It was there whether I arrived or not. And it was true, what she said. I had a foot out the door. I got used to running away at an early age. I don't know how to commit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This was my Christmas lie. I preferred to think I didn't have a home, that I wasn't part of a family. But it wasn't true. At least not completely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Did I ever bring you presents?'' I ask her.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't know,'' she says. ''It doesn't matter.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To help me remember, she brings me pictures from 18, 20 years ago. There's Jason in long underwear, shirtless, an eagle and a skull with wings tattooed on his shoulder, holding his freshly unwrapped fishing rod. There's Benny holding what looks like a handheld video game device. There's Ma in her moccasin boots with all the food spread out on the table. Chrissy, the only child to have already left home, her face poking above a new purple sweater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there I am in the chair by the front window. Why didn't somebody tell me to get a haircut and wear clothes that fit? There's a picture of Jason and me leaning over the couch, Chrissy and Michelle, Benny's girlfriend, sitting next to Benny, all of us looking at the photo album open on Benny's lap. In the next picture I'm face down on the couch. Chrissy and I are both asleep, the cat impassively between us, the coffee table covered in candy wrappers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are so many pictures. Here, we're passing a pie. There, we're slicing a ham. Everybody seems to be smiling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One year we had a Goodwill Christmas,'' Ma says. ''Everybody's presents were from Goodwill. There was never any money. I worked so hard and I was exhausted but I didn't want anybody to go. I would sit on the couch and you would all tell stories, one after another. And you would all laugh and laugh, and that was my reward. I would sit on the couch and close my eyes and listen to you all laughing. It made me so happy because life was hard. Nobody helped. My first husband didn't help. My second husband was a junkie.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I tell her I remember. I remember the laughing. The laughs seemed endless, even though Jason and Chrissy were in recovery and Ma's boyfriend was stuck in a series of difficult low-paying jobs. Maybe it was Benny doing voices: the Indian storeowner, the used-car salesman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here is a picture. Just a Christmas tree in front of the staircase, covered in tinsel, an angel on top. Beneath the tree are presents, carefully wrapped in blue, green and red. To the right, on the wall, is a picture of an Indian and a buffalo. On the floor, against the TV stand, an Elvis record. It's almost a cliche, all the symbols meaning exactly what you think they mean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What was the joke?'' I ask. ''What were the stories we were telling?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't know,'' Ma says. ''I remember the laughing, but I can't remember what was so funny.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SIDE BY SIDE on a quiet South Nyack street with striking Hudson River views, Jeanette Corvino and Jeffrey Hall have each been trying to sell expensive houses in a challenging market. But the similarity of their neighboring situations ends there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Corvino has a four-unit Italianate Victorian that she bought as an investment property more than four years ago and now needs to unload before a balloon payment on a second mortgage comes due.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hall and his wife, Sharon, have a colonial revival and are empty nesters with more than a quarter-century's worth of equity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After listing her property with a real estate agent for almost a year for $892,000, Ms. Corvino decided in June that she could not afford to pay a broker's fee on the sale and is now trying to sell the house on her own for $840,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For his part, Mr. Hall picked up the telephone and called the same agent who sold him and his wife their house 26 years ago. They have set an asking price of $899,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It would never even occur to me not to use an agent,'' he said. ''But I'm a restoration architect. I live in the past.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are real estate brokers -- like travel agents and other middlemen coping with the increasingly digital culture -- in danger of becoming expensive anachronisms?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After all, it is only logical that as people feel more empowered based on their access to information and their ability to connect without help, they are at least questioning the wisdom of the conventional way of buying and selling a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the National Association of Realtors, the percentage of homes sold nationally by their owners has actually declined, from 14 percent in 2004 to 11 percent in 2009. But Real Trends, a company that monitors the residential brokerage industry, considers those findings to be low, and estimates that the number of for-sale-by-owner, or FSBO, homes was almost one in five three years ago, when it stopped tracking them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've been in this business for 33 years and I've always wondered why more people didn't say, 'I'm going to take a shot at this myself,' '' said Steve Murray, the editor of Real Trends' reports. ''Now, with the technology available, that would seem to be inevitable. We tracked FSBO numbers through 2006 -- before the market collapsed -- and we were already seeing substantial differences between the attitudes and habits of people under 35 and those over 50.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Younger people, he said, are far more likely to embrace the multitasking and risk taking involved in selling their own homes. If the decision to use an agent is becoming generational as well as situational, that would not augur well for real estate agents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is going to sound bad, but I just don't give a lot of credence to what brokers do,'' said Cynthia LeStar, who is selling her studio apartment on the Upper East Side. ''I mean, what do they do that I can't do on my own?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. LeStar, 30, moved to New York from Cincinnati on Sept. 9, 2001, and was on a PATH train to the World Trade Center station from Hoboken for an interview with <span class="companylink">JPMorgan</span> on the morning of Sept. 11. Despite her parents' pleas to come home, she took the job and, after a few years, decided to buy instead of rent. But she was laid off last spring, and recently concluded that she could no longer carry her studio while changing careers -- to acting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. LeStar consulted streeteasy.com for comparable neighborhood sales and settled on an asking price of $444,000. She placed an ad on craigslist.com and expanded her search for buyers by gaining access to ASmallWorld, a private international online community that she likened to a celebrity <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>. Marketing her apartment has cost her nothing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. LeStar's background in finance made her comfortable in representing herself. ''Even when I was buying, I would have preferred cutting out the middleman,'' she said. ''I felt out of the loop. I love negotiating.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like Ms. LeStar, Ms. Corvino, 35, was undaunted by the prospect of catering to potential buyers. She says that she has not seen any appreciable difference in the amount of traffic now that she is in charge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Corvino bought the house hoping to turn it into a bed-and-breakfast. But when the economy tanked, she needed the income from renting all four units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Selling in this market is difficult, because it takes a special person to buy a large home like this one,'' she said. ''Not to mention that right now it's a rental property.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To appear more businesslike, she hired a graphic artist to produce a sign that ''didn't look like those chintzy red ones that say For Sale By Owner.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Corvino also created a Web site for the 4,600-square-foot house, 46Voorhis.com, where she posted 43 color photos taken by a professional photographer. She placed ads at craigslist.com and loopnet.com, a commercial real estate site. A sales manager for a wine wholesaler and importer, Ms. Corvino monitors responses via her mobile phone and has been able to break away from her job to show the house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Factoring in the minimal cost of open houses, she estimates that she has spent $1,000 thus far, a far cry from the $40,000 to $50,000 broker's fee that she would have to pay if she sold for near her asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think if you go about it the right way, you don't need an agent,'' Ms. Corvino said. ''But that's if you can take all the calls, answer all the e-mails and be at the house at 3 o'clock in the afternoon.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next door, Mr. Hall said he and his wife, who works in the Nyack school district, do not have the time, inclination or technical expertise to sell their own house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I wouldn't call myself Internet savvy,'' said Mr. Hall, 55. ''I don't have an iPhone. I wouldn't know what avenues to use. I also think the personal touch is important, though the younger generation probably feels that <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> is a human relationship.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the Halls decided to sell their house last July, there was no question that they would list it with Suzanne Blaisdell Grant of Wright Bros. Real Estate in Nyack. Mr. Hall has served on town boards with Mrs. Grant's husband and considers them old friends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Grant cited her longstanding relationship with the Halls as a prime example of why real estate brokers are not endangered and why what they do cannot be compared to selling a stock or booking a vacation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I can understand why people would say, 'Why would I pay someone to sell my house? It's a lovely house. I'll just put a sign out,' '' Mrs. Grant said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But it's so much more than that, much more than selling a stock or buying a car on <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span>. It's being honest with the seller in staging the house, getting it ready. It's giving the seller distance, because people who are emotionally involved in a purchase or sale of something as big and life-shaping as a home aren't necessarily in the best position to be objective.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jennifer Juergens of Manhattan and her four brothers and two sisters came to that conclusion after their mother died in 2007 and they put her Tudor-style house in Larchmont up for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It needed some work, but the market at the time was strong and Larchmont is a very desirable town,'' said Ms. Juergens, 48, a former magazine editor who now works in public relations. ''My brother said he thought we didn't need a broker, we could sell it by ourselves. So we put an ad on <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span> and listed it for $1 million. The first guy that came to see it with his wife, before it was even cleaned up, told my brother John, 'Oh, we love it; we'll give you $1 million.'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But,'' Ms. Juergens continued, ''he also wanted his father to see it. The dad came over and said, 'We're going to start with the asking price and work our way down.' They went room to room and he kept saying, 'Well, this needs replacing, this is old, this isn't good.' Everything negative. This was the house we'd grown up in. Our mother had just died. Emotions were high. My brother got so upset he just asked them to leave.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now supporting Mrs. Grant's contention that there is no better buffer than a broker, the family hired <span class="companylink">Keller Williams Realty</span> of Scarsdale and embarked upon a cleanup plan. The house is listed at $899,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Linda West Eckhardt, an author of cookbooks, has her Dutch colonial in Maplewood, N.J., on the market for $345,000. She has sold homes in Texas, Oregon and California, and is firmly in the get-an-agent camp -- with a caveat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having worked with agents who were ''indifferent, incompetent and otherwise disappointing,'' she said, ''I feel about real estate agents the way I feel about literary agents -- those areas are filled with peril.'' But, she added, ''I believe they'll get you more than enough to make up for their fee.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So Ms. West Eckhardt's advice is to ''interview, interview, interview'' brokers. But this time around, serendipity played a role in her selection. At a party in Maplewood, she met Joanne Douds, who works for <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span> in Fort Lee, N.J.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''She says the hard things to me, like 'Your house smells like dogs,' '' Ms. West Eckhardt said. ''On the day of the open house, she walked in with her makeup and eyelashes six inches in front of her face and Prada shoes, took one look at what I considered neat and clean, rolled up her sleeves and said, 'Get me the vacuum cleaner.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. West Eckhardt said that at 70, she is more eager to churn out several more books than to spend time extolling the Maplewood-South Orange school district to a trail of bright-eyed couples.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as Ms. LeStar has discovered while showing her Upper East Side studio, there is not that much extolling to do. ''The buyers walk in and they know as much about the apartment as you do,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Technology has made it much easier for people to educate themselves, a trend that agents have had to acknowledge and adjust to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not like it was 10 years ago, where you might show someone eight houses in a day,'' said Russ Woolley, the president of Wright Bros. Real Estate. ''They have already been online and know what they like and don't like. They may have seen 20 pictures of one house.'' Potential buyers, he said, now arrive with specific houses in mind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dan Murray, a firefighter in the South Bronx, is hedging his bets and working both ends of the real estate equation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To market their three-bedroom condominium in Riverdale, Mr. Murray and his wife, Diana, placed ads online and paid a one-time fee of $300 to forsalebyowner.com, which placed the property with the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listings Service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Murray, 40, is prepared to pay the agent who delivers a buyer 2 percent of the selling price, substantially less than the standard industry fee of 5 percent to 6 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, in his search for a new home in northern Westchester County, he is using <span class="companylink">Google</span> maps and satellite photos, while scouring the same sites he is advertising on for a FSBO.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I would think anyone who is comfortable with the Internet would prefer to do it this way,'' Mr. Murray said. ''Eventually, who won't be?''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EDWARD T. STEIN may end up as a minuscule footnote in New York financial history, because he had the misfortune, or perhaps the good fortune, of seeing his multimillion-dollar Ponzi scheme unravel in the shadow of the much larger machinations of Bernard L. Madoff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stein was an investment adviser based in Roslyn, N.Y., on Long Island. Last year, with his scheme -- to pay investors with money raised from other investors -- running out of money, Mr. Stein was under pressure to close on a $1.6 million one-bedroom apartment at a new glass and steel condominium at 170 East End Avenue on the Upper East Side. So, according to a federal complaint, he used funds wired in by one of his clients to pay for the 1,335-square-foot condominium.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stein is awaiting sentencing in February after pleading guilty to four counts of security fraud and one count of mail fraud. His newly decorated apartment, where he was arrested and from which he was led in handcuffs in April, was sold on Dec. 8 by a court-appointed receiver in an unusual transaction: The condominium board exercised a little-used right, that of first refusal, to reject a buyer and buy the apartment instead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time of his arrest, Mr. Stein, 60, was said by prosecutors to have defrauded his clients in a $55 million Ponzi scheme, although they later reduced their estimate to $30 million. The actual size of the loss, which will be used in sentencing, is still being calculated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Mr. Stein pleaded guilty, victims of the scheme, including the woman who wired him $3 million about the time of his closing, testified at the hearing, describing the hurt and loss they suffered, just as the larger group of Madoff victims did.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July, soon after Mr. Stein pleaded guilty, Bonnie Brown, a broker at Halstead Property, put the apartment on East End Avenue on the market for the same price Mr. Stein had paid for it, $1.6 million. At the time, the market was still in the doldrums, and in August, with the approval of the court, she cut the price to $1.5 million. In September, two buyers, Ian and Francine Shore of Monroe Township, N.J., contracted to buy it for $1.3 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was within the range of three appraisals filed with the court, and the contract was approved. But the board at 170 East End Avenue, in particular its president, was not happy with the price. The board is headed by Orin Wilf, the president of Skyline Properties, the building's developer, and Mr. Wilf owned five apartments there, including a penthouse on the market for $17.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stein's apartment was not the most valuable unit in the building, since it is on the second floor and has a view of the trees out front, rather than the city skyline. But the purchase price that the Shores negotiated works out to less than $1,000 per square foot at a time that sales in the building averaged more than $1,900 a square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I wanted to protect the investments of other people who bought in the building,'' Mr. Wilf said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Shores had been looking at the building for three years and had been in discussions with Mr. Wilf to buy one of his apartments, a two-bedroom. That apartment had a price tag of $1.6 million, Mr. Wilf said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While many co-op boards have the right to reject buyers, most condominium boards do not. Instead, they may exercise a right to buy the apartment at the same price offered by the buyer. Ms. Brown said that in more than two decades as a broker this was the first time she had seen a condo board exercise its right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 170 East End Avenue, the board allowed Mr. Wilf to take over the contract and close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate deal with the court-appointed receiver, Mr. Wilf also bought Mr. Stein's furniture and artwork. Now that the market is more active, he is listing the apartment for sale, fully furnished, for $2.45 million, or more than $1,800 a square foot, with Barbara Russo, a Corcoran broker.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IT seems fitting that Shayne McQuade, who makes a living selling backpacks and bags that generate solar power, should have a place in the sun: a garden with 1,650 square feet of space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But his new garden will be in the middle of Greenwich Village, with views of the Empire State Building, rather than in the Gobi Desert or on the Appalachian Trail. And it will be planted 14 stories in the air, at the doorstep of his new home in the base of a turreted rooftop tower designed in 1928 by Emery Roth to hide a wooden water tank at the Devonshire House, on East 10th Street and University Place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this month, Mr. McQuade signed a contract to pay just under $2.5 million for the tower apartment, after a bidding war and before the apartment was ever listed on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Devonshire House, a 130-unit building, was sold to a group of developers in December 2007, and is being converted to a condominium. The new owners are renovating and restoring the building, working around 52 rent-regulated tenants who still live there. The remaining apartments have been combined into 49 larger ones. With large units in short supply in Greenwich Village, buyers have signed contracts on 14 of them since marketing began in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McQuade is the chief executive of Voltaic Systems, a company that manufactures bags with solar panels on the outside, and storage batteries on the inside with enough juice to charge everything from an iPod to a personal computer, depending on the model. Peace Corps volunteers and staff members at the United Nations are big buyers, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the exotic product, with its scent of the sun-swept wilderness, Mr. McQuade, a former management consultant and high-tech executive, has lived in Manhattan since the early 1990s, when he came to New York from Australia to study business at Columbia. He lives down the street from the Devonshire House and learned about the tower space when he wandered into the building one day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tower is roughly 20 by 20 feet on the outside, with a 15-foot-high ceiling. An extension built some years ago adds a bedroom and bath to create an 1,100-square-foot space with an open kitchen, a full bath and a powder room. The turret room is dominated by four 9-foot-high arched windows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The developers planned to hold the tower unit off the market until after the apartments downstairs had sold, but Mr. McQuade pressed them to act sooner. The developers at Devonshire House agreed to negotiate. ''He was relentless in wanting that apartment,'' said Susan Hewitt, the project's lead developer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while Mr. McQuade was discussing the details of the renovation, another buyer offered to buy the tower as raw space, as is, without a $400,000 renovation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McQuade won the apartment after he, too, agreed to take the space raw, for close to the asking price. He is still in negotiations to have the developers carry out the renovation as well, at an additional charge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the roof can't support an environmentally fashionable planted green roof, Mr. McQuade said he would install a garden in pots, a pergola, and space for testing new solar devices as well. And reaching the unit will require a bit of backpacking: it is up a flight of stairs from the last stop on the elevator.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EVERY day, thousands of motorists tear through Union Township, using Interstate 78, Route 22 or the Garden State Parkway, to get someplace else, fast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there are people like Al and JoAnn Cernadas, who are having a hard time leaving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seven years ago, Mr. Cernadas, the first assistant prosecutor for Union County, and his wife paid $235,000 for a three-bedroom split-level house built in 1960 on a quiet street in the Battle Hill neighborhood. They poured in another $175,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We remodeled the whole thing and gutted it to the studs,'' Mrs. Cernadas said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cernadas was born and raised in the township and graduated from Union High School, and both dearly wanted to stay. But because of an illness in the family, they have spent the last year weighing whether to move away. They first put their house on the market last year, receiving two offers within a month but turning both down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now they have definitively made the decision to leave, and the house, which has a renovated kitchen, has been listed at $574,900. They will miss an old-fashioned downtown that still plays host to an annual St. Patrick's Day parade; they will also miss Union's convenience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have a bittersweet feeling,'' Mr. Cernadas said. ''It is so centrally located. It's all there, in this one town. You don't have to go anywhere else.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 57,000 people -- 58 percent white, 27 percent black -- live in Union, a nine-square-mile oblong that is home to Kean University, and not to be confused with Union, Hunterdon County; Union City, Hudson County; or Union Beach, Monmouth County.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The population is socioeconomically diverse, but becoming more white-collar. About the time the Cernadases moved into their house in 2002, a <span class="companylink">New Jersey Transit</span> station on the Raritan Valley Line opened near the Kean main campus, on the eastern edge of town.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now commuters must change trains at Pennsylvania Station in Newark for the ride into New York. But a new tunnel will provide direct service to New York by 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frank Bradley, the township administrator, projects an increase in housing stock. ''We see that as a great economic stimulus,'' Mr. Bradley said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year ago, Money magazine ranked Union as the 75th-best small city in America to live. Many of its residents tend to stay, and many natives, like Mr. Cernadas, move away and come back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One selling point is that houses are generally less expensive than in such surrounding towns as Maplewood, Springfield and Millburn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Constance Hellhake, an agent with Re/Max Properties, based in Summit, said of a house in Union that ''if it would be anywhere else but Union, it would be $100,000 higher.'' Even tax bills tend to be lower than those in nearby counties like Essex. That said, however, Union Township neighborhoods are somewhat less pristine than those in nearby towns, which brokers say accounts for the price differential.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michelle Pais, a Union native who is an agent for Coldwell Banker, put it this way: ''Union is a lot more affordable, and with the economy being what it is, you can buy more house for your money. And a lot of these residents have been here for years. It's not a town that has constantly turned over.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT YOU'LL FIND</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Union Township is less than 20 miles west of Lower Manhattan. Interstate 78, wide and usually fast, and Route 22, a six-lane thoroughfare that includes almost every chain store imaginable, run east and west and divide the township roughly into thirds. The Garden State Parkway runs north-south through the eastern end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To the north of I-78 is the Union neighborhood of Vauxhall, which abuts Maplewood and Essex County. The main drag through Union is Route 82, Morris Avenue, which connects Springfield and points west to Elizabeth in the east.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morris Avenue is lined with an eclectic Jersey mix of diners, lumberyards, supermarkets and gas stations until it enters Union Center, the downtown area. Here, Morris Avenue divides -- the sidewalk is lined with flagpoles, each carrying an American flag -- and to the right looms Town Hall, a colonial brick building with white columns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Union Center is the site of a venerable old bank, as well as shops, pubs and restaurants, dominated by Italian but with options like Filipino. There are also a few vacant storefronts. And some residential streets are named to honor those who served in the military, Connecticut Farms Presbyterian Church, a stone building, is just south of the downtown area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rows of wood-frame and split-level houses stand close together on small lots with sidewalks; the general effect is tidy. ''It's extremely quiet,'' Mrs. Cernadas said. ''And I am so going to miss the convenience here.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT YOU'LL PAY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent look at the Garden State Municipal Listing Service (gsmls.com) showed 256 residential properties for sale, ranging from a one-bedroom condominium available through an estate sale for $114,900, to a two-year-old five-bedroom brick colonial for $695,000. The annual tax bill for the latter is $9,719.Nearly half of the properties for sale are listed at $250,000 to $350,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September, Doug and Carol Denton, longtime residents of Union, listed Mrs. Denton's mother's three-bedroom one-and-a-half-bath Cape Cod for $275,000. The house in the northeast corner of town, which Mrs. Denton's parents bought new about 50 years ago, sold the next day for $270,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Basically, the people who bought it don't have to do anything but change the paint,'' said Mr. Denton, a former ironworker who works for the township's Department of Public Works.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to figures compiled by the township's tax assessor's office, 333 houses sold in Union in 2008 for an average of $312,000. In 2007, 474 houses sold in Union for an average of $350,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Trulia.com, a real estate search site, the median sale price in Union Township between September and November was $294,900, or 1.7 percent lower than the median price during the corresponding period in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE SCHOOLS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The system has five schools for prekindergarten through Grade 4, with the Jefferson School for Grade 5. Burnet and Kawameeh Middle Schools are for Grades 6, 7 and 8; Union High School has about 2,500 students enrolled in Grades 9 through 12.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAT averages last year were 463 in math, 450 in reading and 444 in writing, versus 514, 492 and 494 statewide. The class of 2008 had a 98.4 percent graduation rate, versus 92.8 percent statewide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT TO DO</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Route 22 has plenty of chains, both for shopping and dining. In fact, name a fast-food or restaurant chain, and it is probably on 22. The high-end Mall at Short Hillsis about a 15-minute drive from the western edge. Many residents take advantage of Union's proximity to New York on the weekends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the eastern end is Kean University, a public institution with an undergraduate enrollment of about 11,000, and Liberty Hall Museum, which was built in 1772 as the home of William Livingston, New Jersey's first elected governor. The museum holds letters written by Thomas Jefferson and two centuries' worth of other artifacts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are a number of parks. Between the Kean campus and the city of Elizabeth is Phil Rizzuto Park, a small county-run area named after the former Yankees shortstop. The private Suburban Golf Club, with a course dating to 1922, is in the middle of town.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bradley says 900 children take part in the youth soccer program. There are also recreational programs for football, basketball and softball. Union High School, whose teams are known as the Farmers, is traditionally good in sports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE COMMUTE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The station, on the <span class="companylink">New Jersey Transit</span> Raritan Valley line, links New York-bound commuters to a transfer point at Newark's Penn Station. A monthly pass is $154. Eight trains make the 38- to 47-minute total trip to New York on weekdays from 5 to 9 a.m., and eight trains go to Union from 4 to 8 p.m.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are two permit parking lots near the train station, providing a total of about 450 spaces, with no waiting list. The fee is $180 for three months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additionally, <span class="companylink">New Jersey Transit</span> operates the No. 114 bus line from a stop at Morris and Stuyvesant Avenues to the Port Authority in Midtown. There are 22 buses between 5 and 9 a.m. that make only one other stop before going to New York. One-way trips take about 35 minutes; a monthly pass is $146.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE HISTORY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1961, a Newark group called the Four Lovers failed an audition at a cocktail lounge at a bowling alley in Union. The group decided to adopt the name of the bowling alley: the Four Seasons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Led by Frankie Valli, the Four Seasons were inducted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame in 1990 and inspired the Broadway play ''Jersey Boys.'' In 2008, West Chestnut Street was renamed Four Seasons Lane. The bowling alley has been torn down and is now a <span class="companylink">Costco</span> parking lot.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE holidays are sure to be bustling at the big five-bedroom four-bath Tudor at 61 Oak Ridge Avenue in Summit. The Donovan family's three grown sons will be home for Christmas with friends in tow; their pet Newfoundland, Bailey, will be joining in the fun as always; and potential buyers may be stopping by on a moment's notice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''She's a very organized woman,'' said the real estate agent for the house, Winnie Cavazini of Lois Schneider Realtor, about the female half of the couple selling the house, Ellen Donovan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I did some research that indicated the sooner, the better to get a house on the market -- beating the spring rush,'' Ms. Cavazini said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the house was listed in late October, and as December arrived, Mrs. Donovan proceeded to plan a traditional family Christmas, decorating elaborately as always, but this year adding a red velvet bow to the for-sale sign out front.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're getting good traffic,'' Ms. Cavazini said. ''This holiday season is actually a pretty good time to be buying or selling a house.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeffrey Otteau of the Otteau Valuation Group, a company that analyzes the residential market and advises brokerages, said his analysis of contract sales data through the first week of December showed that the sharp increase in the pace of sales that started in June was continuing unusually late in the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, the research indicated, far fewer sellers pulled their homes off the market going into the holiday season this year than in the five previous holiday seasons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are several probable reasons for these trends, the analyst said -- and various agents for buyers and sellers chimed in to support his reasoning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For one thing, the federal tax credit for home buyers, extended in November, has a new expiration date: April 30. To be eligible for up to $8,000 in credit on their federal income taxes, buyers must sign a contract by that date, and close by June 30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think it is clear the program will not be extended again,'' Mr. Otteau said. If mortgage interest rates stay low -- in the 5.5 percent range -- he is predicting a ''frenzy'' of sales in the early spring, spurred by the expiring stimulus program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some buyers and sellers are already ''feeling the pressure'' of the looming expiration date, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile prices are still declining, or at least stuck at a low point, in most communities around the state. ''There is fantastic motivation for buyers to act now,'' Mr. Otteau said. ''And I think more sellers are realizing that it doesn't benefit them to wait until spring to put the house on the market, because they will not gain the advantage of a higher selling price.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Additionally, many sellers are marketing their homes through the holidays because they ''more or less have to, compelled by economic urgencies,'' said Ken Baris, an agent with Jordan Baris Inc. in West Orange.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Otteau estimates that a quarter of recent sales in New Jersey involve financial ''distress'' -- including short sales and foreclosure sales, and the sales of homes on which mortgage payments have been missed. The most recent data from the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> put the figure as high as 40 percent in some states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On top of all those general factors, there are personal motives pushing individual buyers and sellers into the marketplace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Donovans of Summit have bought a second home in northern Michigan, where they would like to retire, now that their sons are all in, or done with, college.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kristi Rott of Little Falls, who three years ago joined a friend in spending $449,000 on what she described as a ''fairy tale-style'' cottage on the edge of a nature preserve, is looking to sell now because the friend has relocated to the Midwest for a new job. Her agent, Roberta Baldwin of Re/Max Village Square in Montclair, said it was now for sale, dressed up in Ms. Rott's fanciful holiday decor, for $444,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christy Coutinho is both a buyer and a would-be seller this Christmastime: She and husband, David, are having a friend show up to play Santa for their two young sons at their new house on Glenview Drive in South Orange, although it will still be empty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It certainly isn't the ideal time to be doing this,'' Mrs. Coutinho said, ''but, hey, we found a house we really liked, with the perfect yard for the boys,'' who are 4 and 7.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both of the Coutinhos work in the financial services industry in Manhattan. They held onto their jobs during the ''storm on Wall Street,'' as she put it, and decided the time was right to buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At their current home, at 426 Harding Drive, also in South Orange, the Coutinhos are trying to ''walk the line between having the house ready for the holidays and keeping things neat.'' They have listed the house with Cherre Schwartz, an agent at <span class="companylink">Weichert Realtors</span>, for $699,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My sons' automated sleigh that plays an obnoxiously loud Christmas carol is perhaps not the sophisticated look we are going for when buyers come by,'' Mrs. Coutinho said. ''But this is the way things worked out for us -- and hopefully some buyer will find this the perfect time on their end.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ayal Steinberg, who lives with his wife and baby in Manhattan, is in the market for a four- or five-bedroom home in North Jersey, probably in Livingston or North Caldwell. He said he found the inventory of homes for sale ''picked over, and bottom of the barrel,'' and wished that more were being listed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Otteau's statistics show the ''pickings'' to be more ample than usual at this time of year. Each year for the last six, his statistical records show, the number of homes on the market as of Dec. 1 was significantly lower than in the preceding months. This year, the decline in the number on the market was only 4 percent statewide, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the number of sales has been surging well ahead of last year's pace in every month since June, and appeared to be continuing to do so at the start of December, he said. For instance in October, the pace was 55 percent above that of the previous October. He called this a ''healthy and very unusual surge going into late fall.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BUYING real estate in Boulder, Colo., which sits at an elevation of 5,430 feet where the Rocky Mountains meet the Great Plains, guarantees more than great views. It also promises that those views will be available for a very long time. Controlled urban growth is serious business in this city of just over 100,000. You won't find housing developments creeping up the hillsides. And thanks to four-story height restrictions, you won't find towers competing with the peaks. Even from downtown you can look out on the tens of thousands of acres of open space, conservation easements and nature preserves that surround the city. And about one quarter of the city's sales tax and use tax go toward protecting even more open space. Should you be inclined, you can be hiking, biking or walking through those views in minutes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate agents say there is an influx of second-home owners who put a premium on the natural environment. At a downtown condominium called the Walnut, for example, about half the buyers are second-home owners who like having a short walk or bike ride to the great outdoors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retirees seeking city amenities in a wilderness setting are looking to Boulder too. ''It's not just the lifestyle here -- people want the lower taxes too,'' said John McElveen, a broker associate with Re/Max of Boulder. ''We see a lot of Californians and buyers from the Northeast.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pearl Street Mall, a four-block pedestrian promenade and social hub in Boulder, features restaurants, stores, offices and galleries. And the University of Colorado, Boulder, with more than 30,000 students, is within walking distance of downtown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This city has a mild climate and historically has about 300 sunny days a year. For those who care even remotely about fitness, extensive trail systems make it almost impossible to escape staying in shape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condominiums downtown and nearby range from $250,000 for a 900-square-foot one-bedroom unit in a 1980s building to $6 million for a 5,200-square-foot luxury penthouse. But most high-end condominiums cluster in the $1 million to $2.5 million range, and newer entry-level units downtown start at about $400,000.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SYRACUSE -- Standing on the windblown rooftop of a twisty glass building here, Ed Bogucz waved one arm toward the downtown skyline and the other toward a neighborhood of abandoned houses and vacant lots where he is investing in green-home technology. The whole area, he said, is a laboratory. ''The thing about Syracuse is that it's at a great scale,'' he said. ''It's big enough to have density and small enough that you can study the whole thing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bogucz's organization, the Syracuse Center of Excellence, has teamed with the Syracuse University School of Architecture and a local nonprofit developer called Home HeadQuarters in a unusual real estate experiment. The center, one of six founded within the last decade by the state under former Gov. George E. Pataki to nurture promising industries in college towns, is investing in companies that use less fossil fuel in building affordable homes, outfitting them and supplying them with energy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The center will soon move from an office park into the five-story building where Mr. Bogucz was standing, where it will monitor demonstration technologies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The architecture school, meanwhile, is leading a project to put some of those technologies into effect in the Near West Side, a dilapidated neighborhood near downtown, where construction has begun on homes that emit almost no carbon and cost less than $150,000 to build. Three such homes, already in contract, should be complete by summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bogucz, who pronounces his name BO-gish, said that after distributing $200 million in public money to dozens of green building companies since its founding, the center is currently monitoring many awards and $5 million in grants for start-ups. ''It's the ultimate in patient capital,'' he said, ''and Syracuse is at the forefront of sustainability.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In homes under construction on the Near West Side, two pilot companies are working at opposite ends of a house's life. One is e2e Materials, an Ithaca company that makes particleboard and walls from soy flour and fibers of natural grasslike materials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By buying the flour left over from soy production and using perennial supplies of lightweight fibers rather than diminishing stocks of lumber, e2e can significantly lower the amount of dedicated energy it takes to construct a house, according to the company's chief executive, Patrick Govang. This avoided fuel use, Mr. Govang added, means that, over time, e2e's product will generate significantly fewer carbon emissions than wood. The company also recently started trying to grow flax within the state, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Govang has run the company since it was spun off a Cornell University experiment in fiber design in 2007. He said the latest iteration of e2e's material, which he plans to produce in standard four- by eight-foot sizes by spring, could go into walls and floors. ''A typical floor system in a home costs about $24 per square foot,'' he said. His company expects to sell at half that price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But e2e has not yet achieved economies of scale in its manufacturing, and it is relying on the Center of Excellence to cover the gap between what it charges and what clients can pay. (The center has also paid to use e2e materials to make the reception desk at its new headquarters.).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other business working in the Near West Side with the center's support faces no shortage of raw material. Northeast Natural Homes, a father and son outfit, competes with demolition contractors by ''deconstructing'' old homes, one plank at a time, rather than razing them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company then resells the lumber for new building projects. The father, Kevin Stack, said that he had trained 16 people to pull 12,100 pounds of lumber from a little 89-year-old house on the Near West Side, all of it stronger and more reliably usable than lumber from a distributor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These two companies see huge market opportunities once they can achieve economies of scale. Mr. Govang pointed out that his material's protein made it a natural fire retardant, rendering formaldehyde unnecessary. And he said that by growing fibers regionally, as he hopes to do soon with help from government sources, he would continually replenish the supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stack said that in cities like Buffalo and Flint, Mich., with thousands of abandoned homes, deconstruction could compete with traditional demolition. ''You could say this is all stored carbon that would go into a landfill,'' he said. If the United States adopts a cap on carbon emissions, he argued, home builders could buy salvaged lumber and then sell the right to emit the amount of carbon that would have burned if the lumber had gone into a landfill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stack's son, Josh, sees plenty of opportunity in his hometown. ''There are 1,450 abandoned homes in Syracuse,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of Northeast Natural Homes' lumber will go into one of the new houses that the architecture school has nurtured. Developed by Home HeadQuarters, which has renovated homes in the neighborhood for decades, these houses will be compact and offer reconfigurable interiors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The one using Northeast Natural Homes' recovered lumber, designed by the New York architecture firm of Cook &amp; Fox, will feature elaborate dividers that serve as movable walls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bogucz is negotiating to reach a price at which e2e's material can go into the house's movable walls, given the architecture school's mandate that the house cost less than $150,000 to build.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though the houses are selling at low prices, they show high ambition. In another experiment, two New York architecture firms -- Architecture Research Office and Della Valle Bernheimer -- have designed a home to meet a standard called Passivhaus, which requires a building exterior so airtight that residents hardly need to use boilers or air-conditioners. Jared Della Valle, a partner in Della Valle Bernheimer, described it as sealing in heat and cool, ''like a sheep.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bogucz, a trained engineer, has also invested in demonstrations of systems that use excess heat from electricity or water to heat homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Champions of the Syracuse experiments know that most people associate their city with industrial decline and urban emptiness. But Mr. Bogucz said his investments could change that. Noting how the fledgling e2e had impressed Cook &amp; Fox, Mr. Bogucz made a prediction. ''Within five years, I expect e2e will have annual revenues of several hundred million dollars and several hundred employees,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also predicts that 50 full-time deconstruction experts will be at work by 2015 -- because old houses will still outnumber new ones for a while.</p>

</div><div class="author">By MANNY FERNANDEZ   </div><div>620 words</div><div>15 December 2009</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>34</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York City housing officials and the real estate company that plans to transform the West Side railyards into a high-rise residential and business district have agreed to preserve hundreds of apartments near the site as affordable dwellings for low- and middle-income New Yorkers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agreement calls for 551 apartments that are owned by the developer, the Related Companies, or will be acquired by the city, in the area surrounding the 26-acre railyards to remain at those affordable rents, many of them permanently. Rent protections at other development projects often expire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Related and the city had already pledged to build 743 new below-market-rate apartments as part of the project -- 431 out of roughly 5,000 residential units that Related plans at the railyards complex and 312 more to be developed by the city nearby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the units are intended for families earning no more than 80 percent of the median household income in the city -- roughly $61,000 for a four-person household under federal guidelines. The agreement, part of a rezoning plan, came about after negotiations between Related and the mayor's office, city housing officials, community activists and City Council leaders, including the Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, who had made the creation of housing for low- and middle-income families a priority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Development plans at the railyards have had a long, rocky history. In 2005, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg suffered a blow to his agenda when plans to build a football stadium for the Jets there fell apart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a very significant victory for the West Side, to see a plan move forward for the western railyards, a plan that does not include football, and a plan that does include affordable housing,'' Ms. Quinn said at a news conference Monday at City Hall after the rezoning was approved by the Council's zoning subcommittee and its land use committee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city expanded its commitment to preserve affordable housing units in the area as a way to achieve the mayor's overall goals of redeveloping the West Side and financing 165,000 units of affordable housing throughout the five boroughs. It had the effect of ensuring that the rezoning received broad support from elected officials and community leaders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This isn't just a specific project,'' said the deputy mayor for economic development, Robert C. Lieber. ''It's really about building out an overall community.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The relatively smooth approval of the plan by the two Council committees was in stark contrast to another closely watched Related project that the committees took up Monday and ultimately struck down: the redevelopment of the Kingsbridge Armory in the Bronx into a shopping mall. The rezoning plan for the railyards now heads to the City Planning Commission and then goes before the full Council for final approval next week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We were happy to be able to come up with a menu of affordable options that worked from everybody's point of view,'' said Jay Cross, president of Related Hudson Yards, the joint venture between Related and <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>, that is developing the site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $15 billion railyards project will transform the largest undeveloped site left in Manhattan into a high-rise enclave with 12 million square feet of office towers, apartment buildings, a hotel, parks and retail businesses. The 26-acre railyards, owned by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, sit on both sides of 11th Avenue between 30th and 33rd Streets, near the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a $1.054 billion deal last May, Stephen M. Ross, chief executive of Related, signed an agreement with the transportation authority to develop the site.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Imagine that Jeffrey R. Immelt, chief executive of <span class="companylink">General Electric</span>, could remake the conglomerate's troubled finance unit, <span class="companylink">GE Capital</span>, from scratch. Ideally he would narrow its focus to businesses related to G.E.'s core industrial strengths -- and the size of its balance sheet to about $360 billion in assets. Imagining, though, illustrates just how difficult it will be to tame <span class="companylink">GE Capital</span> to a manageable size.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Immelt has already taken out the hatchet. But his aim of chopping <span class="companylink">GE Capital</span>'s balance sheet down from $631 billion, by about a quarter across most areas, is going to take time. He has 2012 in his sights to achieve this ambition -- something he is likely to reiterate at his annual investor presentation Tuesday. That could seem an eternity to investors who have seen the company's market value shrink by more than $240 billion since the credit crisis erupted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If it were possible for Mr. Immelt to hit the reset button on <span class="companylink">GE Capital</span>, it is not difficult to see what would disappear first: commercial real estate. The market for office properties and securities is in a shambles, and <span class="companylink">GE Capital</span>, as both lender and landlord, is heavily exposed. The company recently raised to $7 billion its estimate of unrealized losses on underwater properties. The trouble is that most experts predict that asset values for everything from apartment buildings to skyscrapers have further to fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A <span class="companylink">GE Capital</span> without its current real estate portfolio would be $78 billion lighter in assets, according to the company's latest quarterly filing. There would also be other benefits. The company would save the incalculable management hours needed to clean up the current mess. It would also help simplify <span class="companylink">GE Capital</span>'s portfolio, helping to woo back G.E.'s stock investors who have been turned off by the finance unit's complexity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an ideal world, G.E. could just accelerate a sale of its real estate assets. But because property values have cratered, dumping them into the market would require the company to take big losses for which it has not set aside a corresponding amount of capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer lending, which includes financing for credit cards that shoppers get from their favorite retailers and mortgages, would be the logical next piece of <span class="companylink">GE Capital</span> to go. While these businesses might have grown out of G.E.'s former desire to finance appliance purchases, it's not clear how they are core to the company's global industrial reach today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet this segment takes up $136 billion of the balance sheet. Take this out along with commercial real estate and <span class="companylink">GE Capital</span>'s assets shrink to $416 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, there's the cash cushion G.E. has built up to reassure investors it has enough liquid assets on hand should borrowing in credit markets seize up again or losses prove steeper than expected. That liquidity luxury stood at $56 billion at the end of the third quarter. Without that, the balance sheet would be down to about $360 billion, though some portion of that cash would still probably be needed in a slimmed-down <span class="companylink">GE Capital</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even after winnowing down <span class="companylink">GE Capital</span> in this imaginary exercise, the group would still have a $146 billion commercial lending and leasing arm, a business that G.E. has been in for more than a quarter of a century. This operation is where G.E. built its reputation as an expert in assessing the value and risks of collateral backing a broad array of loans, and isn't far off from its business of financing customers of the conglomerate's leading manufacturing activities, from jet engines to hospital equipment to energy turbines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though not a perfect match with its parent's business lines, that would be a much better starting point than today's balance sheet, which is bogged down by assets that are difficult to value, hard to unload and of little interest to investors seeking exposure to G.E.'s world-class global infrastructure business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, fantasyland thinking goes only so far. Even if <span class="companylink">GE Capital</span> could shrink overnight by more than 40 percent, that doesn't mean it would escape what is sure to be a longer reach by regulators looking to protect the financial system. A <span class="companylink">GE Capital</span> with a $360 billion balance sheet would still be too big to fail.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Larry Sultan, California Photographer, Is Dead at 63</span>
</div><div class="author">By RANDY KENNEDY   </div><div>984 words</div><div>14 December 2009</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>29</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2009 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Larry Sultan, a highly influential California photographer whose 1977 collaboration, ''Evidence'' -- a book made up solely of pictures culled from vast industrial and government archives -- became a watershed in the history of art photography, died on Sunday at his home in Greenbrae, Calif. He was 63.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cause was cancer, said his wife, Katherine, who is known as Kelly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the mid 1970s using a grant and a letter of introduction from the National Endowment for the Arts, Mr. Sultan and Mike Mandel, who had met as students at the San Francisco Art Institute, somehow managed to persuade several large companies, agencies and research institutions like the <span class="companylink">Bechtel Corporation</span>, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the San Jose Police Department and the United States Department of the Interior to let them rummage through their documentary photo files.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Highly influenced by the West Coast brand of Conceptualism then percolating out of places like the California Institute of the Arts, both men were interested, as Mr. Mandel later said, in exploring photography as ''more than just the modernist practice of fine-tuning your style and way of seeing.'' The pictures they chose from the archives, out of the hundreds of thousands they examined, were a strange, stark, sometimes disturbing vision of a late-industrial world: a space-suited figure sprawled face down on a carpeted floor; a car consumed in flames; a man holding up a tangle of weeds like a trophy; a shaved monkey being held down by a gloved hand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the images seemed to have been picked for their uncanny resemblance to installation art being made at the time. But the 59 photos published, with no captions to explain what they showed or where they came from, pursued a much broader, Duchampian agenda of harnessing found photographs for the purposes of art while using them as a way to examine the society that produced them. The critic Kenneth Baker of The San Francisco Chronicle wrote that the project demonstrated brilliantly the degree to which ''we have no calculus to unravel relations between what a picture shows and what it explains.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with other artwork using vernacular photographs, like that of Michael Lesy in his book ''Wisconsin Death Trip'' and of Richard Prince, the project, first shown at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, opened broad new avenues for photography that have since been explored by major museums and by artists like Christian Boltanski and Carrie Mae Weems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Born in Brooklyn, Mr. Sultan was raised mostly in Los Angeles, where his family moved when he was an infant and where his father worked as a traveling salesman and later as a vice president for the Schick Safety Razor Company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not initially interested in photography, Mr. Sultan studied political science at the University of California at Santa Barbara and later earned a master's degree in fine arts from the San Francisco Art Institute. Before he and Mr. Mandel began working on ''Evidence,'' they collaborated on another project in which they bought space on billboards around Los Angeles and posted traffic-slowing Dada-esque messages. One bore the announcement ''Oranges on Fire,'' and showed two cartoonish arms holding a bunch of flaming oranges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For more than a decade beginning in the early 1980s, Mr. Sultan, who became a professor at the California College of the Arts in San Francisco, worked on a project about his mother and his father, who had been forced into early retirement. Using stills from home movies along with lush, colored-saturated pictures he took of his parents, the resulting book, ''Pictures From Home,'' was a deeply personal document but one that continued Mr. Sultan's lifelong mission of exploring photography's fictions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sultan's father, Irving, speaking of a picture of himself in a suit sitting on the edge of a bed with a vacant stare on his face, related how his son had instructed him not to smile and had created a portrait that the elder Mr. Sultan felt was much more about the photographer than the photographed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'' 'Any time you show that picture,' '' Mr. Sultan said his father told him, '''you tell people that that's not me sitting on the bed looking all dressed up and nowhere to go, depressed. That's you sitting on the bed, and I am happy to help you with the project, but let's get things straight here.' '' His parents died not long after the work was completed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to his wife, Mr. Sultan is survived by two sons, Max and Will, both of Greenbrae; and two brothers, Michael, of Pacific Palisades, Calif., and Kenneth, of Santa Barbara.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 1990s, Mr. Sultan began to photograph in the San Fernando Valley, near when he went to high school, shooting suburban homes that were being rented as sets for pornographic movies. Sandra S. Phillips, the photography curator at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, said that while the work, called ''The Valley,'' was ''nominally about the industry of adult sexual fantasy, the true subject of Sultan's pictures is how photography is used in the construction of that fantasy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Writing in LA Weekly about the work in 2004, Mr. Sultan observed of one particular set: ''The furnishings and objects in the house, which have been carefully arranged, become estranged from their intended function. The roll of paper towels on the coffee table, the bed linens in a pile by the door, the shoes under the bed are transformed into props or the residue of unseen but very imaginable actions. Even the piece of half-eaten pie on the kitchen counter arouses suspicion.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was early last year when Joby Morris, a 33-year-old floral designer in Pacifica, heard about the housing market's crash. Soon she and her fiance began dreaming of finally buying a home in the East Bay. But for 18 months, Ms. Morris watched helplessly as time and again, an investor with an all-cash offer and no intention of moving into the property swooped in and snapped up a house she was bidding on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, she entered a bidding war for a home at 2208 41st Avenue in Oakland. It was listed at $149,000; she bid until the price topped $180,000, her real estate agent said. The winning bid was $265,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, after the same thing happened a sixth time, Ms. Morris gave up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The idea of ownership was a falsehood,'' said Ms. Morris, who was planning to finance the purchase with a loan guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration. ''It's not going to happen.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Morris and her fiance, Justin Womack, with a combined income of more than $100,000, are among hundreds of qualified, aspiring homeowners in the Bay Area baffled and frustrated by the difficulties they face, local Realtors say. As Ms. Morris's Oakland-based real estate agent, Charles Wright, said, ''Everyday homeowner occupants are having a serious problem finding anything because there's such a frenzy out there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's happening in Oakland, the East Bay, Alameda County,'' Mr. Wright added. At least four of his clients recently bid on homes, only to be outbid by investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are, of course, winners as well as losers in the phenomenon. For existing homeowners, rising prices are not something to mourn. But it is frustrating for someone like Ms. Morris, who is qualified to buy most foreclosed homes at the offering prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The phenomenon is familiar to anyone who has watched a market swoon: vulture investing. Private investors have pooled cash and are buying foreclosed homes by the dozens in the Bay Area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the negative association with carrion-eating birds, some economists argue that opportunistic investing in depressed markets helps the economy by setting a floor price for devalued assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What would it look like if you didn't have these investors?'' asked James A. Angel, a business professor at Georgetown University. ''The banks would be stuck holding properties. The losses to the banking system would be so much more if you didn't have vultures.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes, Mr. Angel added, ''investors are helping reduce losses in the banking sector, and that means less stress on the taxpayer to support it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the process, Joby Morris and others like her are priced out of a market they otherwise could have afforded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barry Zigas, director of housing policy for Consumer Federation of America, said that as a consequence of the investment flurry, ''we've seen over and over again a common outcome is investors acquire these properties, put minimal repairs in them and rent them out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's been a longstanding history of advocacy to try to get there to be a priority to sell to owner occupants,'' Mr. Zigas said, ''but it's a really tough policy to get enacted when financial institutions in our society are faced with trying to recover as much money as they can and move on.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Washington, lawmakers like Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, are trying to give potential buyers more buying power by getting the Federal Housing Administration to guarantee larger loans with lower down payments in expensive markets like the Bay Area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a buyer with financing of any sort is still at a disadvantage when competing with an all-cash offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To the same end, <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, the government-created agency that buys pools of home loans, announced three weeks ago that when it put a foreclosed property on the market, it would consider offers only from ''owner occupants and buyers using public funds'' for the first 15 days. Offers from investors will be considered only afterward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jon Freeman, the chief executive of Stonecrest Financial, an investment firm based in San Jose, would not want to wait. He keeps a laser focus on getting foreclosed properties into the company's asset portfolio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are huge opportunities out there for those who have cash and guts and foresight,'' Mr. Freeman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using the industry term for properties that banks acquire through foreclosures, he said, ''Bulk R.E.O.'s -- that's the new buzzword right now.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, Mr. Freeman said, <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> sold him a package of 150 foreclosed homes scattered in low-income areas. He ticked off a few neighborhoods: ''A lot in Richmond, Antioch, Oakland, some in San Jose.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the recorder-clerk's office in Martinez, the Contra Costa County seat, Stonecrest Financial's funds are listed as buyers alongside smaller investors, like Mancheno Enterprises of Orinda.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of November, there were about 7,000 foreclosed properties of record -- and an unknown additional amount in undisclosed bank inventories, according to Matthew Anderson, a partner at Foresight Analytics. Stonecrest Financial, with an estimated $25 million in real estate assets at any given time, is one of the country's midsized players, which incessantly prod banks for new deals valued between $10 million and $20 million -- be it a package of 50 homes in the East Bay or 500 scattered throughout the Rust Belt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In markets like the Bay Area, the supply of foreclosed homes both for investors like Mr. Freeman and for ordinary buyers like Ms. Morris has been artificially suppressed by the banks that own them. In the months following the financial crisis, as federal bailout money relieved the urgent need for banks to liquidate their assets, lenders and government entities like <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span> curtailed sales to raise prices and avoid recording losses on the properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kerry Vandell, director of the Center for Real Estate at the University of California, Irvine, Paul Merage School of Business, said these investors often turned the homes into rental units for short-term gains before looking to sell them at a handsome profit within three to five years. These proliferating operations, big and small, and a low supply of available homes -- a counterintuitive consequence of the federal bailout of some banks -- combine to put pressure on many first-time home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With homes falling into the portfolios of investors instead of the hands of potential occupants, Professor Vandell said, communities are subtly scarred.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I get calls from concerned communities about this all the time,'' he said. ''You're going to have speculators there who will tend to walk away from the property or milk the property and not put any investment capital into it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, Professor Vandell added, ''the communities are afraid they'll rent to households of considerably lower income.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some investors, like Joshua Host, chief executive of Stone Equity Group, which is based in Southern California, argued that their work had ''a social component.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he makes package deals, paying $2 million to $5 million for 50 to 300 homes, Mr. Host said, ''it's not just a matter of buying these packages of foreclosures without improving them -- we're not just playing a paper game.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If buyers often unwittingly play the role of the demure ingenue in the market, their competitors thrive in a fast-talking world of high-stakes deal making and snap judgments made at local auctions in places like Martinez. The newer East Bay suburbs in Contra Costa and Solano Counties sustained extensive foreclosures. On Friday, despite rain, investors gathered on the steps of the county courthouse in Martinez at 10 a.m. to bid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tight supply has created a secondary industry of middlemen. Brokers interviewed last week said some of these promised access to property packages -- whether or not they had such access.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You wouldn't believe the number of guys running around telling me, 'My cousin or my cousin's cousin knows someone at the F.D.I.C.,' '' said Leonard McKines of J.P.L. Investments, a group based in Fremont that is raising $100 million to buy bulk foreclosures. ''This is the wild, wild West.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Too wild for Ms. Morris and Mr. Womack.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've been renting for 13 years, and we're getting married next month,'' she said last week. ''I'm from Connecticut, Justin's from Texas. But this is where we want to make our home. The next logical step having been paying for so long would've been to own something. It's not going to happen.''It's all been a waste of time and a waste of money.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From cheap ski resorts in New England, to cozy chalets in Aspen for under $150, a budget travel guide to 10 North American ski resorts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A full version of the Affordable Ski Guides -- including tips on lift tickets, where to eat, apres ski and where to shop -- can be found at nytimes.com/travel/skiing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ALTA</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Picture the thrifty consumer who buys only one new sweater every few years but spends good money on a quality one. That's the type of skier Alta attracts. For 70 years, the Utah resort has been known for its no-frills approach, letting the challenging terrain and abundant snow speak for itself. Though you won't find dirt-cheap hotels or lift tickets, Alta offers few temptations for spendthrifts. Hard-core skiers come here to ski (snowboarding is still verboten), not to ride fancy gondolas or blow their budgets at trendy boutiques or aromatherapy spas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOW TO GET THERE The Salt Lake City airport is 33 miles away, which means there are plenty of cheap flights to choose from, especially on Delta, which uses the airport as a hub. From New York, Delta, Continental and <span class="companylink">JetBlue</span> are among the airlines offering nonstop flights; a recent Web search turned up round-trip fares starting at around $270 for travel in late January. There's no need for a rental car in Alta because everything is within an easy walk. Alta Shuttle (866-274-0225; www.altashuttle.com[http://www.altashuttle.com]) offers regular van service from the airport for $32 each way. There are also free buses between Alta and neighboring Snowbird.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHERE TO STAY Alta's five small base-area lodges have their own distinct personalities and fiercely loyal clientele. Each of the lodges also offers lower-priced dorms and rooms with shared baths. Ski-in, ski-out dorms are rare at other resorts . Even rarer, the lodges are very social -- most have communal dining tables -- so that solo skiers won't feel out of place. If that weren't enough, lavish breakfasts and dinners are included in the basic rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the friendliest is the 57-room Alta Lodge (10230 East Route 210; 800-707-2582; www.altalodge.com[http://www.altalodge.com]). Built in 1939, it has a split personality: rustic, knotty-pine rooms in the original section; spare, midcentury-modern decor in the newer wing. Four gender-specific dorms, which sleep up to four, start at $133 a person and include breakfast, afternoon tea and a four-course dinner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The oldest and smallest lodge, the 18-room Snowpine (10400 East Route 210; 801-742-2000; www.thesnowpine.com[http://www.thesnowpine.com]), is also the cheapest. Built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1938, the lodge offers a hodgepodge decor of granite walls, pine accents and electric blue chairs. There is also a sauna and outdoor hot tub. A bunk in the gender-specific dorm rooms is $105, including breakfast and a four-course dinner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">True penny-pinchers can always stay in or around Salt Lake City, which has plenty of budget motels. A Studio 6, the extended-stay version of Motel 6 (975 East 6600 South, Murray; 801-685-2102; www.staystudio6.com[http://www.staystudio6.com]), has a room with queen-size bed and kitchen for $53. CINDY HIRSCHFELD</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ASPEN</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aspen may be known for its glitz and fur-trimmed ski boots, but with even celebrities pinching pennies these days, there are surprisingly affordable ways this winter to schuss down the Little Nell run and nibble on oysters and truffle fries at Ajax Tavern. Indeed, a lot of bargains await, including the lowest airfares in more than two decades and plenty of freebies like lift tickets and lodging for kids. So while a membership to the Caribou Club may be out of reach for many, Aspen's four champagne-powder mountains aren't.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOW TO GET THERE Flying into Aspen (with a plane change in Denver) from New York City just got cheaper thanks to Frontier, which began competing with United and Delta on that route in 2008. A recent Web search showed round-trip flights on Frontier from La Guardia Airport starting at $320 for travel in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's no need to rent a car in Aspen, as almost everything downtown is walking distance. Besides, parking is a big headache. Many hotels offer transport from the airport. Otherwise, free buses run into town twice an hour (970-925-8484; www.rfta.com[http://www.rfta.com]). WHERE TO STAY Aspen's charm comes partly from its architecture, including a smattering of unpretentious 1970s-style lodges that didn't cash out during the real estate boom. One of the most nostalgic is the St. Moritz Lodge (334 West Hyman Avenue; 970-925-3220; www.stmoritzlodge.com[http://www.stmoritzlodge.com]), which, as its name suggests, looks like an Americanized version of a Swiss chalet, with knotty gray walls and bright blue trim. The lodge has 36 rooms: the cheapest, a hostel-style room with three twin beds and a shared bath, starts at $39. Private rooms with double beds, flat-screen TV and private bathrooms start at $99. There is also a small white-tiled steam room and an outdoor heated pool with Jacuzzi jets that is surrounded by purple plum trees and a killer view.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as cozy is the Mountain House Lodge (905 East Hopkins Avenue; 970-920-2550; www.mountainhouselodge.com[http://www.mountainhouselodge.com]), established in 1973 in a putty-colored building along the town's eastern edge. While the 26 rooms aren't exactly the height of fashion -- artificial flowers, blond wooden furniture and eggplant-purple curtains -- they are bright and clean. They start at $89 for a small bunkroom with two twin beds and a private bathroom, and $159 for a double. There's also an outdoor hot tub, Wi-Fi and apres-ski wine-and-cheese receptions twice a week.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JACKSON HOLE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Winter is actually the off-season in Jackson Hole -- hard to believe when you consider the insane powder dumps and the 4,139 vertical feet of terrain that expert skiers come to conquer year after year. But the happy result for winter visitors is a glut of moderately priced hotels in the town of Jackson, 12 miles from the mountain. Add airfare sales and the ski-and-stay deals in the base area's Teton Village, and a trip to Jackson Hole can be more than worthwhile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOW TO GET THERE The most expensive part about a Jackson Hole vacation is often the flight, so if you can get cheap airfare, the rest is a breeze. You'll have the best luck if you're flexible, patient or both -- that is, willing to fly in the early morning and make at least one stop. A recent Web search turned up fares starting at $220 on Delta for flights from New York in January, usually connecting through Salt Lake City. Most flights with less onerous conditions cost more than $300. This year, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, and Salt Lake City all have direct air access and increased routes. Check Jackson Hole's Web site (www.jacksonhole.com[http://www.jacksonhole.com]) for specials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're staying in the town of Jackson, you'll want to rent a car.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHERE TO STAY Good deals are offered by just about every hotel in Teton Village, where mountain access is easiest and the trek minimal. But those who want to spend less on lodging may want to stay in Jackson itself -- though you'll have to drive to the slopes, prices tend to be lower and there are more colorful shops, restaurants, galleries and bars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the base of the mountain is the LEED-certified Hotel Terra (3335 West Village Drive, Teton Village; 800-631-6281; www.hotelterrajacksonhole.com[http://www.hotelterrajacksonhole.com]). Rooms have gas fireplaces, low-flow water fixtures and free Wi-Fi. The hotel also has a rooftop hot tub, spa and a new heated infinity pool. Though room rates start at $229, deals offered through its Web site can bring the price down significantly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Jackson, Alpine House(285 North Glenwood Street; 307-739-1570; www.alpinehouse.com[http://www.alpinehouse.com]) is an upscale 22-room B &amp; B that starts at $135 a night, including an organic breakfast buffet. It's just a few blocks from the historic town square and the popular Million Dollar Cowboy Bar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the Quality 49er Inn and Suites (330 West Pearl Street, Jackson; 307-733-7550; www.qualityinn.com[http://www.qualityinn.com]) has a mountain feel, with leather armchairs and gas fireplaces, from $66 a night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BONNIE TSUI</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JAY PEAK</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jay Peak really isn't close to anything except the Canadian border, about 10 miles away. But those who make the trek to this Vermont resort are handsomely rewarded with short lines, ticket deals and tons of snow. Jay averages 355 inches of snow, one of the biggest snowfalls in the East, and it blankets some of the most extensive glades skiing in the region, drawing serious skiers with its challenging chutes and very generous outbound policy. And with little in the way of night life or amenities, Jay isn't the place to come for pampering or dance parties, but no one minds -- there's too much snow to play in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOW TO GET THERE Jay is about 70 miles from the Burlington airport, and about 80 miles from the Montreal airport, and an easy six-and-a-half-hour drive from New York City. Delta and <span class="companylink">JetBlue</span> fly direct to Burlington from Kennedy Airport; Continental from Newark; and <span class="companylink">USAir</span> and United from LaGuardia. Round-trip flights at the end of January were $199 on all airlines. Flights to Montreal start at $321 for the same time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHERE TO STAY Jay is expanding its lodging and facilities, so for now, some of the best deals are off the mountain in apartments, inns and lodges scattered in nearby towns including Jay, Montgomery and Troy. The Four Seasons Vacation Apartments (10 Elm Street, North Troy;; 802-578-7103; www.jaypeakskiing.com/elm[http://www.jaypeakskiing.com/elm]) is a no-frills complex about a 15-minute drive from the mountain. Apartments start from $30 a person based on four-person occupancy, and renters can buy discounted lift tickets for $49 ($85 for two days).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're looking to relive your frat-house days, Grampa Grunt's Lodge (53 Begnoche Road; Montgomery Center; 802-326-4572; www.grampagrunts.com[http://www.grampagrunts.com]) is the perfect place. For $33 a night, the hostel-like lodge offers tiny bunk beds and a communal bar where there always is bound to be a party. Kick in an extra $5 for the all-you-can eat breakfast of omelets, waffles, pancakes and bacon prepared by Grampa (yes, he does exist). Apartments are also available for $180 to $250 a night, depending on the size.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For something a little closer and grown-up, the Inglenook Lodge (Route 242, Jay; 800-331-4346; www.inglenookvermont.com[http://www.inglenookvermont.com]) is a German-style lodge next to the mountain. For $149 a person, skiers get a night of lodging, a lift ticket, breakfast and a dinner in the lodge's schnitzel-and bratwurst-heavy restaurant. KATIE ZEZIMA</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REVELSTOKE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revelstoke Mountain Resort, a new ski area in British Columbia, boasts North America's highest descent, its own helipad for high-rollers and a cluster of luxury condos. But long before the ski resort (www.revelstokemountainresort.com[http://www.revelstokemountainresort.com]) officially opened in 2007, the region was primarily a haven for bushy-bearded snowmobilers and blue-collar rail workers, which means that Revelstoke is still teeming with cheap motor lodges and affordable Victorian inns. And with Olympic mania hitting British Columbia, there are discounted flights aplenty to be found this winter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOW TO GET THERE Revelstoke is not easy to get to for New Yorkers. The closest major airport is Kelowna International, about a two-hour drive from the resort through the Selkirk Mountains. From the New York City area, the cheapest flight is often on Alaska Airlines (www.alaskaair.com[http://www.alaskaair.com]), flying out of Newark with a stopover in Seattle. A recent Web search pulled up round-trip fares starting at about $400 in January. A rental car is recommended. A cheaper but longer option is to fly into Vancouver and drive six hours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHERE TO STAY The town of Revelstoke, about a 10-minute drive from the mountain base, still betrays its blue-collar roots, with plenty of no-frills motels, run-down cafeterias and rusty pickups. The dollar goes far here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Revelstoke Lodge (61 First Street West; 888-559-1979; www.revelstokelodge.com[http://www.revelstokelodge.com]), near the center of town, is a recently renovated motel, with a fire-engine-red exterior and a helpful staff that caters mostly to snowmobilers and the occasional skier. Doubles start at 99 Canadian dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A homier option, nestled along the banks of the Columbia River with sweeping views of snowcapped Mount Begbie, is the Inn on the River(250-837-3262; www.innontheriverbc.com[http://www.innontheriverbc.com]). Private suites with kitchenettes start at $150. The owners are gracious and will sometimes invite guests for free barbecue dinners. LIONEL BEEHNER</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOUTH LAKE TAHOE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lake Tahoe offers several great skiing options on both its northern and southern shores, but the south, with an abundance of casino-hotels, family-run inns and motels for every budget, tends to be easier on the wallet. Its proximity to Reno also means there are good flight options. There are three ski resorts in the region: the best values can be found at Sierra-at-Tahoe, a smaller resort catering to less-experienced skiers, but serious powder hounds will want to search for bargains at Heavenly and Kirkwood, which regularly get the most snowfall in the region. Just be careful not to give back your savings in the casino.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOW TO GET THERE Reno is just 90 minutes away, and a recent Web search found flights from New York City in late January starting at $263 on <span class="companylink">US Airways</span> and Delta, with one stop. The South Tahoe Express (866-898-2463; www.southtahoeexpress.com[http://www.southtahoeexpress.com]) offers regular shuttle service from Reno-Tahoe International Airport to South Lake Tahoe for $26 each way. Alternatively, it can sometimes be cheaper to fly directly into Sacramento and drive two hours, or to San Francisco, which is three and a half hours away by car.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHERE TO STAY Since winter is off-season in South Lake Tahoe, there are plenty of affordable ski lodges, even at the base of the mountain. Embassy Suites (4130 Lake Tahoe Boulevard; 877-497-8483; www.embassytahoe.com[http://www.embassytahoe.com]) is a good choice for families. Situated at the base of Heavenly, it offers spacious two-room suites with pull-out sofa beds starting at $149 a night, including breakfast and happy-hour cocktails.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stay off-mountain and you'll save even more. Across the road is the 968 Park Hotel (968 Park Avenue; 877-544-0968; www.968parkhotel.com[http://www.968parkhotel.com]), a former Days Inn that was gut-renovated last year into an eco-friendly hotel with stylish rooms, E.P.A.-certified mattresses and a spa. Doubles start at $89 a night in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At rustic Camp Richardson (1900 Jameson Beach; 800-544-1801; www.camprichardson.com[http://www.camprichardson.com]), the year-round lakefront cabins have fireplaces, kitchens and rock-bottom prices in winter (studios start at $95 a night, two-bedroom cabins $110). BONNIE TSUI</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SUNDAY RIVER</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tucked away in the mountains of western Maine, Sunday River often plays second fiddle to resorts like Killington and Stowe. But this behemoth of a ski area -- 132 trails across eight connected peaks -- offers a huge amount of bang for your buck. Sunday River is one of those rare mountains where it's possible to see no one on a run and never have to ski the same trail twice. Ski-and-stay deals abound, both on mountain and in the friendly town of Bethel. Even the lively apres ski scene won't break the bank; $2 beers, anyone?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOW TO GET THERE Sunday River is about 80 miles from the Portland International Jetport and about a seven-hour drive from New York City. Delta, <span class="companylink">JetBlue</span> and United fly direct to Portland from Kennedy Airport; <span class="companylink">USAir</span> from LaGuardia. Round-trip flights start at $189 for the end of January, according to a recent online search. To get to Sunday River from the airport, the cheapest bet is to rent a small car; taxis and shuttles range from $120 to $150 each way. If you can finagle a ride, it's easy to get around the ski resort on the Mountain Explorer, a free shuttle connecting the mountain and charming town of Bethel, about five miles from the mountain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHERE TO STAY Sunday River offers ski-and-stay deals at its 700 condo units and three hotels. Bargain hunters tend to stay at the Brookside, Cascades and Sunrise condominiums (www.sundayriver.com/lodging/condominiums[http://www.sundayriver.com/lodging/condominiums]). These slopeside studios and one-bedroom units have kitchenettes (kitchenware is provided), simple pine furniture and pull-out couches. Each building has a communal vibe, with large common areas, a pool, sauna and hot tub. Condos range from $69 to $119 a person on weekends, and are based on two-night, maximum occupancy. Most condos sleep up to six. Rates start at $50 midweek. Prices include a lift ticket and 90-minute ski clinic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chapman Inn (2 Church Street, Bethel; 207-824-2657; www.chapmaninn.com[http://www.chapmaninn.com]) has rooms for budget travelers of all stripes, from those merely watching their budgets to the severest of penny pinchers. Private rooms with flowered bedspreads and lace curtains range from $99 (queen bed, rocking chair and shared bathroom) to $129 (four-bed suite). And for $35, there's the dorm, a three-level facility with semiprivate bunk beds and a communal kitchen. All guests have access to a game room with a pool table and darts, as well as a full breakfast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are cheaper digs still. The SnowBoardingHouse (646 West Bethel Road, Bethel; 207-824-4224; www.snowboardinghouse.com[http://www.snowboardinghouse.com]) is an 18-bed hostel with pine-paneled walls, a communal kitchen with plenty of counter space, a big living room and a large deck off the back. Guests share bunks, groups can book a more private family room. One night is $25; Hostelling International members stay for $22.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHISTLER</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whistler Blackcomb has never been accused of being a steal. But skiers who want to experience the place in its pre- or post-Olympic glow do have something in their favor this year. Call it Olympic Aversion: visits to a host mountain historically dip during an Olympic year, thanks to a perception that the ski resort will be too crowded, too expensive. To combat this, Whistler has unleashed a blizzard of ski-and-stay packages starting as low as 113 Canadian dollars a night (about $110 at 1.03 Canadian dollars to the U.S. dollar).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOW TO GET THERE The cheapest way to get to Whistler is to fly to Vancouver, B.C., and then take a shuttle 70 miles north. From Newark, nonstop flights to Vancouver in mid-January were under $400 round trip on Air Canada, according to a recent online search. Another tip: Book through Whistler's reservations center (888-403-4727; www.whistlerblackcomb.com[http://www.whistlerblackcomb.com]), which often has fares 15 to 20 percent lower than published prices (plus, most fares are refundable, minus a cancellation fee). From the airport, shuttle transfers are available to Whistler on Pacific Coach Lines (800-661-1725; www.pacificcoach.com[http://www.pacificcoach.com]), from 57 Canadian dollars one way. A car isn't needed at Whistler; free buses circulate throughout the resort.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHERE TO STAY A good place for deals is Whistler's official Web site -- look for ''Last Minute Hotel Deals'' under the ''Accommodations'' tab (or go to www.whistlerblackcomb.com/lastminute[http://www.whistlerblackcomb.com/lastminute]). The hotel name remains hidden from you until you've booked it. This allows hotels with empty rooms to provide rates they wouldn't otherwise offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Best Western Listel Whistler Hotel (4121 Village Green; 800-663-5472; www.listelhotel.com[http://www.listelhotel.com]) is a serviceable if beige hotel with a great location, just five minutes' walk from the lifts, and even closer to the village center. The price isn't bad, either: a midweek room with two queen beds in mid-January is 179 Canadian dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For those willing to go a bit more rustic, the current HI-Whistler Hostel (5678 Alta Lake Road; 604-932-5492; www.hihostels.ca[http://www.hihostels.ca]), on the shores of Alta Lake, is a basic accommodation with a sauna and free Wi-Fi. Part of the Hostelling International network, a dorm-style bed starts at 30 Canadian dollars; private rooms for two, 75 to 100 Canadian dollars, depending on time of winter.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Winter Park</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Winter Park is Denver's backyard hill. In fact, Denver owns the ski area, which might explain why this family-friendly resort remains both unpretentious and affordable. Many Denver residents learned to ski on its wide slopes and mogul-studded steeps. The neighboring towns of Winter Park and Fraser are packed with restaurants and lodges that cater to locals. And with the resort just 90 miles from Denver's airport, getting there is both cheap and easy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOW TO GET THERE Denver International Airport is a hub for United and Frontier, and is served by nearly every domestic airline, so airfare is low. From La Guardia Airport in New York, nonstop flights on United and <span class="companylink">US Airways</span> start at $208 for travel in late January, according to a recent search.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The town of Winter Park isn't pedestrian friendly, but visitors can make do without a rental car, as free shuttles run between the ski area and various points in town. From the airport, Home James (800-359-7503; www.ridehj.com[http://www.ridehj.com]) runs a shuttle from $52, one way. A novel way to get to Winter Park is by train. The Ski Train (877-726-7245; www.riograndeskitrain.com[http://www.riograndeskitrain.com]) departs Denver's Union Station and arrives two hours and 15 minutes later, with round-trip ticket starting at $44. WHERE TO STAY You'll shell out some coin if you want to stay in one of Winter Park's new slopeside condos. But cheaper rooms are yours for the taking in town, two miles from the ski area, and Fraser, 15 minutes away. Options include dated but character-infused ski lodges and motels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Rocky Mountain Inn and Hostel (15 County Road 72, Fraser; 866-467-8351; www.therockymountaininn.com[http://www.therockymountaininn.com]) attracts a mix of guests. Older skiers and families stay at its six B &amp; B-style rooms with private baths (from $79, including breakfast). A younger, more budget-minded crew stays at its four gender-specific dorm rooms (from $22 a person) that sleep from three to six. There are two communal kitchens, stellar views and friendly owners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the town of Winter Park, the Olympia Lodge (78572 U.S. Highway 40; 800-548-1992; www.olympialodge.com[http://www.olympialodge.com]) is a no-frills motel with cozy rooms from $89 and two-room suites from $114. It has an indoor pool and hot tub. Check Winter Park's Web site (www.skiwinterpark.com[http://www.skiwinterpark.com]) for deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you want to be closer to the action, the 118 -room Vintage Hotel (100 Winter Park Drive; 800-472-7017; www.vintagehotel.com[http://www.vintagehotel.com]) is run by the resort and has basic rooms from $98. You won't find lodging closer to the slopes without paying a premium; an open-air cabriolet lift runs behind the hotel. The Vintage has a rental shop and restaurant with 10 types of burgers for under $10 each. CINDY HIRSCHFELD</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WOLF CREEK</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wolf Creek doesn't get much buzz, but Colorado skiers know this family-run gem gets some of the heaviest snowfall in the state. The mountain may sport a modest 1,604 feet of vertical, yet almost every cranny of its 1,600 acres is skiable, with terrain ranging from perfectly pitched groomers to hair-raising steeps. Sure, you won't find megaresort amenities like electronic ticketing or fancy lodges (the base area has just five humble structures). But you won't find megaresort prices, either. Rather, Wolf Creek is a charmingly retro alternative that is supremely affordable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOW TO GET THERE Wolf Creek is in rural southwestern Colorado, and getting there may be the biggest expense. The nearest commercial airport is Durango-La Plata County Airport, about 80 miles west, which services three routes: Frontier and United from Denver and <span class="companylink">US Airways</span> from Phoenix. A recent Web search showed airfares from Kennedy Airport on United starting at about $340 for travel in January. A rental car is required to get around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHERE TO STAY There are no hotels or condos at the base of Wolf Creek. The nearest lodging is in the blink-and-you'll-miss-it town of South Fork, 18 miles east of Wolf Creek. But Pagosa Springs, in the other direction, has more restaurants and other amenities. Rooms for under $100 are easy to find.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Pagosa Springs, the charming Fireside Cabins (1600 East Route 160; 888-264-9204; www.firesidecabins.com[http://www.firesidecabins.com]) has 15 log-style units that offer Old West touches like spurs and saddles, without the kitsch. Each cabin, which sleeps from four to six, is equipped with a kitchenette and gas fireplace and starts at $114.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For more contemporary digs, try the Mountain Landing Guest Quarters (345 Piedra Road; 877-301-4129, extension 5345; www.mountainlanding.net[http://www.mountainlanding.net]). Occupying three low-slung buildings, the hotel has 13 suites, each equipped with kitchenettes and simply furnished with quilts on the beds. A one-bedroom starts at $90.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In South Fork, the 43-room Allington Inn and Suites (182 East Frontage Road; 800-285-6590; www.allingtoninn.com[http://www.allingtoninn.com]) is a newer, chain-style motel with clean but generic rooms, indoor pool and hot tub. Rooms start at $72, but specials for as low as $57 can be found on its Web site. CINDY HIRSCHFELD</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ARTHUR FREEDMAN has lived in a rent-stabilized studio in the East Village for 29 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as he watched housing prices fall over the last year and as a leak in his bathroom went unrepaired month after month, he decided a few months ago that it was time to become a homeowner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Some people might think I'm the luckiest man in the world, paying $725 a month to live in this neighborhood,'' he said. ''But my friends say: 'You can live nicer than this.' And you know what? I should live nicer.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a city where nearly 70 percent of the population rents -- about double the rate for the rest of the country -- the decision to buy an apartment in New York is not taken lightly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now that housing prices have dropped by as much as 30 percent since the height of the real estate boom, even people who, like Mr. Freedman, are paying well under market rates for their rentals, are venturing into the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A rent-stabilized apartment, of course, provides a certain sense of security, with affordable payments and fairly predictable increases. The people who decide to leave this all behind know that they will probably wind up paying more. But they have some very compelling reasons for flying from their protected nests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It could be a desire to upgrade to a nicer building or a larger space. Some trade down in size for the experience of owning. Others take the plunge because they recognize that their rents will soon head into market-rate territory anyway. Major incentives that unite them all, though, are sales prices that have been heftily discounted and mortgage rates that are hovering enticingly low at around 5 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Freedman, 61, lives in a no-frills walk-up in the East Village, and after a five-month search, is now in contract to buy a studio for $305,000. The place is about the same size as his rental, but it is in an elevator building with a doorman on the Upper West Side. Similar apartments in the building sold for as much as $360,000 at the height of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leaving the East Village will not be easy for Mr. Freedman, a retired teacher. ''I'm nostalgic. I have my bagel place and I'm there every morning, 365 days a year,'' he said. ''They were incredulous when I told them. But I'm sure I'll feel comfortable when I move, too.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the years, many of Mr. Freedman's rent-stabilized neighbors have left, and their apartments have been renovated from top to bottom and then deregulated. Market-rate studios in the building now rent for about $1,800, and he suspects that complaints emanating from those premises receive much quicker attention than his do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I know I'm at fault, too, for not asking and pushing for more work to be done,'' he said, gesturing at yellowed walls that probably have not seen a paintbrush in two decades and a stove covered in a thick layer of dust. (He doesn't cook -- at all.) ''But I don't want the hassle to fix it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His broker, Suzanne Zinsel, an agent at Halstead Property, said her colleagues warned her against taking on a rent-stabilized buyer, because these clients are notoriously indecisive and afraid of commitment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Freedman, in fact, did put her through a few extra paces, backing away from two deals before settling on this last one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think he just got scared, and he literally backed out the night before on those deals,'' Ms. Zinsel said. ''But he was very apologetic.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Freedman, who works as a substitute teacher when he can, said that throughout his apartment hunt, he relied on the advice of friends who already own homes, ''because I had no idea what I was doing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three decades of low rent, however, did enable him to save enough for a 30 percent down payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm not Alex Rodriguez here,'' said Mr. Freedman, a consummate Yankee fan. ''I'm not even C. C. Sabathia. It's just me, Artie Freedman.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By his calculations, after tax deductions, his monthly housing costs will be about $1,500, which is double what he pays now, but less than what he would pay for a market-rate rental. ''But it'll be better, because it'll be mine,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Celia Chen, a senior director of the research staff at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com, and a specialist in housing economics, says that the housing cycle nationally is near its nadir, with prices very likely to fall a little more into the middle of next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But even if you're not getting a rock-bottom price,'' Ms. Chen said, ''prices have come down substantially since the peak of the market, and you will get a good, reasonable deal at very low mortgage rates. Now is probably as good a time as ever to buy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because prices will take awhile to start appreciating again, and because closing costs must be factored in, home buyers should plan on staying put for three to four years to at least break even, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Chen also said that while people in rent-stabilized apartments would be hard pressed to find a better bargain, there may also be ''a cost of renting, if you're not renting what you really want to rent.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The residents of rent-stabilized apartments often put up with lesser spaces and fewer services just to hang onto their coveted leases, said Steve Dobkin, a Manhattan lawyer who often represents tenants. ''Tenants in general are nervous to ask for even necessary repairs, because they don't want to be on the landlord's list of undesirable tenants,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some renters ultimately decide that they are willing to pay more for a better quality of life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thomas Coates, another agent with Halstead Property, said that people in rent-stabilized apartments naturally approach buying with great reluctance. ''It's a bit of a golden noose kind of thing,'' he said. ''They may be in a dump, and the landlord is trying to get them to move, but some just don't want to give up the security blanket.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Market-rate renters, on the other hand, have even more incentive, especially since the cost of owning in the current market is often on a par with the cost of renting, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nick and Kevin Burkett-Caudell are clients of Mr. Coates who have lived in a rent-stabilized fifth-floor walk-up in Chelsea for 18 years. They decided to buy because they feel they have outgrown the neighborhood and because they want a proper bathroom. The couple legally combined their last names five years ago, when they were married in Quebec.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their one-bedroom railroad apartment is in a 1900 tenement. Some apartments in the building have bathrooms out in the hall, but the Burkett-Caudells have a water closet in the apartment and a shower stall in the kitchen. ''When I first saw this apartment, I thought it would be great for a year or two, until we found something bigger,'' said Nick Burkett-Caudell, a communications manager at <span class="companylink">Ernst &amp; Young</span>. ''But then, once you're in, you never move because it's stabilized.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In their 20s, they were not bothered by the four flights of stairs and the awkward design of their apartment: You have to walk through the bedroom to get to the living room. But, he said, ''now we're in our 40s and we think we need rooms with doors on them, a proper bathroom, and a place that's more guest friendly.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They also feel that they have moved beyond the club and party scene in Chelsea, and are ready for what he called ''a more established'' neighborhood, which is why they are hoping to buy a one-bedroom in Park Slope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their rent started at about $800 and now is close to $1,400. The average rent for a one-bedroom in Chelsea is $2,916, according to Citi Habitats, but Mr. Burkett-Caudell said that he thought market-rate apartments in his building were now renting for about $1,600. ''We're just a few hundred dollars away from that,'' he said, ''and I don't want to be on the wrong side of that equation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When they crunched some numbers, they determined that buying a one-bedroom in Park Slope for about $400,000 would give them monthly housing costs close to what they are paying now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We wouldn't have been able to do this two years ago, because apartments were too expensive,'' he said. ''But now we're looking at proper one-bedrooms with 600 to 700 square feet in elevator buildings that seem like the Taj Mahal to us.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They made an offer on an apartment last month, but the deal fell through. They now hope to find something early next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clearly, not all rent-regulated tenants can expect to trade up or even get something comparable to what they have now. (The city has some 1 million rent-stabilized units and another 350,000 apartments under other types of regulation.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charlie C. Summers, a vice president of Bellmarc Realty, is working with a client who rents a one-bedroom walk-up in Chelsea for $1,300 and hopes to buy a two-bedroom in the neighborhood for $600,000 to $800,000 -- a tall order even in today's market. In that price range, he and his client have found mostly junior-fours, or one-bedrooms with an extra space that can be converted to a small second bedroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The client hopes to move into a place where her 6-month-old baby can grow up. ''She wants more space, and she wants an apartment that can be a home and an investment,'' Mr. Summer said. But she ultimately may have to move beyond Chelsea to get the apartment she wants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rochelle Meyer knows that she will not be able to replicate what she has now. She has lived at Waterside Plaza on the East River for more than 20 years, in a large one-bedroom that has what she describes as ''a million-dollar view.'' From her 24th-floor windows she can see as far south as the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge and as far west as New Jersey, with the open sky expanding the apartment well beyond its walls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Waterside Plaza was built as affordable housing under the Mitchell-Lama program, and when it left the program about 10 years ago, Ms. Meyer became a ''settlement tenant,'' which allows her to stay as long as she wants with 7.5 percent annual rent increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was fine at first, she said, but the increases have added up and ''now a year goes by very quickly for me. It seems like I just got used to one rent and then, oh, my God, it's time for another one.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her rent started under $1,000 and is now $1,902, but utilities often push her costs well beyond $2,000 a month. It was her financial adviser who urged her to consider buying, and he suggested she look outside Manhattan for something under $400,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But I can't do that,'' said Ms. Meyer, an executive at Citibank. ''I've lived and worked in Manhattan my entire adult life. I can't live anywhere else.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She started her search about two months ago with Carol Halt, a senior vice president of Barak Realty, and is trying to find a one-bedroom for under $500,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''She has an enormous apartment right now,'' Ms. Halt said, ''and when she looks, she thinks, 'How does this compare with my apartment?' But you can't compare, because the difference is she will be building equity in something she owns, instead of throwing her money out the window in rent.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nothing Ms. Meyer has seen so far, with the possible exception of an apartment in Riverdale, measures up to her current home. ''I know it's going to be hard to duplicate what I have in my price range,'' she said. ''So I'm prepared to say that there is something I have to give up. But hopefully the balance sheet will have more positives than negatives.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And maybe, just maybe, she added, ''I could find a diamond in the rough.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARBLETOWN, N.Y. -- SUBDIVISIONS specifically tailored to horse owners have never thrived in the Northeast, but one upstate New York landowner believes he will succeed with his development where others have failed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These horsy-by-design communities cater to the needs of both homeowners and their steeds. Models vary: homeowners either own a large stable collectively or buy a parcel with a small barn. Communally owned amenities often include trails and arenas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Especially common in states like Florida and Texas, equestrian subdivisions have yet to prove themselves in this area, conceded Michael Warren, who is nevertheless creating one, the 19-home Duchess Farm, in Marbletown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The land is so expensive, and developers are not typically equestrian people,'' said Mr. Warren, whose family since 1953 has owned the 100 acres he is subdividing into 19 parcels. He hopes his eventual buyers will be drawn by the state-of-the-art equestrian center that the family already runs on the land -- as well as trails, meadows and ponds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales have been slow since the first few parcels went on the market last year, and Mr. Warren said he thought the market downturn was a factor. ''Had we gone to market earlier,'' he said, ''we probably could have sold it out by now.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, he points out that unlike many developers, his family is in it for the long haul. ''Developers want to develop and move on,'' he said. ''Often, there are equestrian communities advertised, but they haven't built the equestrian part yet -- sometimes, they never do.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, at the 300-acre Greenleaf Farms in Newtown, Conn., cash-starved developers sold out to a large development company, which sold the stable and 43 acres to a private buyer, said Sharon Wimberly, an agent with <span class="companylink">Keller Williams Realty</span> of Ridgefield, Conn., and business manager of Brigadoon Show Stables in North Salem, N.Y.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Developers sometimes do these to get approval by the town,'' she said, ''because it's somewhat appeasing to people who don't want to see the entire area subdivided. Then, developers find out they don't know a thing about the horse world.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Ms. Wimberly, buyers seeking subdivision houses for $600,000 to $900,000 typically don't have the money to keep horses -- and those who do, don't want to live in subdivisions. ''It's a very small market,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Warren, whose family once raised cattle in this Ulster County region popular with second-home owners, initially wanted to sell the land to developers, to enable his 83-year-old father to retire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the town imposed a temporary building moratorium to slow land development, the developers lost interest. Mr. Warren later decided to subdivide it himself, creating a permanent home and livelihood for his family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He feels the family's operation of the equestrian center gives the project an advantage that others have lacked. ''I've visited many equestrian subdivisions,'' Mr. Warren said, ''and I've found the ones that don't work are where the residents are in charge of the equestrian center. Every place I visited, the subdivision was lucky to have 20 percent of residents who actually had horses.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The equestrian center cost more than $1 million to build; the family owns the trails and open spaces under a legal easement that protects them in perpetuity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowner fees are $25 a month, Mr. Warren said, and use of the trails is free. However, if homeowners do want to board a horse, they will pay for that privilege.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan for building the homes at Duchess Farm envisions relatively small parcels, 1.5 to 2.5 acres each, though parcels could ultimately be bought and combined. Mr. Warren was influenced by Randall Arendt, a land-use planner and the author of ''Designing Open Space Subdivisions,'' who walked the property with him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Smaller lots leave as much as 75 percent of the subdivision as open space, Mr. Warren said. ''We tried to provide green space around you, so it feels like it's huge,'' he said. ''But you don't have to mow it, and you're not taxed on it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Warren encourages classic designs with open-space floor plans and porches. His builder has many plans, but buyers can bring in their own. He is doing the subdivision in phases, now marketing about 9 of the 19 lots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property remains home to a working farm; the Warrens harvest organic hay. There is also a ''green'' composting program, minimizing odors and flies from manure by spreading it out to dry. Nearby, the villages of High Falls and Stone Ridge offer a private school, public schools, a dozen restaurants, a live theater, an organic market, a food co-op and other amenities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since Duchess Farm went on the market a year and a half ago, there have been two sales. Recently, one city family bought Mr. Warren's spec home, a 2,100-square-foot ''farmhouse'' on 1.5 acres for $480,000. Someone else bought a 1.5-acre lot for $110,000 as an investment. Mr. Warren said he had had a lot of interest from retirees and second-home seekers, but few actual takers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mary Collins, of Mary Collins Real Estate in Marbletown, has the listing and is marketing lots for $89,000 to about $159,000, depending on the views (all the parcels have protected views of the Catskills and Shawangunks).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a young woman from the city who wants to build a modest house and bring her horse with her,'' she said. ''It will be a weekend home, so she can go to the city and know that her horse will be cared for while she's gone.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Warren says he needs to sell only a few more lots to pay down most of the debt on the equestrian center. Then he can take his time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, with equestrian subdivisions, time may be a good thing, Ms. Wimberly said. ''Down the road in 50 years, when we have no more land,'' she said, ''this subdivision might be very desirable.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE soft, newly cleaned copper of the 1923 storefronts at 717-719 Madison Avenue is a lovely sight, one of the best shop facades on the avenue. But next door, the elegant Verona apartment house of 1908, at 64th Street, bares a raw scar of mutilated terra cotta, almost as a reproach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The strange, intertwined tale of these two structures is one of the mysteries of Madison Avenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1907, Victor Kranich, a piano dealer and inventor, and Richard W. Buckley Jr., an architect, began work on a 10-story apartment house at the southeast corner of 64th and Madison Avenue, which at that point was a brownstone street emerging as an apartment house address.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The luxury apartment age was dawning, and their architect, William E. Mowbray, produced an Italian Renaissance-style facade of such bearing and dignity that few other buildings have surpassed it in elegance. With generous allowance for the exigencies of New York, it is a near thing to the Strozzi Palace, divided into three horizontal sections, with widely spaced large windows with Florentine arches, and a deep overhanging cornice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building was completed in 1908, with two 14-room apartments per floor. In that year, The Real Estate Record and Guide noted that the rentals ranged from $8,000 per year, for the lower floors, to $11,500 per year, for the highest floors. By then, value had begun to rise with height.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The same journal reported that the apartments had private elevators, so that tenants could live ''without the annoyance and discomforts of a public hallway.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And an advertisement in The New York Times in 1910 said that each apartment in the Verona was ''an absolutely detached residence'' for ''families of refinement.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the line on the Madison Avenue side, floor plans show an en suite arrangement of four entertaining rooms -- a dining room, a billiard room, a library and a salon -- and five fireplaces, including two in the four bedrooms. There were two maid's rooms at one end of the back hall, and at the other end, a ''butler's room,'' a designation very rarely seen on apartment plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 1920 census shows an unexceptional medley of brokers, bankers and other businessmen in occupancy. It found three butlers among the 20 apartments: Jasper Chevis, 40, born in South Carolina; Edward Goodman, 31, Irish-born and in the United States since 1910; and Atanski Nunokawa, 29, Japanese-born and here since 1914.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mowbray addressed an issue that had annoyed architectural critics since the advent of the high-rise: the appearance of the side walls. In a 1912 article in Harper's Weekly, the writer, Allan Ball, complained that the side walls on tall buildings were almost always left bare, whereas ''street fronts are treated with lavish expense, apparently in an ostrichlike application of the theory that the other sides are not seen at all.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The classical precedent was for the secondary off-street facades to carry some of the ornament around to show a relation between the side and principal elevations -- just what was done at the Strozzi.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mowbray, too, designed the Verona with a decent respect for the opinion of mankind, giving both of the side walls very healthy ''returns,'' the term for the continuation of the cornice and other decorations around the corner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The architect and owners went to some lengths to achieve this effect. The projections extended over the property line of the adjacent row house on Madison Avenue, and the developers had to receive permission from its owners, John and Harriet Mills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their agreement stated that in return for allowing ''the artistic design'' of the new building, the Millses could request the owners of the Verona to remove the projections at any time, upon 90 days' notice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in 1912, the Millses had an inexplicable change of heart, and with court permission but without explanation, arranged for the chopping off of the cornice, band courses and other elements on the Madison Avenue side wall, leaving a wound that has never healed. They owned the house for the next decade, so they had ample leisure to contemplate the results. But their motives remain a mystery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1923, new owners combined the Millses' row house and its neighbor into a single small apartment house, 717-719 Madison Avenue, and the architect Charles Birge gave it a striking copper storefront, one of the few of its period to survive intact. Early tenants included a British boot maker, a linen shop, an antiques dealer and an interior decorator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, the architect Joseph Tarella of Sawicki Tarella Architecture was commissioned to restore the storefronts, which now gleam with a deep, burnished glow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Tarella, like Mr. Mowbray, sought to add something extra, because the glow now extends to the cornice. It had been hidden by paint or corrosion for decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It appears that he has stripped the copper cornice to its original finish, an unusually elegant touch for such a modest building.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EAST HADDAM -- VILLAGE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE Goodspeed musical theater is to this historic village what mechanized mills were to river towns a century ago. A self-proclaimed manufacturer of musicals, Goodspeed dominates here as both economic engine and property owner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The theater company's main stage, a restored Victorian confection known as the Goodspeed Opera House, draws more than 100,000 people a year to this scenic setting on the banks of the Connecticut River.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond the opera house, Goodspeed holds title to 17 additional properties, including nine Victorian-era residences that provide temporary housing for the actors, directors and technical staff members who put on the productions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Thirty years ago, we wanted to build our own housing,'' said Michael P. Price, who has been Goodspeed's executive director since 1968. ''At that time, the town wasn't ready to let us do that. So we kept buying houses, at $100,000 apiece, which didn't make the town happy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nowadays, the town of East Haddam has revitalization plans for the village, and the Goodspeed, the employer of 75 year-round workers, is the largest owner of housing there. It thus has considerably more leverage with the town -- which for its part has a newfound interest in riding on the theater's coattails. The two recently struck a deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Goodspeed has been cleared to build 17 homes for its artists on land that it owns throughout the village. In return, the theater company will relinquish five of the houses it owns, so that they can be incorporated into village revitalization plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Freeing up buildings in the heart of the village is ''a key starting point'' for a redevelopment effort that envisions more shops, restaurants and residences near the theater, said Mark Walter, the town's first selectman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently, only a handful of shops and restaurants -- including the Goodspeed-owned Gelston House -- operate in the village, along with town offices. ''What's missing is the coffee shop, the bakery, the cabaret,'' Mr. Walter said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Presumably, such businesses could take up residence in the former Goodspeed housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Goodspeed is eager to shed the old houses, which are high on maintenance and low on bathrooms. The new homes will meet one of actors' foremost demands: each of the 65 new bedrooms will have a private bath.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The old houses weren't designed for this kind of living,'' said Dan McMahon, Goodspeed's marketing director, ''so you might have three, four or five actors sharing a bathroom. We've had people pass on a contract just because they didn't want to share like that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Zimmerman, the president of Actors' Equity, the actors' union, confirmed that lack of a private bath can be a deal-breaker, particularly for performers in demanding roles. He recalled that when he played the lead in Goodspeed's production of ''Paper Moon'' about 10 years ago, he started out sharing a bathroom in a company house. His communal spirit quickly faded, however, and he wound up moving to a rented apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They're wonderful old ornate houses, and it's kind of romantic to live that way when you're young,'' Mr. Zimmerman said. ''But when you get to be a certain age ... ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Goodspeed produces at least three musical revivals a year at the opera house, and also develops musicals at its Norma Terris Theater in nearby Chester. (Nineteen Goodspeed productions have gone on to Broadway in its 46 years of operation.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shows can have casts of as many as 40 people, most from New York City, who need housing for as long as 16 weeks, Mr. McMahon said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The centerpiece of Goodspeed's new housing project is a crescent-shaped array of seven homes around a green. A short walk from the opera house, on land currently used for parking, the buildings will be old New England in style, with front porches and clapboard siding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each house will have three to six bedrooms, with shared kitchen and living areas. All will be heated and cooled with geothermal systems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10 remaining houses will be built on three separate sites, including a hillside above Goodspeed's rehearsal studio. Removed from the theater campus, housing there will be reserved for leading actors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The estimated cost of the project is $5.5 million, $2.5 million of it to be financed by a grant from the state Department of Economic and Community Development. Goodspeed will rely on fundraising for the rest, and is already about halfway there, Mr. McMahon said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a sign of the times, Goodspeed has received 55 bids for the project, about five times as many as expected. The company hopes to choose a developer and begin work within a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The five older houses will most likely go on the market in the spring. True progress on the revitalization plan, however, hinges on the relocation of town offices from the village to a vacated middle school. Mr. Walter couldn't predict when that might happen; ''the economy's not cooperating at the moment,'' he noted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regardless, Mr. Price is confident that the theater has turned a corner in relations with the town.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think there's a recognition that we are not the effete elite,'' he said. ''We are a part of the community.''</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Short Sales, a Long Process</span>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHORT sales -- in which mortgage lenders agree to accept less than what is owed, allowing borrowers to escape foreclosure -- were expected to grow easier this year after the Treasury Department proposed industry guidelines to navigate these complex transactions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that has not yet happened, industry experts say, largely because lenders and investors who hold the liens on second mortgages and home equity credit lines often fight for a larger piece of the short sale proceeds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late October, the Treasury Department officially adopted the guidelines, first proposed in April, which include suggestions for how these second-lien holders might be paid in such situations. Lenders and short sale specialists say the new measures could help when they go into effect in April 2010, simply because they offer some structure to a process that has often been chaotic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until then, lenders and foreclosure counselors say, homeowners can continue to expect a painfully slow process that sometimes fails, and can ultimately lead them back to foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's been tough sledding,'' said David Sunlin, <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>'s real estate management executive. ''We've been wanting to improve the short sale process, but our focus this year has been on retention efforts,'' he said, referring to loan modifications and other foreclosure-avoidance initiatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sunlin says that more borrowers are seeking short sales this year than in years past, thereby further straining the bank's ability to handle them in a timely manner. He declined to provide specific numbers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate lawyers and mortgage industry executives say it can take as long as nine months to complete a short sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders say they prefer loan modifications but will accept short sales because they lose less money on such transactions than they do in foreclosures, which often require them to carry the house for months before selling it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Short sales still show up on a borrower's credit history, but lenders are generally willing to offer them a new mortgage two years later, according to Mr. Sunlin. After foreclosures, borrowers typically must wait at least five years before a bank is willing to grant them mortgages, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Treasury guidelines focus on a range of elements in the short sale process. They suggest, for instance, that lenders offer second-lien holders up to $3,000 of the short sale proceeds, with Treasury reimbursing lenders up to $1,000 for doing so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the guidelines, homeowners who are considering a short sale are encouraged to speak with their lenders early in the process about an acceptable sales price for the house, rather than simply contacting a lender when a buyer has made an offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And owners who complete a short sale will receive $1,500 from the federal government for relocation costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Travis Hamel Olsen, the chief operating officer for the Loan Resolution Corporation in Scottsdale, Ariz., which represents servicers and investors in short sale negotiations, said the Treasury Department's incentives would do little to encourage second-lien holders to agree to a short sale. Many delinquent borrowers have second liens, mortgage industry executives say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some states, like Connecticut, New Jersey and New York, second-lien holders can pursue a borrower for the unpaid balance of a loan after a short sale. That point is often a major hurdle for parties in a short sale, especially if the second-lien holder knows the homeowner can liquidate other assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Against this backdrop is the ticking clock of a home sale negotiation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Susannah Gillette, the director of program quality and impact at Neighborhood Housing Services of New York City, a housing counseling agency, said that one property in the Bronx had been through three prospective buyers since April. And in that short sale, she added, there is just one lien holder.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FOR a decade, the need for a down payment was an obstacle for Doris and Terence Zahner. One or the other of them -- usually Ms. Zahner -- was in graduate school, so they were unable to save much, despite their wish to buy a one-bedroom apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I would say, we are throwing money away and not building equity -- the standard argument for why we should own, not rent,'' Mr. Zahner said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for Ms. Zahner, ''there was guilt on my part,'' she said. ''I felt we were not able to afford a place because I was in grad school.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple, both 34, met as sophomores at Cornell University when they lived in the same dormitory. She needed to borrow a hammer to hang some pictures, so she knocked on a door propped open with a red recycling bin. He was inside.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later, Ms. Zahner, who was born in Taiwan and grew up in Edison, N.J., attended graduate school at Columbia University. She now has a Ph.D. in cognitive psychology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initially, she and a roommate shared a one-bedroom in the Whitehall on West 100th Street and Broadway, while Mr. Zahner lived with his parents in his hometown, Glen Cove, on Long Island.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later, he replaced her roommate. The Zahners married in 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their apartment, which felt like a glorified dorm, ended up costing $2,250 a month. They were glad, at least, for a separate kitchen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, ''we had pots and pans that we didn't use because they were too big to fit on the stove and we couldn't wash them in the sink,'' Mr. Zahner said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both love to cook. (Her blog, Food Is Love, is at dzahner.blogspot.com.) ''I am obsessed with food and think about it all the time,'' Ms. Zahner said. ''That's how I know I'm sick, if I don't have an appetite.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once she finished her graduate studies, the couple turned their attention to buying a home. Ms. Zahner now works for a company that creates standardized exams, while Mr. Zahner works at a direct-marketing firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It helped that prices were falling and that the $8,000 first-time home buyer tax credit was available. The Zahners hoped to keep their price in the $400,000s. But in their neighborhood, all they found were small, dark places that were ''unlivable for a couple,'' Mr. Zahner said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bathrooms -- old, ugly, cheap -- made him sad, as did the ''bachelor-who-doesn't-cook-style kitchens.'' In one 96th Street co-op, where the kitchen had one burner, the Zahners were stunned when the agent pulled an additional burner from a cabinet. It was the kind ''you see at a hotel at the omelet station, with a propane canister,'' Mr. Zahner said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And they always peeked in the refrigerator, to see whether the occupant cooked or ate only takeout food.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A good friend of Ms. Zahner's lobbied for them to move to her neighborhood, Inwood. At one point, when Mr. Zahner dropped the friend off at home, they toured the area and hiked in Inwood Hill Park. ''She was trying to sell me on Inwood, and it kind of worked,'' he said. It was lovely and affordable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Zahners were impressed with a two-bedroom two-bathroom co-op at 25 Indian Road for $479,000, down from an earlier price of $549,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inwood has ''some really beautiful Art Deco prewar buildings,'' said Mark D. Friedman, a vice president at Halstead Property, who was referred to them by a friend. But they decided Inwood was just too far.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back on the Upper West Side, their new, more realistic price range -- up to $550,000 -- still wouldn't suffice. Harlem was the logical place to hunt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seeing many pristine condominium units available there cemented their resolve to buy a new place. ''If we were spending this kind of money, watching our budget creep up up up, I wanted it to be nice,'' Mr. Zahner said. A new condo would mean not only a great kitchen, but their own washer and dryer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They bid $482,000 for a sunny 835-square-foot one-bedroom at 50 West, an eight-story condominium building on West 127th Street. It was listed for $499,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But they made the mistake of taking too many people to see it -- parents, siblings, in-laws, friends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Someone pointed out the many abandoned brownstones on adjacent blocks. Someone else suggested they move to Brooklyn instead. Those from the suburbs were concerned about safety.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I got sick of people telling me what I should and shouldn't do,'' Ms. Zahner said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unit sold to someone else, who had offered the same price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Zahners were also interested in the Lore on West 112th Street, which had a shared garden and roof deck, good for outdoor grilling. A one-bedroom, for around $575,000, had just over 600 square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was storage space, too, which they initially thought would make up for the small footprint. But they decided it wouldn't.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So they considered a two-bedroom in the building, around 1,000 square feet, for $699,000. But they were ambivalent about certain design features, including insufficient closet space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So they headed up to the Fitzgerald on West 117th Street, where some one-bedrooms included a home office and a second bathroom. They fell for one on the highest available floor that faced south. It had everything they wanted, including sunlight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This one, with almost 1,100 square feet, was listed at $678,000. The two bought it for $625,000, much more than their initial price target. This time, they didn't show the place to anybody.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The financing was reasonable, however. They needed to leave just 5 percent for a down payment, ''which is unusual in this market,'' Mr. Friedman said. ''It was the building's incentive to get sales going, and it worked.'' Both sets of parents helped with the financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their monthly outlay, including around $750 for the common charge, totals around $4,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though they arrived in August, the place doesn't yet feel like home. ''It feels like we are living in a superfancy hotel,'' Ms. Zahner said. ''I feel like I am going to get a bill underneath my door. A lot of people have their starter home. We sort of skipped that step.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They find homeownership a bit daunting. They worry about the state of the housing market, and about things breaking around the house. They care about keeping the floors and walls in good condition. They still refer to paying the rent, not the mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But their quality of life has never been better. They enjoy cooking even more now, because doing so is much easier. With so much counter space, the kitchen is ''hard to keep messy,'' Ms. Zahner marveled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their Thanksgiving contributions this year came out more delicious than ever, she said. She made, among other things, banoffee (banana and toffee) pie. She dreams of new countertop appliances, things ''I never had before.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">San Juan del Sur, Nicaragua -- Today, like every day, begins with a smoothie: a blend of pineapple, melon, banana, passion fruit, papaya, yogurt, nuts and pitaya, a Central American delicacy responsible for the bright magenta coloring of the drink in Bob Schmidt's hand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One of these will fill you up and keep you going through lunch,'' Mr. Schmidt, 63, said while setting aside a creased paperback and gazing out from his second story to a view of the Pacific Ocean. Surfers flitted along the surface of a neatly groomed groundswell 50 yards below his tiled-floor home, which might pass for a beachfront palace in Malibu but for the wooden plaque on the wall reading ''Bienvenidos a mi hogar'' (''Welcome to my home'') and the sporadic power outages typical of rural developing countries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Schmidt and his wife, Sheri, 62, are among the estimated 3,000 foreign property owners in this country, which, starting in the early part of this decade, followed Costa Rica's lead as an affordable paradise for second- and retirement-home owners. When the Schmidts bought their property here in 2005, paying $200,000 for an oceanfront lot and spending about $80 per square foot in construction costs, the Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega had not yet reclaimed the presidency, and Nicaraguan real estate was booming; asking prices were selling prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much has changed since then. The global economy has tanked. Mr. Ortega has not only regained power, but also won a disputed ruling by the Nicaraguan Supreme Court in November that could enable him potentially to extend his reign; that and a series of unconvincing municipal elections have catapulted Nicaragua, Latin America's poorest country (the per capita gross domestic product was $1,123 in 2008, according to the United States State Department), back into the periphery of international concern.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Schmidt takes another drink of his fruit shake. The tropical flavors, and the atmospheric intangibles of a Sunday morning on the white sands of Hacienda Iguana, one of Nicaragua's fastest-growing southern beach communities, help to make the world's worries seem very far away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Once I saw this place and this beach, that just was it,'' said Mr. Schmidt, who is originally from Southern California but worked as a livestock farmer with his wife outside St. Paul for 36 years. The couple first bought a second home on the beach at Playa Hermosa, Costa Rica, in 2002 for $150,000, calling the impulse buy ''a total fluke,'' and migrated to Nicaragua after his wife's retirement in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''By the time I was ready to retire, it had already gotten so touristic down there that we just wanted to go somewhere else,'' Ms. Schmidt said of Costa Rica. ''And Bob wanted to be on a surf break. So here we are.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some might see an element of financial risk in the Schmidts' purchase of the sort of property that one segment of buyers view as an investment, but Mr. Schmidt said that he and his wife were not driven by the profit motive. ''We came down here really not as an investment per se,'' he said. ''It was more of a lifestyle change.'' Life at Hacienda Iguana, a gated development about 20 miles northwest of San Juan del Sur with 250 home lots and over 70 condos already built, moseys along at a paradisiacal, watch-dissolving pace. Tidal swings and sunsets mark the day's most important events.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think our buyers now are end users,'' said Zach Lunin, a co-founder of Aurora Beachfront Realty in San Juan del Sur. ''The people who are buying with us and investing here are people who want to spend time here. Bottom line is most of the people that we're seeing are not the flippers. Nicaragua is a heart buy for most people, not that it doesn't make sense on paper. But people come here and they fall in love with the country, and that's why they buy property.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Considering that Nicaragua scored an underwhelming 2.5 out of a possible 10 for honesty in the Worldwide Corruption Perception Index of 2009 (the United States was at 7.5, Canada at 8.7 and Mexico at 3.3) as tallied by Transparency International, the romance may include a few speed bumps. (''If you drive to Managua, it is very unlikely that you won't be pulled over,'' Mr. Schmidt said of the incessant traffic shakedowns and bribery attempts performed on gringos by police patrolling the roads.) And while Nicaragua's coming 2011 presidential election is a reminder of the country's political uncertainty, not all foreigners are so easily deterred.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Nicaragua kind of acts like a natural filter,'' Mr. Lunin said. ''It's not everybody who gets on a plane and says, 'Let's go down to Nicaragua,' whereas it is everybody who gets on a plane and goes to Costa Rica.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The impression that Nicaragua is inherently unstable has unquestionably slowed development, but it has also made an investment in ''the New Costa Rica,'' more affordable and appealing to the adventurous segment of aspiring second-home owners. In many cases the numbers support the gamble. In 2008 tourism brought in an estimated $944 million (nearly one-sixth of the G.D.P.), and it has grown by 8.2 percent in the past year, with almost 24 percent of visitors hailing from the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oceanfront lots in gated, rural communities like Hacienda Iguana are selling for around $250,000, and according to some real estate agents, prices have dropped as much as 40 percent in the last two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike in many countries, property laws afford foreigners the same land rights as Nicaraguan citizens, and while the Coastal Law of 2009 prevents the purchase of land within 50 meters of the high tide line and oceanfront lots are eligible for purchase only if registered before a 1917 agrarian reform law, land acquisition in Nicaragua is a relatively straightforward process -- albeit with a few notable concerns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the Sandinista regime confiscated nearly 28,000 properties between 1979 and 1990 in the name of land redistribution, acquiring undisputed titles has become a central issue for foreign investors. ''Most of my clients want title insurance, and I recommend it to them, because it gives them added peace of mind,'' said Byron Mejia, a real estate lawyer in Managua. ''Whatever we miss, the title insurance company picks up, so we don't leave any stone uncovered. Sometimes if there's a problem with the title, you stop right there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aside from potential title disputes, aspiring second-home owners may have to consider the muddled process of constructing their getaways from afar. ''We've watched some of the people who have had to rely on somebody else to supervise,'' Ms. Schmidt said. ''It's a difficult process, and things aren't done the way you might think they would be done. You can't take anything for granted.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ''out of sight ...'' principle applies not only to construction, but also to protecting and maintaining the asset, so hiring security and caretakers is essential. ''It's common sense,'' Mr. Mejia said. ''Let's say you have a home -- oceanfront property you visit three or four times a year. If you leave it unattended, it's like New York City. Someone's going to break in.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While there may be fewer potential buyers than at the height of the real estate boom, those still in the hunt say they are realistic about Nicaragua's political situation. ''I don't think we'll bury ourselves in research on how stable it is,'' said Charles Brooks, an insurance executive from Virginia who is considering the purchase of a lot in a development inland of Hacienda Iguana called Iguana Hills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think we'll take a leapof faith,'' he said. ''It's money that's at risk, perhaps, but not any more risky than watching your 401k. And it's a lot more fun. There's truly an upside to it.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AN empty pizza box was propped against a black fiberglass urn in the hallway outside Three's Company, a gallery that is also the living room of Alex Gartenfeld and Piper Marshall, roommates in a tiny tenement walkup in Chinatown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's what can happen to the art after a show,'' said Mr. Gartenfeld, indicating the urn, which he explained had been part of an installation last spring by AIDS-3D, a Berlin-based duo who were in the ''Younger Than Jesus'' show at the New Museum. That the urn was still there was a source of annoyance to both Mr. Gartenfeld and his roommate, he said. ''We just don't have the room.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was noon on a recent Saturday, and Mr. Gartenfeld, 23, a slight young man who favors owlish glasses and black-and-white clothing, had just awakened, brushed his teeth in the kitchen sink and opened the gallery for business. Et voila: There were pieces by Asher Penn, who prints the words ''KATE MOSS RORSHACH'' over and over on white tape and then makes collages from the tape, set out on a shelf that ringed the narrow living room. A projector on a table was loaded with a film by another artist, Tobias Kaspar, apparently featuring a close-up of hands flipping through a fanzine devoted to Leonardo DiCaprio. But because Mr. Gartenfeld does not know how to work the projector -- that's Ms. Marshall's talent and she was at work -- this reporter had to imagine it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But she got the picture. Fastidious obsession, with both making stuff and celebrity culture, was the theme of the current show, which is open by appointment and up indefinitely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also on view: a sofa, a lamp and a few molded plastic chairs, one with a beer can on its seat. Art?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Not art,'' said Mr. Gartenfeld, whisking the can away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a home gallery, sometimes it's hard to tell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gartenfeld and Ms. Marshall, both of whom have day jobs in the art world (he's the online editor at Interview and Art in America; she's the assistant curator at the Swiss Institute), are part of a new wave of gallerists who for a grab-bag of reasons -- economic, philosophical and purely pragmatic -- are turning their homes into art galleries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some are creating roving galleries, this year's version of the ''Happening'' for the post-grad set, or one-night events in other people's homes, like the Apartment Show or Parlour, which are put together by young artists or curators, and romp from living room to living room and neighborhood to neighborhood like punk bands ''touring'' suburban basements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even at the high end, established dealers like the glamorous Palm Beach, Fla., gallerist Sarah Gavlak are opening their homes: through Dec. 19, Ms. Gavlak's one-bedroom pied-a-terre, in a prim '60s white brick building on 57th Street, is given over to the paintings of Christopher Milne, an artist who creates stylized images inspired by women's magazines of the ''Mad Men'' era.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like 17th-century salonistes, home gallerists use the intimacy of their homes -- or other people's -- to incite discussion and forge a deeper connection to the art.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You can get comfortable in someone's home,'' said Leslie Rosa-Stumpf, an independent curator who is half of Parlour, a nomadic gallery that will appear this Saturday in a town house in Bushwick, Brooklyn. ''It's not a white room with no furniture. People sit on the couch, have a drink, stay for hours and really take it all in.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While noting that apartment shows do not exactly represent a new format, David Rimanelli, a longtime contributor to Artforum who teaches criticism and art history at New York University, described them as ''the ultimate destination galleries.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AT the opening for Mr. Milne's show last month, Ms. Gavlak, 40, wore a scarlet shift with a nipped-in waist and plunging decolletage, neatly matching Mr. Milne's idealized vision of womanhood. In her bedroom, which is open to gallery goers, her bed wore ivory satin, and a Hollywood Regency-style acrylic vanity table, a gift from Beth Rudin DeWoody, the collector, displayed carefully curated personal effects: perfume bottles, a clutch of embroidered handkerchiefs, roses in a vase. Draped above was a knitted banner by the artist Lisa Anne Auerbach that read ''Vive La Revolution d'amour.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm really interested in the history of the boudoir and what went on there,'' Ms. Gavlak said. ''It's fun to watch people when they come into the bedroom. Some are really uncomfortable and just walk out. Others flop down on the bed and hang out for a while. If you look at the apartment as a whole, everything is an aesthetic design in a way, including me, and each thing informs the other things.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Gavlak's apartment began its gallery career by accident. After showing photographs by Ms. Auerbach during Art Basel Miami Beach two years ago, Ms. Gavlak brought the photos to New York, where she spends half the year, and gave a party for Ms. Auerbach in the apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People were like, 'When's the next show?' '' she said. ''Or they said, 'It looks like a gallery in here, do you really live here? Where's all your stuff?' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is stunningly spare. Ms. Gavlak's personal effects are in one of two walk-in closets; artwork is in the other. Like a good saloniste, she eats breakfast on a tray in bed and then slides it underneath the dust ruffle. Her kitchen is as clean and uncluttered as that of a model apartment in a new condominium. (Home gallerists as a whole are not given to the display of random tchotchkes; further, they know how to hide their hair brushes and the Verizon bill.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Relations with artists can be very cozy. When she was courting Mr. Milne, whose work she had seen at a collector's home in Palm Beach, and arranging for a studio visit on the phone one day, she and Mr. Milne realized they lived in the same building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We were both in our apartments when I phoned, and when we figured it out, he said, 'Omigosh, I'm coming downstairs right now,' '' Ms. Gavlak said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the most famously intimate home gallery is Gracie Mansion's bathroom, otherwise known as the ''Loo Division.'' As Ms. Mansion, an impresario of the '80s-era East Village art scene, recalled recently, it was the spring of 1982, and she came up with the idea of doing a show -- or having a party, really -- with the proceeds of her tax refund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Mansion, now a private art adviser and a modern and contemporary specialist for artnet's online auctions, was making art and living in a fifth-floor walkup on East Ninth Street. It was the kind of apartment that had a bathtub in the kitchen and a toilet in a closet, the latter ''an intimate setting,'' she realized, uniquely positioned ''for one-at-a-time viewing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She had been given a few photographs by her friend Tim Greathouse -- who, like so many of her peers, has since died of AIDS -- and had hung them inside the bathroom. ''While contemplating them one day,'' Ms. Mansion said, ''I came up with the idea of giving him a show in there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The arts culture that erupted in Ms. Mansion's neighborhood around that time was at a literal and emotional distance from chilly SoHo and glitzy 57th Street: it was, in the beginning anyway, a community by and for artists, she stressed. ''These were not market-driven events,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, suggested Jed Perl, the art critic for the New Republic and author of ''New Art City,'' a social history of Manhattan's '50s-era art scene, when art is atomized all over town and across the East River, a home gallery is ''maybe just part of a broader mix-it-up mentality: i.e., an industrial loft can be a home, a home can be a gallery, et cetera.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Is there a history to it?'' he continued. ''I'm not sure. My impression of many of the hostess/salon-running/gallerist types -- from Peggy Guggenheim to Holly Solomon -- is that they made a fairly clear distinction between home and gallery. Certainly in the secondary market there has always been a strong tradition of people who deal out of their homes, where 'everything' is for sale: the Tiffany lamp, the Navajo rug, the Guercino drawing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As for the East Village-to-today galleries in the home, maybe in spirit it's related to Happenings and so forth. But isn't the truth that as soon as the cash flow is strong enough, people prefer to move the business to a separate location? So it's also -- let's face it -- a style born of necessity?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">True, yet a low overhead, as some gallerists point out, means you can support and show artists whose work is not market-oriented.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BERNARD LEIBOV was itching for a life change when he was downsized as managing director of a design studio last January. A few years earlier, Mr. Leibov, an investment banker turned brand strategist who is now 46, had attended a Landmark Education workshop -- a self-actualizing program that owes a lot to the '70s-era est movement -- eager to shake a corporate career and start one in the arts. He began curating shows featuring artists from his native South Africa. He also made a pilgrimage to Joshua Tree, the art world's alternative universe in the California desert, which inspired him to make his own work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in New York, ''my relationship with my apartment had grown stale,'' Mr. Leibov said of the Printing House loft he has lived in for 12 years. ''I had fallen out of love with it, it didn't inspire me anymore.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The day he was laid off, he said, he felt a kind of release. ''I was like, O.K., now I know what I'm doing,'' which was to bring a larger audience to the Joshua Tree community he'd become a part of.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, he had his first home show, of the work of the Joshua Tree artist John Luckett, who makes abstract mixed-media pieces. Mr. Leibov's current show, his fourth, is called ''Satellite of Love'' and features armfuls of glowing cast-glass sex toys in rainbow colors tucked into strappy handbags, also made of cast-glass, which makes an exciting backdrop for his morning coffee. The show, up through Dec. 19, is the work of another Joshua Tree resident, Randy Polumbo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Leibov's relationship with his apartment has been similarly rejuvenated. ''I'd been looking for ways to pep it up,'' he said. ''I had felt a lack of energy when I came home. Now, it's fantastic. I get to live like a big-time collector.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ON the Sunday before Thanksgiving, Jill Greenwood, 26, an architectural designer, lent the large railroad apartment in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, she was about to vacate to the Apartment Show organizers, Joshua Smith and Denise Kupferschmidt, who are friends of friends. Ms. Greenwood had already half-decamped, but there was still a lot of her stuff there, including a pile of shoes in a corner, when the show opened that night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Schooled in the viewing of conceptual art, some attendees were puzzled, Ms. Greenwood said. ''People definitely confused my shoes for artwork, and thought I'd messed up the art when I changed out of my flats to heels for the show.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The work of six artists was on view, and there were 150 or so guests at the opening, the 12th Apartment Show organized by Mr. Kupferschmidt and Mr. Smith, both of whom are artists and were inspired, they said, to show the work of their peers to their peers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When they began last year, Mr. Smith said: ''I felt like everyone was throwing around the word 'context' all the time, meaning they all wanted their work to be shown 'in the proper context,' typically code for a well-branded institutional space. This is a way to get people to loosen up a little and just hang out and relax.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since their first show last January, at another friend's apartment in Greenpoint, they have never wanted for a space, for artists to show or for guests, whom they found by drawing from the mailing lists of the galleries where they worked and by tapping the <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> ''friends'' of Jerry Saltz, the art critic at New York magazine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He has like 3,000 friends,'' Mr. Smith said. (Actually, as of this week he had 4,230.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As most of the apartments donated are rentals, given at the end of a lease, Ms. Kupferschmidt said: ''Often, we're the last people in them. We clean up after the party, but it's like we're cleaning up after them, too. It's like the apartment was ours and we're leaving it forever.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NINE years ago, Brookie Maxwell, an artist, was running a nonprofit arts group for at-risk inner-city children, but wanted a job that would allow her to be a work-at-home mother to her son, Ellis, who was then 4. She bought a loft on West 17th Street, put her living quarters in the back, and created a wide-open central space ringed with canvas on three sides. Ms. Maxwell, who is 53 and the daughter of the legendary New Yorker editor William Maxwell, has been showing art in all media there ever since.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other day, a video by Zefrey Throwell was playing on one canvas wall -- an extremely upsetting film depicting the artist's girlfriend as she tries (and succeeds) to make herself faint by hyperventilating. Happily, the inevitable doesn't take too long; afterward, as this reporter recovered, Ms. Maxwell pulled back the canvas to show Ellis's basketball hoop. ''It's good when I have a video show,'' she said, ''because then he and his friends can play basketball.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, Ellis and his friends have accrued many perks from Gallery 138, as it's known. Five years ago, for a show commemorating Brown v. Board of Education, the artist Satch Hoyt was working on a life-size cast-sugar bust of Justice Thurgood Marshall. Trying to get it just right, he made several tests during the course of a week, all of which were stored in the fridge (the kitchen is hidden behind another curtain).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Ellis's friends would come over and ask, 'Can I lick Thurgood Marshall's face again?' '' Ms. Maxwell said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most gallery goers don't realize that Gallery 138 is also a home until they use the bathroom, at which point human nature asserts itself and they start to snoop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I can always hear them pull the shower curtain back,'' Ms. Maxwell said. ''So I put something in there for them to see.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not bath toys. Nosy art hounds will discover the pelvis bone of some animal topped with a toy alligator. No one has ever commented, she said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CHULA VISTA, Calif. -- Eduardo Tostado was a prosperous man whose businesses and pleasures straddled the coastal border. He owned a big house and a used-car lot in the San Diego suburbs, and a seafood restaurant in Tijuana.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was also part of the border underworld, the authorities say -- a high-ranking member of the Mexican drug cartel driving much of the United States' illegal marijuana trade and the cascade of violence in a 40-year drug war. Some evenings, Mr. Tostado drank tequila at the Baby Rock club in Tijuana or sipped Scotch at the Airport Lounge in San Diego. He socialized mainly with men he knew well and women he knew not at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His wife, Ivette Rubio, was aware of this, and they were having problems in their marriage. So when Mr. Tostado called her in June 2007 to say he had been kidnapped and needed her to sell their house to pay a ransom, she did not believe him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You got drunk,'' she said, ''and you went out, and you didn't come to sleep in the house.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Click, the phone went dead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tostado was in the hands of Jorge Rojas-Lopez, a former member of the cartel, the Arellano Felix organization, who had turned on it. Based in the San Diego suburbs, Mr. Rojas-Lopez was running a renegade squad of kidnappers and hit men, fighting for a piece of the marijuana market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the border, the Mexican government, with $1.5 billion from the United States, is battling its drug cartels, and the cartels are battling one other. The Arellano organization has borne the brunt of these drug wars, and has fragmented into smaller crews spinning across the border like shrapnel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We believe there has been a splintering of the A.F.O. and that it has lost the power that they once wielded,'' said Keith Slotter, the agent in charge of the F.B.I.'s office in San Diego.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The illegal drug market has never been so unsettled, drug enforcement experts say, with small elite killing squads like the one Mr. Rojas-Lopez was running -- Mr. Slotter identified three in San Diego alone -- operating on both sides of the border. For three years, Mr. Rojas-Lopez's rogue squad, a mix of United States citizens and Mexicans, used houses in tract developments as roving bases, hunting cartel members and imprisoning their prey along bland residential streets. They secured ransoms worth millions. Payment, however, did not guarantee that the victims survived.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At stake were billions of dollars in profits from tons of smuggled marijuana, and other drugs, and the precious control of Mexican border cities like Ciudad Juarez; Nogales; and Tijuana. Those cities are thoroughfares to the world's most lucrative drug market: the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The authorities in Kansas City, Mo., and Miami are also investigating the Mr. Rojas-Lopez's squad for drug trafficking and killings in their cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rojas-Lopez and eight other members of the squad, called Los Palillos, are now on trial in San Diego, charged with kidnapping 13 men and killing 9 from 2004 to 2007. Seven other co-defendants are fugitives. Since the investigation began, three more fugitive squad members have been killed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This account of Los Palillos in Tijuana and San Diego, based on more than 6,000 pages of court documents, testimony from 175 witnesses and co-defendants, and interviews with law enforcement officials, offers a window into how Mexico's drug wars are playing out on American soil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rojas-Lopez's ambitions were fueled by more than just desire for a piece of the marijuana trade. He also wanted revenge for the death of his brother, Victor, a cartel enforcer, who was killed by the Arellanos organization in 2003 for insubordination. Mr. Rojas-Lopez's squad eluded the Arellanos cartel and law enforcement officials in San Diego for three years. Investigators heard whispers of a mutinous enforcement squad operating in the area but were unable to put the pieces together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Relatives of the kidnapping victims either avoided the police or withheld crucial information about their loved ones. Instead, they quietly sold assets on both sides of the border, raising hundreds of thousands of dollars in a matter of days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some victims were released unharmed. Others were smothered with masking tape, shot in the stomach or pulverized with a police battering ram and dumped on a suburban street. Or they were boiled down in acid and never seen again, a technique known in Mexico as ''pozole,'' or Mexican stew.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tostado, the kidnapped businessman with the big house here, and his wife were among the pawns in this underworld, with Mr. Rojas-Lopez demanding $2 million from Ms. Rubio for her husband's life. The next call she received that day was not from her husband.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She did not recognize the voice that said, ''Hey, you want me to send your husband in pieces or what?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Call to Police Pays Off</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time of his abduction, Mr. Tostado, a legal resident of both the United States and Mexico, was helping the Arellanos cartel ''pass tons of marijuana'' across the United States border, according to the federal agents and Jose Olivera-Beritan, one of the nine suspected members of Los Palillos who is on trial in San Diego Superior Court for murder and kidnapping. ''He knew in advance which trucks will be searched,'' Mr. Olivera-Beritan said of Mr. Tostado in a jailhouse interview. ''He told us he was giving cops money under the table.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tostado has offered contradictory statements to agents regarding his cartel affiliation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His wife, Ms. Rubio, took a risk that night in June 2007 by calling the police. Investigators say that it made the difference between Mr. Tostado's survival and the stories of less-fortunate kidnapping victims.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The event that led to the renegade squad occurred in 2003, when Victor Rojas-Lopez crossed the cartel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One evening at Zool, a nightclub in Tijuana, members of his enforcement squad got in a fight with members of another Arellano squad over a woman. A member of Victor Rojas-Lopez's team pushed a gun into the face of a man who happened to be the brother-in-law of the cartel leader, according to grand jury testimony.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bosses ordered Victor Rojas-Lopez to kill the underling. He refused and was shot to death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His younger brother, Jorge, then took over the squad, called it Los Palillos -- ''the toothpicks,'' after Victor, who was skinny but tough -- and fled to San Diego.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Amador, a San Diego County deputy district attorney who is the lead prosecutor against Los Palillos, said that much of the evidence about what happened next came from an insider, Guillermo Moreno, an American citizen and the member of Los Palillos who had pulled the gun at Zool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He is the witness that pulls all the pieces together,'' Mr. Amador said. Mr. Moreno, who was arrested after Mr. Tostado's kidnapping, ultimately led investigators to rental houses around San Diego used by Los Palillos. In a deal with prosecutors, he agreed to a minimum 25-year prison sentence, rather than life. At some houses, forensic investigators found DNA from victims.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When members of Los Palillos first arrived in San Diego, they lived quietly off earlier spoils. Then they went back to the work they knew best: killing and drug trafficking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first corpses were found on Aug. 15, 2004, decomposing in a Dodge minivan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The police said the bodies belonged to three drug smugglers who had crossed the border to do a deal with the squad members.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The squad used safe houses with attached garages so they could move drugs or bodies in and out without being seen, Mr. Moreno, the witness, said. In many neighborhoods, the real estate bubble created a constant churn of new faces, so it was easy to go undetected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three smugglers expected to drop off several hundred thousand dollars' worth of marijuana, sleep over and leave for Mexico in the morning. Instead, Mr. Moreno said, the squad waited for the men to fall asleep, then shot one of them in the stomach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Someone said, 'Quit crying, you,' '' Mr. Moreno told the grand jury. The man bled to death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other two smugglers were suffocated. Mr. Rojas-Lopez is accused of stealing their marijuana and ordering Mr. Moreno to dump the bodies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Arellanos cartel, meanwhile, ordered a former Baja California police officer named Ricardo Escobar Luna, 31, who was working for the cartel, to hunt down Los Palillos in San Diego.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But members of the squad learned that Mr. Escobar was after them and abducted him from his home in Bonita, Calif., according to testimony from Mr. Moreno. The kidnappers disguised themselves as police officers and drove up in a <span class="companylink">BMW</span> with flashing lights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Escobar's wife called the police but never mentioned that her husband worked for the Arellanos cartel, said Steve Duncan, an investigator for the California Department of Justice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Testifying before the grand jury, Mr. Moreno described how he had overheard a discussion among squad members before the kidnapping: ''Well, he's here to kill us; we might as well kill him.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Aug. 20, 2005, Mr. Rojas-Lopez took a police battering ram into the bedroom where Mr. Escobar, the former police officer, was tied up, according to testimony by Mr. Moreno.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Mr. Moreno went outside to water the lawn and keep an eye on the neighbors, he said. When he went back inside, he saw blood on the walls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Victor Escobar, the former officer's brother, told investigators that he had paid the squad $600,000 for his freedom, but he never had much hope. ''Yeah, I knew they'd kill my brother,'' he said. ''But what else could I do?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By September 2005, the police were beginning to understand that the killings around San Diego were related, but they still did not know how. The case began to unfold when two squad members with automatic rifles and pistols bungled the kidnapping of an Arellanos cartel trafficker in a cul-de-sac in Chula Vista, in broad daylight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A police cruiser chased the gunmen to a strip mall parking lot and was barraged by bullets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gunmen were caught later that day and eventually convicted for attempted kidnapping and the attempted murder of a police officer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within a few years, Los Palillos had become a minicartel with a drug trafficking network that snaked through the Mexican cities of Ensenada and Tijuana, San Diego and on to Missouri and Florida, according to federal agents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two Cuban nationals ran Los Palillos operations in Kansas City, Mo., Mr. Moreno, the witness, told federal officials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September 2006, a woman in the small farming community of Jameson, about 50 miles north of Kansas City, heard gun shots and then found two bodies near a barn. Deputies discovered a 47,000-square-foot marijuana garden behind rows of corn stalks. Members of Los Palillos were arrested on suspicion of killing local rivals, the authorities said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By 2007, the authorities said, the renegade squad had made millions of dollars. Mr. Rojas-Lopez wore Rolex watches. Photographs on MySpace showed his squad members hoisting drinks at trendy San Diego bars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May 2007, two more drug smugglers, both 33, were kidnapped, and they were never seen again. Mr. Moreno told federal agents that their bodies had been dissolved in a vat of acid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beer, Soccer and Arrests</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before he was kidnapped, Mr. Tostado was worried. A man had left an extortion note at the front door of his home, recorded by his security camera. Armed with a picture of the man, Mr. Tostado drove down to Tijuana to find some answers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tostado, an avid off-road racer, who admitted in court that he had socialized with members of the Mexican underworld and had accepted a $200,000 race car from the Arellano family, learned that the man in the photo was a member of Los Palillos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few weeks later, an acquaintance introduced Mr. Tostado to a Tijuana woman named Nancy. On June 8, Nancy invited Mr. Tostado to her home in Chula Vista. Mr. Tostado walked in carrying bottles of Cognac and whiskey. Hands grabbed him from behind in the darkened room. Someone fired a Taser, immobilizing him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tostado was held for eight days while Los Palillos negotiated by phone with his wife. He said that he drank beers with his abductors, who watched soccer on television and smoked marijuana.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Occasionally, Mr. Rojas-Lopez would vent angrily about the Arellanos cartel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They have killed my family and my brother,'' he told him. ''I had to do something, and I have the nerve to do it over here.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By June 16, Mr. Rojas-Lopez had agreed to accept $193,000 in cash. Wiretapped calls recorded the kidnappers directing the dropping off of the ransom money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On June 16, 2007, federal agents arrested the squad leaders, Mr. Rojas-Lopez and Juan Estrada-Gonzalez, the second-in-charge, after they dropped the money off at a motel. Another team of agents stormed the house where Mr. Tostado was being held and freed him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later that day, as Mr. Tostado recounted his experience to federal agents, he pledged to leave the underworld behind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think I need to start over again,'' he said. ''I'm reborn right now.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tostado is keeping a low profile these days. He sold his house in Chula Vista and no longer races the off-road circuits in Mexico.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He sold his restaurant in Tijuana, too, after someone left three barrels in front of it in 2008. They were full of bones and acid.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HAMILTON, N.J. -- THE trash talk on the boccie court at the Hamilton Township Senior Center was heating up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What's the matter, you can't bend down?'' Natale Gigliotti, 71, shouted to an opposing player who lunged as he tossed the ball. ''Corto, corto'' -- short, short -- Mr. Gigliotti said as the ball landed. ''That's a boo-boo.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Ohhhh, they love to talk,'' said Ray Fink, 79, Mr. Gigliotti's boccie partner and a regular at the center's billiard tables and boccie court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hamilton, in Mercer County, is a pleasant suburban town, not far from Trenton, with a smattering of historic homes, the requisite big-box stores and a pre-Revolutionary pedigree. It also has more residents who are 65 and older than many other towns in New Jersey -- 15 percent of its nearly 94,000 people, while in some towns the proportion is 5 percent or less -- and that demographic fact has forced Hamilton to pay close attention to the needs of its elderly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not to say that other towns and counties are far behind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In just two years, baby boomers will start to retire, and by 2030 the number of America's elderly is expected to reach 72 million, more than double the number in 2000. Demographers expect the suburbs to age particularly quickly, as residents retire close to home, or as those who have already moved to the Sun Belt return to live near relatives as they grow frail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some towns are already feeling these effects: Twenty percent of Glen Cove, in Nassau County, is 65 and older, for instance, as is 23 percent of Somers, in Westchester County.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This increase in the number of elderly will place unparalleled strains on many suburbs' services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the Northeast, we have to look at it as if the clock is ticking,'' said Brian M. Hughes, the Mercer County executive. ''We have an aging housing stock and a population that is not increasing as much as the rest of the country. We need to figure out how we're going to provide more services with a smaller tax base.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mercer County, with its grayer population, offers a peek at the future in terms of preparing for its aging residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the housing front, the county has seen a sharp rise in developments for people 55 and over. These adult communities, some with house prices reaching $500,000, pay homage to the retirement villages of Florida, only on a smaller scale. They offer gardens, large clubhouses and swimming pools, games and a built-in social life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An estimated 13 such adult communities have been built in Mercer County since 2002 -- a much brisker pace than in previous years. Almost all their homes, usually one story and requiring little yardwork, are tailor-made for the aging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The county has also seen a boom in assisted-living facilities, said Sherrill Senter, a real estate agent with the Keller Williams Hamilton firm, who added that builders are planning for older people even in the general housing market. Many newer houses, she says, have a bedroom on the first floor or a study that can easily be converted into a bedroom for an aging parent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate agents, eager to learn of plans that will affect them, now attend meetings between nonprofit groups and the Mercer County Office on Aging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The county has also supplemented its network of shuttle vans for the elderly by arranging to use other vans, borrowed from the Association of Retarded Citizens and other groups, when available. And the Hamilton senior center is offering its own transportation service -- something such centers do not often do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As the population ages, we have to find a way to get them mobile,'' said Kathleen Fitzgerald, a nurse and the supervisor of senior services at the center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, also with its eye on a grayer future, Mercer Community College started to offer a certificate in gerontology for health care providers, social workers, caregivers and others. The required courses include such subjects as the aging process, memory loss and a holistic approach to aging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eileen Doremus, executive director of the county's Office on Aging, said that a gerontology certificate would become essential to doing business. ''It doesn't matter what realm you work in and live in,'' she said. ''You will be interacting with people who are older, be it in real estate, health care, retail.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local governments like Mercer County are not alone in their efforts. Over the past two years, the state of New Jersey has instructed 400 chronic disease health managers in training the elderly to avoid costly trips to hospitals. Trainers teach the elderly how to keep tabs on their ailments and cope with pain and frustration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senior centers are another important aspect of elderly care, and so it is in Mercer County. As he took a break from one of his regular billiards games, Mr. Fink -- Mr. Gigliotti's boccie partner -- explained how he ended up at the Hamilton senior center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I didn't want to move into the city; I have always lived in the suburbs,'' said Mr. Fink, a former quality control manager for an electronics manufacturer. He also wanted to be near his son, who lived in Hamilton. Then, he said, ''I met a couple who told me about Mercer County and said they had the best senior center. I'm very active.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The senior center moved to a spacious building in 2001. To be successful, such facilities must shake off their stigma as depressing places where the elderly come just to eat a hot meal and shuffle about. In Hamilton, that stigma remains, but less so every year, Ms. Fitzgerald said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The center, which is publicly financed and has a hard-to-get national certification by the National Council on Aging, provides the requisite lunch, health checks and help with paperwork. But visitors can also sit down at computer banks to learn how to design Web pages or post photos online; they do the cha-cha with a dance instructor; sing in choral groups and on karaoke night; swim in the small pool; smack down dominoes and stage plays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are even a few younger patrons, whose needs differ from those of older ones. One example is Paula and Jack Beiger, who practiced the rumba one morning, keeping impeccable time to the music.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Some people our age are almost embarrassed to come to the senior center,'' said Ms. Beiger, 54, who is allowed in only with her 63-year-old husband (members must live in Hamilton and be at least 60). ''We come just for the dancing and have such a good time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for Mr. Fink, he does not plan to leave Hamilton Township. But he does worry about the aging of the baby boomers. He waited a year and a half for his current apartment -- in a subsidized building for the elderly called Pond Run -- and that was before the rising tide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As a nation, we have to set up more volunteer programs to support these people,'' Mr. Fink said. ''There will be so many of them.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE downtown market has the largest inventory of unsold luxury properties in Manhattan, but brokers say deals are being done on some of the most talked-about places in some of the most sought-after neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Palazzo Chupi, five condominiums that the artist and filmmaker Julian Schnabel built atop a former stable at 360 West 11th Street, has been the scene of considerable activity lately. Mr. Schnabel, who also has a studio in the building, has suffered through a year of embarrassing accounts of unsuccessful price cuts in the real estate blogs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in October, the triplex penthouse with Venetian-style arches, once listed for $32.5 million, was sold for $10.5 million to William J. B. Brady, a banker at <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span>. Mr. Brady had spent $15.5 million in the fall of 2008 for a slightly smaller apartment in Palazzo Chupi.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The final condo being sold by Mr. Schnabel, a 3,960-square-foot duplex with three bedrooms and three balconies, is said to be in contract negotiations. The asking price was $12.95 million; Peter McCuen &amp; Associates has the listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And now brokers say an apartment in the Chupi bought by the actor Richard Gere for $12 million has just been resold, for about $1 million less than he paid for it. Richard Orenstein, of Halstead Property's SoHo office, who handled the sale, declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gere bought the apartment in fall 2007 as the luxury market was approaching a peak. Brokers say that it appears that Mr. Gere actually got a bargain, perhaps in exchange for adding celebrity pizazz to the palazzo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment has nearly 3,500 square feet of space, including four bedrooms, along with a small balcony and two larger terraces connected to the apartment by French doors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Gere, who between films has immersed himself in country life -- with a house, a bed-and-breakfast, and now a dispute over some trees he chopped down on his property in Westchester -- showed little interest in his Chupi pied-a-terre.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He put the apartment on the market in April 2008 for $17.995 million, and the following October, in the midst of the financial crisis, cut the price to $15 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Gere sale was completed just as the appraiser Jonathan Miller reported that the largest backlog of unsold apartments in Manhattan is of the expensive downtown variety. Mr. Miller defines downtown as south of 34th Street from the Hudson River to Fifth Avenue, and south of 42nd Street from Fifth Avenue to the East River. He found that at the current sales rate, it would take 27 months to sell the existing inventory of condos listed at $5 million and up, and more than three years to sell the current stock of downtown co-ops in the same price range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But brokers point to recent movement downtown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another former stable, at 11 Spring Street, just off the Bowery, sold for $19.5 million, a significant sale -- though far less than the $39.8 million once asked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was not clear whether the developers, who paid $12 million for the graffiti-splattered wreck in 2006, and spent millions to convert it to luxury housing, made a profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers also report a deal taking shape on an unusual 8,000-square-foot duplex penthouse loft space at 140 Perry Street that was once listed for $19.9 million. They say the apartment, though not officially on the market, has been shown by Jan Hashey, a broker at Prudential Douglas Elliman. She did not return several phone calls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in the West Village, a town house at 26 Bank Street owned by James D. Huniford, the interior designer, sold for $7.25 million, nearly $1 million below the asking price, property records say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leonard Steinberg, a broker at Prudential Douglas Elliman, said that brokers showing larger apartments in hot neighborhoods like the Village were busy, with a shortage of properties and a ''surplus of buyers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I tell people if you have a good apartment in the Village, you don't have to worry about a darn thing,'' he said. ''And the West Village is about as recession proof as any neighborhood I have ever seen.''</p>
