<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Durable Goods Orders Slid 2% in November</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders to factories for big-ticket manufactured goods fell by the largest amount in six months, led by a large decrease in orders for defense aircraft and parts. A closely watched category that tracks business investment ticked up 0.1 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders for durable goods fell 2 percent last month, the biggest decline since May, the Commerce Department said Monday. Orders have fallen in two of the last three months. October's number was revised down to 0.2 percent from a 0.6 percent gain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Transportation equipment orders fell 5.9 percent, its biggest decline since May. Excluding transportation, new orders were flat. Orders for motor vehicles and parts rebounded after the G.M. strike, up 1.9 percent, but it wasn't enough to offset the large decrease in defense aircraft orders. Orders for defense aircraft and parts fell 72.7 percent and are down 14 percent in the last year. A.P.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of New Homes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rose 1.3% in November</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of newly built homes increased 1.3 percent in November from the previous month, a sign that low mortgage rates are pushing up purchases as well as prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said Monday that new single-family houses sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 719,000 last month. Sales surged in the Northeast and West, but were flat in the Midwest and fell in the South.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales have increased 9.8 percent so far this year. The increase largely reflects a steady decline in mortgage rates, which has made borrowing cheaper and brought more people seeking to upgrade their house into the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, prices have moved upward as a result of construction lagging demand. The median new-home sales price was $330,800, up 7.3 percent from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand has been stoked by a steady decline in mortgage rates over the last 12 months. The typical 30-year mortgage rate has fallen from roughly 4.9 percent a year ago to 3.8 percent this November. A.P.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Lola Fadulu </div><div>914 words</div><div>21 December 2019</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>19</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2019 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soaring rates of homelessness in California, which is struggling with out-of-reach housing costs and affordable housing construction, pulled that figure upward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Homelessness in the United States continued to rise this year, driven by soaring rates of homelessness in California, according to a new federal report that could prompt long-promised action for people living in the streets of Los Angeles and San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homelessness rose 2.7 percent from 2018 to 2019, according to the annual assessment by the <span class="companylink">Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>. That figure was pulled upward by a 16.4 percent increase in homelessness in California, which is struggling with out-of-reach housing costs and intractable fights over affordable housing construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A summary of the report was first published by The Associated Press.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ben Carson, the secretary of housing and urban development, blamed welfare programs that he said fostered dependency and despair. On President Trump's favorite cable program, ''Fox &amp; Friends,'' on Friday, Mr. Carson said policies that allowed people to sleep on streets, bridges and other public places were not compassionate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such policies are creating a ''health hazard,'' he said, discouraging homeless people from going ''to the places that are actually designed to help them get out of that situation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We still have to provide a mechanism for people to ascend out of a level of dependency and despair and reach the right place,'' Mr. Carson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senior Trump administration officials visited California in September to troubleshoot ways to minimize homelessness. Over the summer, Mr. Trump said on Fox News that his administration was ''looking very seriously'' at abating the homelessness crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The administration has yet to release its promised homelessness plan for California, but activists fear Mr. Trump's pending executive order could crack down on homeless encampments, give more resources to police departments to clear shanty towns and threaten cities that fail to control their homeless populations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A <span class="companylink">White House Council of Economic Advisers</span> report in September emphasized criminal justice responses to ending homelessness. And an aggressive response would be in keeping with other Trump administration actions against California, which has already been threatened with a loss of federal highway funding over a backlog of pollution-control plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We know that there is a lot of homelessness in California, but we also know there's a lot of homelessness nationally, and what's driving that is increased housing costs,'' said Maria Foscarinis, the founder and executive director of the <span class="companylink">National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Housing costs are going up dramatically in many parts of the country, including in California, and that's driving increases in homelessness as well as a housing crunch for many people,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">HUD</span> report said 568,000 people experienced homelessness on a single night in January 2019, according to The A.P., up from last year's count of 553,000. But the number of homeless veterans and homeless families with children declined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to The A.P., the states with the lowest rates of homelessness per 10,000 people were Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, Virginia and North Dakota. The states with the highest rates were New York, Hawaii, California, Oregon and Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington announced Thursday that he would spend $300 million to end homelessness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The figures are based on people in shelters and people who are visible and counted in public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If anything, Ms. Foscarinis said, those numbers are ''a severe undercount.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The summary of the report comes after the Trump administration has taken a number of steps that have worried advocates for homeless people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, the White House appointed Robert Marbut, a former homelessness consultant, to direct the <span class="companylink">United States Interagency Council on Homelessness</span>, which works with 19 federal departments and agencies to address the matter. Mr. Marbut has worked with cities in states such as California and Florida to build homeless shelters equipped with job training, mental health services, and other support services. His shelters often have an outside courtyard where people who have broken rules are told to sleep.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Marbut told HuffPost in 2014 that he believed in ''Housing Fourth,'' which breaks from the widely accepted ''housing first'' philosophy that holds that people need to be given stable shelter before they can be expected take advantage of other support services such as job training or mental health counseling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Marbut is succeeding Matthew Doherty, who was pushed out in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April, the housing department proposed a rule that would bar families with undocumented immigrants from receiving housing assistance. The public comment period closed in July and over 30,000 public comments were submitted. The department must consider those comments before completing the rule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May, the department proposed requiring homeless shelters to make transgender clients use bathrooms and sleeping accommodations that match their biological sex, a rule that some feared would open transgender homeless people to abuse in shelters and keep them on the streets. The public comment period has not opened yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August, the department proposed raising the legal bar to prove that a landlord, insurance company or lender is guilty of housing discrimination, setting a standard that civil rights advocates say would make proving discrimination virtually impossible.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Airbus Subsidies Case</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A <span class="companylink">World Trade Organization</span> panel ruled Monday that the <span class="companylink">European Union</span> has not complied with an order to end illegal subsidies for the plane maker <span class="companylink">Airbus</span>, which prompted the Trump administration to impose tariffs on nearly $7.5 billion worth of <span class="companylink">European Union</span> goods in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its ruling, a W.T.O. compliance panel found that the E.U. had not taken sufficient steps to end harm to <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>, the major rival to Europe's <span class="companylink">Airbus</span>. The E.U. is expected to appeal, though the United States is on the cusp of preventing the W.T.O.'s appeals court -- the Appellate Body -- from ruling on any new appeals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The E.U.'s Commission criticized the panel for making a ''number of serious legal errors in its assessment of E.U. compliance,'' and said its recommended ways of compliance would be ''very problematic for a larger part of the W.T.O. membership.''

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Falls 0.8% in October</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spending on construction projects fell 0.8 percent in October, dragged down by declines in apartment and multifamily home-building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private construction spending declined 1 percent in October, the Commerce Department said on Monday. That followed another significant 1.1 percent decline in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall private residential construction dipped 0.9 percent, with multifamily projects declining 1.6 percent in October after a 2.1 percent decline in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spending on single-family home construction increased 1.6 percent, helping to offset some of the losses elsewhere in the private construction category during the month. Last month, the government reported that home building jumped 3.8 percent in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower mortgage rates and a healthy job market with rising wages have boosted home sales and the demand for new homes. The average rate on a fixed 30-year mortgage last week was 3.68 percent, a historically low number. A.P.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home Sales Rise 1.9%, Lifted by Lower Rates</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans took advantage of lower mortgage rates and bought more homes in October, though sales were held back by a shortage of available properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said Thursday that sales of existing homes rose 1.9 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.46 million. That's 4.6 percent higher than a year ago, suggesting that lower borrowing costs are bolstering the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the data shows a mixed picture.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, sales have been constrained by a decline in the number of houses for sale.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comparing home prices in New York City? Look hard at the common charges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sure, it's a buyer's market in New York City, but proceed with caution. Any price comparisons need to take monthly common charges, or ''monthlies,'' into consideration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monthlies -- which typically include maintenance fees, taxes and any assessments imposed for building improvements -- vary depending on the circumstances of a given building and unit. Localize.city, the real estate search and data site, recently analyzed how the charges in one-bedroom apartments compared among New York neighborhoods, and shared their findings with us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The researchers looked at the more than 32,000 New York City listings on their site and isolated the common charges as specified in each one-bedroom available for sale as of Nov. 5. (Neighborhoods with fewer than 10 listings were eliminated, which took all of Staten Island out of the picture.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not surprisingly, the study found that median monthlies were highest in expensive areas, where higher values translate into higher taxes, and where buildings are more likely to have amenities and staff that need to be paid for. NoHo, where the median list price for one-bedrooms was $1.8 million, had the city's highest median monthlies, $1,876 a month. The lowest were just $278 a month in Ditmas Park, Brooklyn, where the median list price was $499,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it's not quite that simple. This week's chart presents a more nuanced element of the study in which neighborhoods were ranked based on what percent of the list price monthlies made up. In this case, some of the lowest-priced neighborhoods ranked highest -- for example, the median list price for a one-bedroom in Riverdale was eight times lower than in TriBeCa, but the median common charges were very similar. So while lower prices meant mortgage payments in these areas would be lower, it also meant monthly charges would make up a larger cut of a buyer's monthly outlay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So don't be blinded by the price tag -- do the math.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Housing Market Needs More Than a Rate Cut</span>
</div><div class="author">By Ben Casselman </div><div>1308 words</div><div>1 November 2019</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2019 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low rates don't help much if you can't get a loan or can't afford a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> is hoping that its latest interest-rate cut will help keep the economy safely at cruising altitude. But don't expect it to provide much of a lift to the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing is one of the pathways by which Fed policy produces results. When the central bank cuts interest rates, it encourages people to buy houses (since mortgages are cheaper) and builders to ramp up construction (since demand is strong and borrowing is easier). Those decisions then ripple through the economy, as people buy furniture, builders hire workers and brokers cash their commission checks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But housing isn't the engine it once was. The sector is a smaller part of the economy than before the financial crisis, and a smaller share of Americans are homeowners. And with rates already low, it isn't clear that a further cut by the Fed will do much for housing -- if it lowers mortgage rates at all. (More about that in a minute.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest rates still matter for housing. The Fed's first two rate cuts this year helped stabilize the housing market, which had been heading for a major slump. On Wednesday, the Commerce Department said that construction added to gross domestic product in the third quarter after six quarters of contraction. And lower rates could give another jolt to a refinancing boom that has injected billions of dollars into the economy in recent months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But few economists expect the housing market to take off in response to this week's rate cut, because rates aren't what was holding back housing in the first place. Instead, they point to other factors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's hard to get a mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest rates don't matter if no one will give you a loan in the first place. And a lot of would-be buyers are in that situation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the housing bubble burst over a decade ago, banks and other financial institutions became far more cautious in their lending, partly because of new federal rules meant to discourage risky loans. No one wants a return of the bubble-era ''liar loans,'' for which borrowers were allowed to state their income without verification. But some argue that the pendulum has swung too far the other way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The typical home buyer today has a FICO credit score of 741, compared with 700 before the housing crisis, according to data from the Urban Institute. Hardly any buyers have a score below 650. Other measures of affordability likewise show that lending standards have loosened a bit in recent years but remain tighter than in the early 2000s, before the subprime lending boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are a lot of people that have the income to afford their payments, they could be responsible homeowners, but they may have a lower FICO score, they may have a smaller down payment, and that really holds them back,'' said Melissa Stegman, a lawyer at the <span class="companylink">Center for Responsible Lending</span>, an advocacy group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jewell Handy has a steady income as a teacher, money for a down payment and even a history of successful homeownership. But when she decided to buy a house for herself and her mother in Houston this summer, she discovered that she couldn't get a conventional mortgage. The reason: a credit score in the mid-600s because of an old issue with a student loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Handy eventually got approval for a more expensive loan through the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span>. But with a week left before the sale is scheduled to close, she is still fielding paperwork requests from her lender, and she isn't sure the loan will go through.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They're somehow not confident in my finances, but I don't really understand why,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tight lending standards disproportionately affect African-Americans like Ms. Handy. Black workers earn less on average than white workers, and they are less likely to have well-to-do family members who can help with a down payment. The homeownership rate among black Americans tumbled during the housing market's collapse and has barely recovered, even as whites and other racial groups have made progress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Glenn Kelman, chief executive of the online brokerage Redfin, said the combination of low interest rates and tight lending standards was exacerbating existing economic divides.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Right now, money's really cheap, but you have to have a good credit score to be able to access it,'' he said. ''It's been a bonanza for one group of people, the people who have always been able to get credit.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's hard to find a house to buy (at least one you can afford).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing prices have risen faster than wages in much of the country in recent years. And many cities, particularly on the coasts, are in the midst of a full-blown affordability crisis. In cities like San Francisco, Seattle and Boston, the median price of a home listed for sale is well over half a million dollars, according to the real estate site Zillow, and even starter homes can top $300,000 -- if there are any available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At those prices, a modest dip in interest rates will hardly make a difference, said Susan M. Wachter, a professor of real estate at the University of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This interest-rate decline will not do it -- it will not turn these potential owners into buyers,'' she said. ''Lower interest-rate costs are not effectively overcoming these affordability barriers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The escalation in prices is a particular challenge for first-time home buyers, who must struggle to come up with an ever-larger down payment. And while price appreciation has slowed somewhat over the past year in many markets, that isn't true for entry-level homes, which are still seeing low inventories and rapid price growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The few entry-level homes that are on the market are getting snapped up so quickly that it perpetuates the increasing home values in some of these markets,'' said Matt Speakman, an economist at Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rates are already low (and may not get much lower).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest rates on conventional mortgages have fallen sharply since late last year, in part because of the Fed's rate cuts. That has encouraged borrowing: Lenders extended $700 billion in mortgage loans in the third quarter, the most since the financial crisis. Most of that surge came in refinancing, but there has been an increase in home buying as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with rates near record lows, it's unlikely that many would-be buyers are on the sidelines awaiting a further cut. And if they are waiting, they might be disappointed -- many economists say financial markets have already ''priced in'' Wednesday's rate cut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm skeptical that rate cuts are going to have any noticeable impact on housing in the short-run,'' said Ralph McLaughlin, deputy chief economist for CoreLogic, a real estate data provider.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's another catch: Mortgage rates are tied not to short-term rates, which the Fed directly controls, but instead to long-term rates, which partly reflect market expectations about the economy's direction -- long-term rates tend to rise when investors are more optimistic. So if the Fed's policy achieves its broader aim, it can lead to higher mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has already begun to happen. Mortgage rates have edged upward since September as fears about an imminent recession eased. Michael Fratantoni, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers' Association, said he expected rates to continue to rise gradually.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Home sales in the United States fell 2.2 percent in September, as rising prices and lower inventories have stifled home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said on Tuesday that homes sold last month declined at a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 5.38 million units, ending two months of gains. Existing-home sales are up 3.9 percent from a year ago, but September's stumble shows the limits of the boost that declining mortgage rates had been providing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As average mortgage rates have fallen nearly a whole percentage point in a year, to 3.61 percent in September, economists say higher prices and a lack of listings, particularly at the lower-priced end of the market, have put a ceiling on the growth that took place past summer.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Home Sales in U.S. Rose 7.1% in August</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home sales in the United States increased 7.1 percent in August, as low mortgage rates pulled buyers into the housing market. The Commerce Department said Wednesday that sales of new homes rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 713,000, up from a revised 666,000 in July. So far this year, sales have grown a healthy 6.4 percent. Trade tensions and slower economic growth have lowered interest rates, helping home buyers. But new construction has yet to meet the demand from likely buyers, so the sales gains could translate into higher prices. August's average sales price rose 6.1 percent from a year ago to $404,200, a record level not adjusted for inflation. Economists said there was a shortage of affordable homes available to buy. Home sales climbed in the South and the West, but slipped in the Northeast and the Midwest. The 16.5 percent monthly sales gain in the more expensive West was reflected by an increase in purchases of homes priced above $400,000 relative to July. ASSOCIATED PRESS</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jim Tankersley and Ben Casselman </div><div>1721 words</div><div>6 August 2019</div><div>International New York Times</div><div>INHT</div><div>English</div><div>© 2019 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Trump’s tax cuts encouraged homeowners to stop deducting mortgage interest on their taxes, and there is no sign the change has brought down home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PLAINFIELD, Ill. — The mortgage-interest deduction, a beloved tax break bound tightly to the American dream of homeownership, once seemed politically invincible. Then it nearly vanished in middle-class neighborhoods across the country, and it appears that hardly anyone noticed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In places like Plainfield, a southwestern outpost in the area known locally as Chicagoland, the housing market is humming. The people selling and buying homes do not seem to care much that President Trump’s signature tax overhaul effectively, although indirectly, vaporized a longtime source of government support for homeowners and housing prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2017 law nearly doubled the standard deduction — to $24,000 for a couple filing jointly — on federal income taxes, giving millions of households an incentive to stop claiming itemized deductions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, far fewer families — and, in particular, far fewer middle-class families — are claiming the itemized deduction for mortgage interest. In 2018, about one in five taxpayers claimed the deduction, <span class="companylink">Internal Revenue Service</span> statistics show. This year, that number fell to less than one in 10. For families earning less than $100,000, the decline was even more stark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The benefit, as it remains, is largely for high earners, and more limited than it once was: The 2017 law capped the maximum value of new mortgage debt eligible for the deduction at $750,000, down from $1 million. There has been no audible public outcry, prompting some people in Washington to propose scrapping the tax break entirely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the deduction’s decline should be causing a stir anywhere, it is in towns like Plainfield, where the typical family earns about $100,000 a year and the typical home sells for around $300,000. But housing professionals, home buyers and sellers — and detailed statistics about the housing market — show no signs that the drop in the use of the tax break is weighing on prices or activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“From the perspective of selling and trying to buy, I don’t see any evidence of that,” said Paul Forsythe, who teaches physical education and coaches football at a high school.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Forsythe and his wife, Kylie, are selling their four-bedroom, two-bath home on a quarter-acre lot in one of Plainfield’s older developments, which dates to 1997. They are moving with their two daughters to a nearby suburb, closer to the schools where they work. They have owned homes through the ups and downs of the local housing market, which boomed in the early 2000s and crashed in the midst of the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Right now,” said Ms. Forsythe, a fourth-grade teacher, “people are excited that the market is finally good again.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such reactions challenge a longstanding American political consensus. For decades, the mortgage-interest deduction has been alternately hailed as a linchpin of support for homeownership (by the real estate industry) and reviled as a symbol of tax policy gone awry (by economists). What pretty much everyone agreed on, though, was that it was politically untouchable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly 30 million tax filers wrote off a collective $273 billion in mortgage interest in 2018. Repealing the deduction, the conventional wisdom presumed, would effectively mean raising taxes on millions of middle-class families spread across every congressional district. And if anyone were tempted to try, an army of real estate brokers, home builders and developers — and their lobbyists — were ready to rush to the deduction’s defense.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, critics of the deduction feel emboldened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The rejoinder was always, ‘Oh, but you’d never be able to get rid of the mortgage-interest deduction,’ but I certainly wouldn’t say never now,” said William G. Gale, an economist at the <span class="companylink">Brookings Institution</span> and a former adviser to President George H.W. Bush. “It used to be that this was a middle-class birthright or something like that, but it’s kind of hard to argue that when only 8 percent of households are taking the deduction.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gale, like most economists on the left and the right, has long argued that the mortgage-interest deduction violated every rule of good policymaking. It was regressive, benefiting wealthy families — who are more likely to own homes, and to have bigger mortgages — more than poorer ones. It distorted the housing market, encouraging Americans to buy the biggest home possible to take maximum advantage of the deduction. Studies repeatedly found that the deduction actually reduced ownership rates by helping to inflate home prices, making homes less affordable to first-time buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the real estate industry said that scrapping the deduction could undermine the value of what is, for most American families, their most important asset. In the debate over the tax law in 2017, the industry warned[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/21/business/economy/tax-real-estate.html] that the legislation could cause house prices to fall 10 percent or more in some parts of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Price growth has cooled[https://us.spindices.com/index-family/real-estate/sp-corelogic-case-shiller]
 in many markets[https://us.spindices.com/index-family/real-estate/sp-corelogic-case-shiller], including New York and Seattle, but not nearly as much as the most alarming estimates[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/21/business/economy/tax-real-estate.html] suggested, and not in a pattern that suggests the loss of the deduction was a primary factor. Places where a large share of middle-class taxpayers took the mortgage-interest deduction, for example, have not seen any meaningful difference in price increases from less-affected areas, according to a <span class="companylink">New York Times</span> analysis of data from the real estate site Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Skylar Olsen, an economist at Zillow, said that the slowdown in the housing market probably had little to do with the tax law. Home prices have risen much faster than wages in recent years, creating an affordability crisis in many cities[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/29/business/economy/home-prices-housing-market-slowdown.html] that probably made slower growth in prices inevitable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Housing markets were burning so hot at an unsustainable pace and they had to come down,” Ms. Olsen said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax law may have had another impact: It capped deductions for state and local taxes at $10,000, which had a particularly large effect in coastal cities and other places where property taxes and real estate values are both high. Those places did see a slowdown in the growth of home prices after the law took effect, although it is not clear whether the two were linked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national real estate industry argues that the two tax changes have together played a role in weakening the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Clearly the housing market is underperforming in relation to economic fundamentals of job growth, wage growth and mortgage rates,” said Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists like Mr. Yun and Ms. Olsen will probably debate the law’s impact for years. It is possible, and even likely, that sophisticated analyses will eventually conclude that limiting the mortgage-interest deduction did lead to somewhat slower price growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for most home buyers and sellers, those subtle effects will be washed away by forces that have a much bigger impact: changes to mortgage rates, construction costs and supply and demand trends that vary from city to city and from neighborhood to neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax law also rolled back the mortgage-interest deduction in a way that minimized the chance that taxpayers would notice its absence. Congress did not take away the tax break; it just changed the law in a way that meant fewer people would benefit from it — and buried the change in a much broader overhaul to the tax code.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while Washington think tanks plot the deduction’s demise, the real estate industry is still hoping to restore it in some form. Mr. Yun of the National Association for Realtors said that as the housing market weakened, pressure would mount for Congress to restore some of the tax advantages that homeownership has historically enjoyed, although not necessarily in the same form.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, though, real estate agents and developers do not see the erosion of the mortgage deduction playing much of a role.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plainfield’s housing market has been shaped by abrupt changes over the past 30 years. In 1990, a tornado leveled parts of town[https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/30/us/cleanup-begins-at-tornado-site-where-25-died.html], killing more than two dozen people and forcing a huge rebuilding effort. At the turn of the millennium, the town had fewer than 10,000 residents. It has since quadrupled, with more growth on the way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the housing craze of the mid-2000s, developers leveled corn fields and sod farms to make way for cul-de-sacs. When the crisis hit, activity in many of the new subdivisions froze, said Ellen Williams, a real estate agent with <span class="companylink">Coldwell Banker</span> in Plainfield who has sold homes in the area for nearly two decades. Only in the past few years has construction restarted in earnest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Williams helped the Forsythes buy their home several years ago, when the housing crash still weighed on the market and the couple was underwater on a townhouse that had become too small for their growing family. They rent the townhouse out now, which means that they still itemize their deductions, including for mortgage interest. They said the deduction was not a factor in the sale of their home this summer or in their purchase of a new one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Williams said that has been the case across the market. “I don’t know that it’s been a huge enough change yet,” she said. “People worry about Illinois taxes more.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Forsythes’ ZIP code, housing prices are up 2 percent from the last year, according to data from the online real estate brokerage Redfin. Homes are selling quickly, Ms. Williams said, as she gave a quick tour of a recently listed four-bedroom house backing up to a pond in a nearby community. The hardwood floors were well kept, the kitchen hardware dated to the mid-1990s and the home was listed for $267,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There’s not a lot available in this subdivision,” Ms. Williams said, “so I anticipate it selling quickly.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cheaper mortgages are usually a boon to the housing market. But this year, a sharp drop in mortgage rates hasn't provided much of a lift, and that could bode poorly for the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>'s efforts to shore up economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To see why, take a look at what has happened in housing since mortgage rates began a sharp decline late last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer borrowing costs, including mortgage rates, are heavily influenced by the market for government bonds, and yields on those bonds have been falling this year. Similarly, the rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage rate is down more than one percentage point, to 3.75 percent last week, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the last 30 years, the rate has averaged about 6.25 percent. So the current rates might reasonably have been expected to spark a flurry of refinancing and home buying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, because of rising home prices, there has been no boom so far. Through June, sales of existing homes were down 2 percent from a year earlier, and investment in residential structures had declined for six straight quarters. Sales of newly built homes remain well below their recent peak in late 2017. And while home prices are still rising nationwide, the gains have slowed sharply in recent months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lackluster response to lower mortgage rates highlights a broader challenge facing the Fed as it tries to nudge the American economy along by cutting interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower rates usually encourage borrowing by consumers and corporations, lift stock and bond markets, and reinforce consumer and corporate confidence. All of which gives a bit of gas to the American economic engine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But 10 years into an economic recovery, American interest rates are already low by historical standards. Prices for stocks and bonds are already high. And corporations are having little trouble finding places to borrow money. Such loose financial conditions mean it might take a sustained program of rate cuts -- rather than a couple of reductions, as many analysts expect -- for the Fed to have a true impact on the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Financial conditions are just easy all around,'' said Priya Misra, head of global rates strategy at <span class="companylink">TD Securities</span> in New York. ''So it's not clear what a cut can do.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has traditionally been one of the most important channels by which the Fed's rates can influence the economy because it can spur construction employment, sales of appliances and furniture, and services such as landscaping, all of which multiply the economic impact of a home's purchase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the math facing prospective American home buyers is daunting. Since June 2009, when the United States economy started its current expansion, the median price of existing homes has risen nearly 60 percent, far outpacing the 24 percent gain in median weekly earnings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The divergence means the national housing market -- while incredibly varied on a local level -- has become increasingly unaffordable. And it will take more to trigger a significant wave of home buying than clipping a percentage point off mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''At this point, they don't matter as much as people think,'' said John Sim, an analyst who covers housing and the mortgage market for <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span>. ''Even at this current level of rates, it's pretty unaffordable to most renters.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing bust a decade ago is partly to blame. Since 2008, homebuilders have largely cut back on building more modest starter homes, which would be attractive to first-time buyers but are less profitable for the builders. Historically, banks might have filled the gap by loosening lending standards so people could pay higher prices. But financial firms have, for the most part, stuck to stricter guidelines they put in place at the urging of regulators in the wake of the crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result has been a sharp downturn in homeownership, to 64 percent from an elevated level of 69 percent during the subprime-lending-fueled frenzy in the middle of the last decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In general what we've had is just not enough lower-priced homes and sort of a vicious cycle, where that limited supply has continued pushing prices up,'' said Jody Shenn, an analyst at credit rating firm <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> who covers the housing and mortgage industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not that the decline in interest rates doesn't matter at all. The drop since late 2018 to 3.75 percent has knocked about $160 off a monthly mortgage payment on a $286,000 home -- the median price of existing single-family homes in June, according to the National Association of Realtors -- after a 20 percent down payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Applications to buy homes and refinance mortgages, which were slumping late last year, have recovered somewhat since mortgage rates began declining. It's possible the drop in mortgage rates might simply need more time to influence the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the market response so far seems muted compared with past instances of falling rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a recession hit in 2001, for example, a series of rate cuts brought the Fed's target for the its funds rate down to 1 percent from 6.5 percent. Mortgage rates followed, dropping from 8.5 percent to around 5 percent by mid-2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The low rates set off home building, consumer spending and financial activity that helped drive economic growth up to a nearly 7 percent annual pace in late 2003. The American economy hasn't matched that level since.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the reaction of the housing market to lower rates remains lackluster, it suggests the Fed's may be less effective at fighting the next economic slowdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The old view of the world, where housing is one of the key transmission mechanisms, is much less important than it used to be,'' said Frederic Mishkin, a Columbia University finance professor and former Fed official.</p>
<p>Despite a drop in mortgage rates, sales of existing homes in the first half of 2019 were down 2 percent from a year earlier. Increasingly unaffordable prices have forestalled any potential boom in home buying. (PHOTOGRAPH BY JOE RAEDLE/GETTY IMAGES) (B4) </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home building has barely kept pace with the number of new households -- a household ''consists of all the people who occupy a housing unit,'' according to the U.S. Census -- in the United States over the last eight years, and much of what is being built is aimed at the higher end of the market, according to a report released this week by the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing construction bottomed out in 2011, with just 633,000 new units built in the U.S. It has improved since then, with 1.2 million new units built in 2018, but to find a year before the recession when fewer than 1.2 million homes were produced, you would have to look all the way back to 1982.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aside from the general lag in construction, the report stressed that smaller, affordable new housing has been in especially short supply, as rising costs and regulatory restrictions have made building it less profitable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent study by the <span class="companylink">Urban Land Institute</span>, a research-driven think tank, reached similar conclusions, showing that creation of new ''attainable housing'' has dried up in recent decades, replaced by the construction of larger, more expensive homes. (The organization defines ''attainable housing'' as unsubsidized, for-sale housing affordable to households with incomes that fall between 80 and 120 percent of the median income in a given area.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gap between what is being built and what is needed is particularly evident if you compare the size of households in the country and the bedroom counts in new construction. While households with fewer members have been on the rise over the last 30 years -- between 1987 and 2017, one-person households quintupled and two-person households tripled -- the share of new one- and two-bedroom homes has been cut nearly in half.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite Trade Tensions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer confidence jumped in May as households grew more upbeat about the labor market, suggesting the economy remained on solid ground despite signs that activity was slowing after being temporarily bolstered by exports and a buildup of inventories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surge in confidence reported by the <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span> on Tuesday came despite an escalation in tensions in the 10-month trade war between the United States and China.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span> said its index of consumer attitudes increased 4.9 points to a reading of 134.1 this month, climbing up to levels seen last November when the index was hovering near 18-year highs.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of New Homes Rise</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For 3rd Month in a Row</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes in the United States increased 4.5 percent in March, the third straight monthly gain as the housing market appears to be cautiously recovering from a mortgage rate spike last year that caused home buying to slump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said Tuesday that new homes sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 692,000 in March, up from 662,000 in February. For the first three months of 2019, new-home sales were 1.7 percent higher than the same period a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">March's sales pace was the strongest since November 2017, a sign that the market for newer properties is building some momentum. New-home sales began to rebound after the average 30-year mortgage rate fell from its recent peak of nearly 5 percent in November 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the housing market has been uneven in recent months, a sign that years of price gains have hurt affordability and that lower mortgage rates can only remove a degree of the pressure from higher costs. Associated Press</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Renters Are Mad. Presidential Candidates Have Noticed.</span>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Renters hold little sway in Washington. They vote at lower rates than homeowners. They’re generally represented in Congress by homeowners. They have no deep-pocketed lobbyists. And their problems, if anyone considers them at all, are typically waved off as problems for local government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s striking, then, that several Democratic candidates for president are now approaching renters in a way they’ve seldom been treated before — as a voting bloc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, senators from some of the most expensive housing markets in the country, have proposed substantial bills to alleviate the housing crisis. They’re not talking in gauzy terms about homeownership, the rare housing topic that usually gets a nod. They see unsustainable, raw-deal, skyrocketing rents, and they’re not hesitant to sermonize about it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Iowa, Ms. Warren has “wonked out” on housing economics[https://medium.com/@teamwarren/my-housing-plan-for-america-20038e19dc26?subsource=GS-67803829336-elizabeth%20warren-p-335493276610&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIsa_T6djc4QIVDlYMCh3WYAAgEAAYASAAEgL_U_D_BwE&amp;refcode=WFP2019-LB-GS-NY&amp;refcode2=GS-67803829336-elizabeth%20warren-p-335493276610], and in New Hampshire she’s talked about racial inequality in the market. Mr. Booker has invoked the book “Evicted” (he included it in his book club[https://www.facebook.com/corybooker/videos/joining-author-matthew-desmond-for-a-live-chat-qa-to-discuss-his-book-evicted-po/10157326901562228/]) and his own family’s barriers to housing (a white couple had to pose for his parents[https://www.facebook.com/corybooker/photos/id-like-to-share-a-storyin-1969-one-year-after-the-passage-of-the-fair-housing-a/10157849632522228/] when they bought their first home in New Jersey).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This spring, Ms. Harris, who has proposed a refundable tax credit for renters[https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/harris-reintroduces-legislation-to-provide-relief-to-americans-facing-skyrocketing-cost-of-rent], walked into a hotel ballroom of housing activists and policymakers in Washington for a conference of the <span class="companylink">National Low Income Housing Coalition</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I believe that the right to housing should be understood to be a fundamental right, a human right, a civil right,” she told a cheering crowd with smartphones held aloft. “Not everyone has figured that out yet, so there’s a lot of work to do to make the point.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Diane Yentel, president of the coalition, jokes that in past elections housing advocates have had to strain to hear mention of their concerns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’ve watched debates and town halls and said: ‘Oh, she said neighborhood! They’re talking about our issue. Or she said house!’ — just trying to find a way to feel hopeful,” Ms. Yentel said. There has been more talk of housing affordability early in this Democratic primary than has been the case in any presidential campaign she can remember. “It’s really remarkable,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Renters heavily overlap with key Democratic constituencies, including younger adults, African-Americans and Hispanics[https://www.census.gov/housing/hvs/data/charts/fig08.pdf], and urban residents. Voter turnout of renters in 2016 was about 12 percentage points lower than that of homeowners, according to the Cooperative Congressional Election Study. But that year they favored Hillary Clinton by 28 points (homeowners preferred Donald J. Trump by 11 points).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing researchers and renters say the climate has changed even since 2016. High rent costs have increasingly spread beyond coastal cities, and the pain is now expanding from the working class to the middle class. Housing vacancy rates are at a three-decade low. A poll commissioned by groups including the <span class="companylink">National Low Income Housing Coalition</span> found that 60 percent of people say housing affordability is a serious problem where they live[https://www.opportunityhome.org/pollpressrelease/] — up 21 points from 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What’s changed is not just the cost of rent itself, said Andrew Criscione, a 30-year-old renter in Boston. Rather, he said, people of his generation increasingly fear that annual rent increases aren’t the product of a bubble soon to burst, but that this is their indefinite reality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Now you’re seeing people like me, who 10 or 20 years ago really would be pretty comfortable,” Mr. Criscione said. He makes $55,000 a year working in communications for a college, but he shares an apartment in a run-down triple-decker with two other professionals, with one bathroom between them. “Suddenly, we’re living in these tenement-type setups, we don’t really have an escape option, all the jobs are in big cities, and every city has a rent crisis.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in much of the country declined or slowed after the housing crash. But rents just kept rising, with the added pressure of millions of people who became renters when their homes went into foreclosure. The home building industry has recovered slowly, and where new construction has picked up it has mostly added housing for the high-income market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The private markets have shifted away from entry-level housing into building McMansions, and I understand that — the reason for it is the profits are better,” Ms. Warren said in an interview. That represents a new reality from a generation ago, she said, one that demands a different approach from the federal government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’re not going to solve our housing crisis by nibbling at the edges,” she said. “We need to tackle it head-on with big comprehensive solutions that match the size of the problem we face.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her bill[https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/warren-and-colleagues-reintroduce-historic-legislation-to-confront-americas-housing-crisis], reintroduced in March and co-sponsored by another presidential candidate, Kirsten Gillibrand, includes a hefty infusion of money to nonprofit developers of affordable housing, paid for by raising the estate tax. A <span class="companylink">Moody’s</span> analysis projected that the added resources, about $50 billion a year, would help build enough new housing to push rents a decade from now about 10 percent lower than they would be without Ms. Warren’s bill. That estimate, however, treats the nation’s supply of housing as a single market, and the real effects would most likely be different in Boston and in Des Moines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Warren’s bill also includes down payment assistance to new homeowners living in neighborhoods that were historically redlined by banks, in an effort to narrow the black-white homeownership gap. She and Mr. Booker also want to nudge local communities to allow more housing by changing zoning laws that block the construction of apartments or denser housing. Such laws have the effect of maintaining economic and racial segregation, and analysts on the left and right view them as a key driver of high housing costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Warren wants to dangle a new pot of federal money to communities that change such laws. Mr. Booker’s bill would punish those that won’t, by withholding community development grants. Either proposal would mean more federal intervention in decisions long viewed as inherently local. But both Ms. Warren and Mr. Booker argue that federal policies helped shape local communities more than residents often acknowledge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“My whole life experience has been seeing how federal laws that were bigoted and biased created disinvestment in certain communities and created wealth and opportunity in others,” Mr. Booker said. “Federal policy literally helped to design cities as we know them.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It follows, he said, that the federal government should help change those patterns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That’s an argument that Mrs. Clinton sidestepped[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/18/opinion/campaign-stops/can-hillary-manage-her-unruly-coalition.html] just three years ago, even as her economic agenda[https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/housing/] included a proposal to increase federal spending on housing. In reality, the Democratic coalition also includes many homeowners who don’t want new rental housing nearby[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/21/upshot/home-ownership-nimby-bipartisan.html] — or who benefit from the tight housing supply that has driven up the value of their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Moody’s</span> analysis that Ms. Warren often cites also concludes that her bill would slow the appreciation of home prices. But in the early stages of courting renters, these candidates are not yet talking about how helping them may require concessions from more than just the people rich enough to pay estate taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That’s a huge problem for the whole zoning reform debate — there’s just no way to slice it that a vast number of wealthy, powerful people aren’t going to have to make some significant sacrifice,” said Kenneth Stahl, a law professor at Chapman University. “Candidates have to think about whether they’re going to be rewarded for going out on that limb.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Harris has not yet put herself there. She has proposed only a tax credit for renters (Mr. Booker’s bill includes one, too). That’s likely to be popular with renters. But absent policies that also try to increase supply, economists warn that any money the government gives renters will just wind up in the pockets of landlords, pushing up rents even more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jess Sheehan, a 32-year-old renter in Cambridge, Mass., who has become involved in local housing politics, says she prefers Ms. Warren’s plan for confronting the harder supply problems. But she says she loves that other candidates at least have plans. And there are reasons to expect more — from Pete Buttigieg, who should appreciate the topic as a mayor, and Julián Castro, who was a secretary of housing and urban development in the Obama administration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I hope it becomes an obvious part of the package,” Ms. Sheehan said. “How can you run for president without speaking to this?”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spring is the busiest season for home sales. If you’re interested in selling, the best time to list your home is probably in early April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to a new report from Realtor.com[https://www.realtor.com/research/first-week-of-april-best-time-to-list-home-for-sale-2019/] on property sales in the 50 largest American metropolitan areas, homes listed across the country during the first week of April received 14 percent more views online than homes listed during any other week of the year. Compared with the weekly average across the year, they also had 5 percent fewer total listings to compete with and sold at an average of six days sooner, for almost 6 percent (or $17,000) more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To determine this, the company weighed several factors for listings on its site between January 2016 and December 2018: the number of days each property spent on the market; the rate at which properties listed at various times of year sold above or below asking price; the number of online views listings received; the total number of listings at any given time; and the average listing price in each area at various times of year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a local level, of course, the results varied. But while there were a number of exceptions, the best time to list a home in most of the cities the study examined was in April.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Rebound, Home Sales</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Surged 11.8% in February</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales soared 11.8 percent in February, aided by accelerating wages and falling mortgage rates that are improving affordability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Friday that existing homes sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.51 million last month, a sharp rebound from a pace of 4.94 million in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The burst in sales points to the housing market regaining the momentum that it lost in mid-2018, after a spike in rates for home loans caused sales to slow. The February sales figures point toward growth in sales of homes priced from $250,000 to$500,000, a range that is generally affordable to middle-class families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, existing-home sales are down 1.8 percent from a year ago because of the severity of last year's slowdown. But 30-year mortgage rates have since tumbled after peaking in November at roughly 5 percent, helping sales to recover as that average has fallen to 4.28 percent this week, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Health care companies led stocks lower on Wall Street on Monday as investors waited for more details on reports that the United States and China are moving closer to a deal to resolve their costly trade dispute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sell-off was most pronounced in sectors that have shown strong gains over the last two months, including health care and technology. Financial stocks also took heavy losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The world's two largest economies have pulled back from an immediate escalation of their damaging trade war since they started negotiating last month. President Trump postponed a deadline for raising tariffs on more Chinese goods, citing progress. Now, media reports say the nations could strike a deal this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The devil is still in the details, and those details are still pretty sparse at this point,'' said David Lefkowitz, senior Americas equity strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management. ''When tariffs might be removed is definitely a key question, and also there's still some uncertainty about whether or not a deal will be consummated.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P 500 index dropped 10.88 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,792.81. The index, a benchmark for many mutual funds, is still up 11.4 percent so far this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> industrial average fell 206.67 points, or 0.8 percent, to 25,819.65. The average was briefly down more than 414 points.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors have been hoping for a resolution in the long-running trade dispute between the world's biggest economies, which centers on China's technological ambitions. Washington claims Beijing is stealing technology and forcing companies to turn over technology in order to do business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Optimism that a trade pact could be finalized soon gave markets an early boost Monday, but the rally faded as traders sized up mixed construction spending data for the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said construction spending edged down 0.6 percent in December amid declines in residential construction and government projects. Even with the December setback, construction spending for all of 2018 reached record levels, though it was the smallest increase seven years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The construction spending report was good news for homebuilders, which bucked the broader market trend. <span class="companylink">PulteGroup</span> climbed 3.5 percent, while <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton</span> rose 3.1 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Health care stocks led the sell-off among companies in the S&amp;P 500. <span class="companylink">UnitedHealth Group</span> slid 4.1 percent, the biggest loss among the 30 stocks in the Dow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Technology companies and banks also fell. <span class="companylink">Salesforce.com</span> sank 3.7 percent and <span class="companylink">Charles Schwab</span> lost 2.5 percent.</p>

</div><div class="author">By ROB SASS </div><div>1019 words</div><div>1 March 2019</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2019 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five years ago, the classic car market had just completed a turnaround that left even seasoned observers surprised by its speed. The deep recession that began in 2007 had dealt the same initial blow to vintage car prices that it did to the Dow and to the real estate market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The downturn erased four or five years' worth of gains for collectible cars, by many estimates. But by 2014, most had fully recouped their pre-recession values, and the market has maintained an even keel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are some signs, however, that the good times may be coming to an end. A mix of factors is at play, including demographics, changes to tax laws and general uncertainty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For auctions in 2018 and early 2019, the sell-through rate (the percentage of cars meeting reserve and selling) for million-dollar-plus cars has dropped about 20 percent from the previous year, according to Hagerty, a classic-car insurer in Michigan. That's the lowest rate since Hagerty started tracking the statistic in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The wealthiest and most discriminating collectors may simply be taking a pass on the current offerings, or ''it may be a sign that the savviest collectors are sensing a change in the tone of the market,'' said Brian Rabold, vice president for valuation at Hagerty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the recent crop of cars isn't persuading elite collectors to raise their paddles, the question then becomes why aren't more owners of blue-chip cars selling them?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cam Ingram, a collector and restorer in North Carolina, pointed to last year's changes in Section 1031 of the tax code, which had allowed the capital gains tax on a sale to be deferred if the proceeds were used to buy another collectible -- artwork, say, or cars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One factor that few people are acknowledging at the moment is the effect of the loss of 1031 exchanges,'' Mr. Ingram said. ''Top collectors were able to strategically play with positions in their collections to avoid realizing taxes on gains. Now they have to be far more disciplined. The change in the law is affecting both supply and demand.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the economy still running strong, he added, few top collectors are in a position where they need to sell to free up cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both Mr. Ingram and Michael Sheehan, a dealer-broker of vintage Ferraris in Southern California, acknowledged the perception among top collectors that now might be the time to hold the best of the best. When those cars do sell, they often do so off the radar and at still very robust prices, they said. Private sales have always taken place among elite collectors, but now comparatively few big private sales are the exception to the general rule that the top of the market is cooling off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demographics, too, are influencing this market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Every day, I get the same calls: Guy dies, his kids don't want the cars, and they want me to sell them. Or it's knee surgery, hip surgery or prostate cancer and the owner simply can't enjoy the car anymore,'' Mr. Sheehan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What Mr. Sheehan describes is most likely the vanguard of a wave of baby boomers getting out of the market, and nobody seems to have a clear idea of what comes next.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the classic-car market rebounded after the recession, it was still boomer-driven, and the very top end came back first, in 2011, according to Hagerty data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The stock market was still in a slump, and cars were being talked about as one of the few asset classes where good returns could be had,'' Mr. Ingram said. ''By the next year, the middle of the market (cars costing between $250,000 and $1 million) returned to health, and the year after that, the entry level got active again.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there is a shift now, it's still in its early days, and the market may be mirroring its resurgence from 2011 to 2013. The broad entry level continues to be robust, according to Mr. Ingram and Mr. Rabold, while the top end is sluggish, a possible leading indicator of a general slump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The United States economy is in its longest period of growth on record, and most observers predict a downturn reasonably soon. That would certainly affect the classic-car market. But it's the demographic shift, combined with the potential for another 2008-like crash, that seems to worry the keenest market-watchers the most.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Several things are in play here,'' Mr. Sheehan said. ''There's general uncertainty and concern about things like the world economy and Brexit. The boomers are leaving the market in droves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Younger people can't drive a stick shift,'' he added, ''and they can't afford the cars at the level that the boomers have driven the prices to -- they're busy paying record money for housing, education debt and health care.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the moment, the market seems to be in a holding pattern.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Gen-Xers and millennials are still priced out of the market,'' Mr. Sheehan said. ''The last time that the market corrected, in 2008, it turned around quickly after it became apparent that the recession wouldn't turn into a depression. Baby boomer money was still in play, and it quickly drove prices back to pre-correction levels.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That may not happen again. ''The boomers aren't going to be around to prop the market back up after the next one,'' Mr. Sheehan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What it all means is debatable. Mr. Ingram and Mr. Sheehan both believe that some form of correction is inevitable as baby boomers complete their exit from the market over the next 10 to 15 years. Their cars aren't going to disappear, but their ability to spend will.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''How Gen-Xers and millennials will value those cars,'' Mr. Ingram said, ''is the $64,000 question.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing Starts Plummet</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To Lowest Level Since '16</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes being built in December plunged to the lowest level in more than two years, a possible sign that developers are anticipating fewer new houses to be sold this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said Tuesday that housing starts fell 11.2 percent in December from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate 1.08 million. This is the slowest pace of construction since September 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past 12 months, housing starts have tumbled 10.2 percent. December's decline occurred for single-family houses and apartment buildings. Builders have pulled back as higher prices have caused home sales to slump, suggesting that affordability challenges have caused the pool of would-be buyers and renters to dwindle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market cooled last year as 30-year mortgage rates reached nearly 5 percent. But rates have fallen recently, and that may lift sales in 2019. Associated Press</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Fraud Case Is Delayed</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trial of former Platinum Partners chief Mark Nordlicht and three other executives of the now-defunct hedge fund group, who are accused of defrauding investors out of $1 billion, has been postponed until April 15.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trial, which had been set to begin on Tuesday, was delayed because of ''a medical issue relating to an individual involved in this case,'' according to a written order issued by Federal District Judge Brian Cogan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also charged are David Levy, who was Platinum's co-chief investment officer; Joseph SanFilippo, who was chief financial officer of Platinum's flagship Value Arbitrage fund; and Daniel Small, who was a Platinum managing director. All four defendants have pleaded not guilty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The executives are accused of orchestrating two schemes. One involved allegedly overvaluing Platinum's assets to collect higher fees. Another involved defrauding bondholders of Black Elk, a Platinum-controlled oil exploration company, out of $50 million, prosecutors said. Reuters</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest moves to shrink the business come as the department store chain reported a drop in profits and total sales during the critical fourth quarter as well as meager growth in sales at established stores, a key measure for a retailer's health.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> policymakers took a gloomy view on the eurozone economy at their last policy meeting and asked for swift preparations for giving banks more long-term loans, minutes of the meeting showed on Thursday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home sales fell 1.2 percent in January to their worst pace in over three years, as persistent affordability problems have put a chill in the real estate market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said Thursday that sales of existing homes declined 1.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.94 million last month, the slowest sales rate since November 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the past 12 months, sales have plunged 8.5 percent. Would-be home buyers are increasingly priced out of the market as years of climbing prices and strained inventories have made ownership too costly. A solid job market has done little to boost sales, with the sharpest annual sales declines being among homes priced less than $250,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''January's weak sales pace was likely the result of the lingering effects of stock market volatility and lower consumer confidence toward the end of 2018,'' said Joel Kan, associate vice president of industry surveys and forecasts at the Mortgage Bankers Association.

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Housing Is Already in a Slump. So It (Probably) Can’t Cause a Recession.</span>
</div><div class="author">By Conor Dougherty </div><div>1471 words</div><div>21 February 2019</div><div>International New York Times</div><div>INHT</div><div>English</div><div>© 2019 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The United States has had 11 recessions since the end of World War II. All but two were preceded by a big decline in the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inside that bit of trivia lie some fundamental insights into housing’s outsize role in the business cycle, along with clues to suggest that the economy is on firmer footing than the increasingly pessimistic forecasts make it seem. The gist is this: The United States may or may not enter a recession this year, but if it does, housing is unlikely to be the cause, because it never really recovered in the first place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Housing is not in a position to lead this thing down,” said Edward Leamer, an economics professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How much it can help prolong the overall recovery is another matter. Home sales and prices have been sluggish in the face of rising interest rates. Still, the pace of construction, combined with pent-up demand from young adults, suggests that the sector should at least remain stable in the face of uncertainty elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why is housing so often a focus of anxiety as economic expansions run their course? Here are a few reasons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing is more volatile than bigger sectors</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though housing does not account for all that much of the economy, its role in recessions is huge, because it is highly cyclical and sensitive to interest rates. Think of expansions and recessions as the cycle of things that go up and down a lot. Housing is a big determinant of where that cycle is headed because, unlike many other sectors, it has wide swings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing sector accounts for as little as 3 percent of economic output during recessions and about twice that during booms. Other pieces of the economy are much bigger, but they don’t change nearly as much from boom to bust. Government spending, for instance, has hovered between 17 percent and 20 percent of the economy for decades. The three-percentage-point swing is about the same in each case, but government accounts for much more of the economy. Translation: Housing punches way above its weight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, while housing has never accounted for more than 7 percent of total output, it has on average accounted for about a quarter of the weakness in recessions since World War II, according to a 2007 paper by Mr. Leamer titled “Housing IS the Business Cycle[https://www.nber.org/papers/w13428].”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After housing, the sector that has historically been second most important to recessions is consumer durables, or expensive purchases like cars, furniture and appliances. Those are often connected to the housing market’s prosperity because people usually buy other things when they purchase a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes downturns have other causes, but they only underscore housing’s role in economic cycles. The 1953 recession followed a decline in government spending after the Korean War, and the 2001 recession was driven by a decline in business spending after the dot-com bubble popped. Both were relatively brief and shallow — the 2001 recession was the least severe since World War II — in part because housing investment remained stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most recent recession, from 2007 to 2009, offered one of the more exaggerated examples of housing’s guiding role in downturns. A recent report from the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis</span> found that the construction sector accounted for a little over a third of the decline in output in the past recession, and about half of the job losses[https://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/economic-synopses/2018/12/28/industry-connectivity-a-case-study-of-the-construction-industry] (a figure that includes laid-off construction workers and job losses in connected industries).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How does housing look now? Mixed, but mixed in such a way that the things most important to economic growth are the most stable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices have been discouraging buyers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Measured in sales and prices, the housing sector appears to be in a precarious position. Existing-home sales were down about 10 percent[https://www.nar.realtor/newsroom/existing-home-sales-see-64-percent-drop-in-december] in December from a year earlier, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. The group blamed rising prices and interest rates, and a lack of supply that has left buyers underwhelmed by their choices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the problem is that while job growth has been strong, home prices have gone up faster than incomes[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/29/business/economy/home-prices-housing-market-slowdown.html].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices have gone up so far so fast that even markets previously considered affordable are beyond the reach of many buyers. Home prices have risen by about 50 percent since 2012, according to Zillow, and many of the more affordable markets have shot up even faster. In Phoenix, home values have doubled since 2012, not adjusted for inflation. The Denver market is up 90 percent, Atlanta 84 percent, Nashville 78 percent and Dallas 76 percent. If people can’t afford a home in Texas, where can they?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sticker shock of rising prices, combined with rising interest rates that make monthly payments more expensive, scared off many buyers toward the end of last year. Some of that demand seemed to come back at the start of the year, after interest rates fell to roughly where they were a year ago[http://www.freddiemac.com/pmms/].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, homes are sitting on the market longer, price cuts are becoming more common, and a number of homebuilders have had layoffs[https://www.builderonline.com/builder-100/leadership/builders-continue-layoffs_o]. Before a recent speech to 1,000 people from the housing industry, John Burns, founder of <span class="companylink">John Burns Real Estate Consulting</span>, asked the members of the audience to forecast the year ahead. They were evenly split between those seeing sales and price declines and those seeing growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Everybody is being really cautious right now,” Mr. Burns said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This all sounds very bad, but for anyone who isn’t trying to sell a home or in the business of selling homes, it’s not as bad as it seems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders are less bullish than in the past</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When economists talk about a recession in housing, they largely refer to construction, not home prices. Most of the industry’s contribution to annual gross domestic product lies in residential fixed investment, a category composed almost entirely of the building of single-family homes and apartment and condominium buildings (along with a small amount of home improvements and renovations).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising home prices help the economy in small but important ways, like making people feel richer and building up home equity that owners can tap and spend elsewhere. But increased spending from people feeling richer is not nearly as important as the pace of home sales and the volume of construction, since both of those create many jobs — for people like real estate agents and mortgage brokers on the sales side, and the architects, construction workers, electricians, plumbers and others who design and build new homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home buying is weak and getting weaker, so that could be a concern. But construction is bordering on moribund. Total housing starts grew at an annual rate of 1.2 million a year in January, more than double the recession-era low of less than 500,000, but still well below an average of 1.5 million from 1990 to the start of the housing bust — despite an expanding population.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clearly the need for housing is there, so why aren’t builders building more? That is a confounding question.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During conference calls to announce their earnings, publicly traded builders like <span class="companylink">D.R. Horton</span> and <span class="companylink">PulteGroup</span> have said much the same thing as real estate agents, which is that buyers are put off by higher prices and creeping interest rates. Many builders also cite local regulations that make it harder to build homes in denser areas closer to jobs, and higher labor costs in a tight job market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The overall message is that builders cannot build homes at the prices people want in the places people want them, so they aren’t building much at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The largest demand for housing is at the lower end of the market, the hardest to serve profitably, although in conference calls a number of builders said they were shifting some of their building and land buying toward cheaper, smaller homes. This may or may not improve the pace of building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result is that the housing sector — the residential construction components of G.D.P., taken together — accounted for only 3.9 percent of the economy in the third quarter, and has helped drag down overall economic output for three quarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words: Housing is in recession already. It might not get better soon, but it probably won’t get worse.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Interest Rates Rose</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales declined in 2018 as the combination of higher mortgage rates, relatively low inventories and price gains consistently outpaced wage growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average mortgage rates have dropped from recent highs of nearly 5 percent. It's unclear whether that will be enough to revitalize buyer demand because of a decrease in the sales listings of homes that median-income families can afford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales in 2018 tumbled 3.1 percent from the previous year, to 5.34 million units, the worst showing since 2015. The outlook for home buying was complicated in December by stock market self-offs and volatile changes in mortgage rates. Investors grappled with a slowdown in global economic growth.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Boeing</span>, bolstered by strong demand for airliners and military planes, faces a difficult decision over whether to develop a new plane to fill in a gap in its lineup.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boeing's chief executive, Dennis Muilenburg, said the plane could replace less fuel-efficient bigger planes and let airlines launch new midrange routes.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Growth in Home Prices Slowed in October</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home price growth slowed in October, a likely consequence of higher mortgage rates having worsened affordability and causing sales to fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S&amp;P <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> Case-Shiller 20-city home price index rose 5 percent from a year earlier, down from an annual gain of 5.2 percent in September, according to a Wednesday report.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We are, once again, experiencing one of the greatest housing booms in United States history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How long this will last and where it is heading next are impossible to know now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it is time to take notice: My data shows that this is the United States' third biggest housing boom in the modern era.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since February 2012, when the price declines associated with the last financial crisis ended, prices for existing homes in the United States have been rising steadily and enormously. According to the S&amp;P/<span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> /Case-Shiller National Home Price Index (which I helped to create) as of September, the prices were 53 percent higher than they were at the bottom of the market in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That means, on average, a house that sold for, say, $200,000 in 2012 would bring over $300,000 in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even after factoring in Consumer Price Index inflation, real existing home prices were up almost 40 percent during that period. That is a substantial increase in less than seven years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, based on my data, it amounts to the third strongest national boom in real terms since the Consumer Price Index began in 1913, behind only the explosive run-up in prices that led to the great financial crisis of a decade ago, and one connected with World War II and the great postwar Baby Boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The No. 1 boom occurred from February 1997 to October 2006, when real prices of existing United States homes rose 74 percent. This was a period of intense speculative enthusiasm -- for houses and for financial instruments based on mortgages as investments -- and it was also a time of great regulatory complacency. The term ''flipping houses'' became popular then. People exploited the boom by buying homes and selling them only months later at a huge profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That boom ended disastrously. Soaring valuations collapsed with a 35 percent drop in real prices for existing homes, ushering in the financial crisis that enveloped the world in 2008 and 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second greatest boom, from 1942 to 1947, had more benign consequences. Over this five-year interval, real prices of existing homes rose 60 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Booms and busts are rooted in popular narratives with complex social-psychological roots. This boom centered on a war-induced housing shortage, an enormous increase in the number of new babies and families who would need housing after the war, and the 1944 G.I. Bill, which subsidized home-buying by veterans. Home prices did not fall significantly after this boom ended.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, signs of weakness in the housing market are being taken by some as a signal that the prices of single-family homes may fall soon, as they did sharply after 2006. The leading indicators, which include building permits and sales of both existing and new homes, have all been declining in recent months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with few examples of extreme booms, we cannot be sure what such indicators mean for the current market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low interest rates -- imposed by the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> and other central banks in reaction to the financial crisis -- are the most popular culprit in the current boom. There is some apparent merit to this view, since these three biggest nationwide housing booms all included very low interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the market reaction to interest rates is hardly immediate or predictable. The housing market does not react as directly as you might expect to interest rate movements. Over the nearly seven years of the current boom, from February 2012 to the present, all major domestic interest rates have increased, not decreased. So, while interest rates have been low, they have moved the wrong way, yet the boom has continued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another explanation is simple economic growth. But, as a matter of history, prices of existing homes -- as opposed to the supply of newly built homes -- have generally not responded to economic growth. There was only a 20 percent increase in real prices of existing homes in the 50 years from 1950 to 2000 despite a sixfold increase in real G.D.P.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The simplest narrative being given for the current boom is just that the 2008-2009 financial crisis and the so-called Great Recession are over and home prices are returning to normal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that explanation does not cut it either. In September they were 11 percent higher than at the 2006 peak in nominal terms, and almost as high in real terms. This is not a return to normal, but a market that appears to be rising to a record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is difficult to assess the contribution of President Trump to the current boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is certainly less obvious than the role of President George W. Bush in the 1997-2006 boom. Mr. Bush extolled the benefits of ''the ownership society'' and in 2003 he signed the American Dream Downpayment Act, which subsidized home purchases. In his 2004 re-election bid he boldly asserted: ''We want more people owning their own home.'' This seems to have contributed to an atmosphere of high expectations for home price increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Trump administration's attitude toward housing is less clear. President Trump's slogan ''Make America Great Again'' has overtones of the ''American dream.'' But provisions of his Tax Reform and Jobs Act of 2017 were unfriendly to homeowners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even without major further interest rate increases, there would seem to be a limit on how much the prices of existing homes can increase. After all, people must struggle to cover a range of living expenses, and builders are supplying fresh new offerings to compete with the existing houses on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the home price increases are now a self-fulfilling prophesy. As John Maynard Keynes argued in his 1936 ''General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money,'' people seem to have a ''simple faith in the conventional basis of valuation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the conventional basis is now that home prices are going up 5 percent a year, then sellers, who would otherwise have no idea what to ask for their houses, will just put a price based on this convention. And likewise buyers will not feel they are paying too much if they accept the convention. In the United States, we may believe that the process is all part of the ''American dream.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It can't go on forever, of course. But when it will end isn't knowable. The data can't tell us when prices will level off, or whether they will plunge catastrophically. All we do know is that prices have been roaring higher at a speed rarely seen in American history.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Do I rent or do I buy? It's an eternal question, one that can't be solved with economics alone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is particularly fraught time to make such a seemingly monumental decision. Interest rates are rising, which means mortgage payments are going up as well. Lock in those rates now or face the prospect of their going back to, well, normal levels (over 6 percent, from today's 4.5 percent).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stock market, except for a few small corrections, has continued to soar. What that means depends on your outlook: It may be a good time to pull some money out of equity investments and put it into a more stable (and usable) asset like a home, or it may not be the right time, since stocks could continue to rise, increasing your wealth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unemployment is near historic lows, so people's finances may look as good as they have in a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But layer over all of this the current political environment and the fears -- which have persisted for years -- that an economic correction must be around the corner, and making what should be a straightforward financial decision becomes tougher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what do you do? The only thing you can. Draw up a list of pros and cons, just as real estate agents often suggest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reasons to Buy</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOW LONG WILL YOU STAY? If it's one or two years, then rent. The costs to buy and sell the house -- like that pesky 5 percent to 6 percent brokers' commission -- will make it hard for you not to lose money, Chris Herbert, managing director of Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies, pointed out. But if it's more than five to seven years, buy. Even if the housing market falls in value, your home is likely to rebound, at least to the price you paid, by the time you're ready to sell. And you get to live there and accrue equity from paying down the mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ARE YOU SETTLED? If you have small children who want outdoor space to play -- or you're tired of bundling them up and taking them to the playground when you really just want to read the paper -- a house with a yard probably looks appealing. You're settled and are likely to be in the same place for a while, dream as you might for that carefree city life of your single days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WEIGH THE COSTS Homeownership is more cost-effective than renting. Rent rises with inflation. You can potentially lock in your mortgage payment for the next 30 years. While rates rise, you have nothing to worry about. But if they drop below what you're paying, you can refinance and pay less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">YOU HAVE FREEDOM You can do what you want with your home. ''You get to paint the walls the color you want,'' said Christopher J. Mayer, co-director of the Paul Milstein Center for Real Estate at <span class="companylink">Columbia Business School</span>. ''You get to have the funky granite countertop that no one else but you likes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reasons to Rent</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">YOU'RE FREE You have no children, no responsibilities to anyone but yourself (or perhaps a partner or spouse), and no real ties to where you're living and working. Rent away. It's almost a classic example of what economists call sunk costs, -- the home -- versus opportunity costs, which is the ability to move when and if you want, albeit at the price of uncertain rent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOME PRICES ARE RISING The supply of housing is low and house values are appreciating quickly. Renting is cheaper in this scenario because of what real estate economists call the price-to-rent ratio. Consider the San Francisco area, where tiny houses can cost big money. Professor Mayer warns that people who plan to stay in a place like the Bay Area may find themselves continually priced out of the housing market. ''In San Francisco, home prices have been going up faster than other cities for 60 years,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HEED THE WARNINGS The housing market is due for a correction, so now may be the time to wait. ''There are a lot of reasons why there might be some red lights flashing on the dashboard,'' Mr. Herbert said. ''We're coming off a period of very strong growth where house prices are beating inflation. What's enabled them to grow faster is this longer trend putting downward pressure on interest rates.'' With a bit of inflation, the cooling could surely start. so timing the real estate market in the short term is just as difficult as timing any other market</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REALITY CHECK You don't have the down payment for a home or a steady job to pay the mortgage. Your decision is made for you.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These should be happy times for the housing sector. The economy is booming, with more people working at higher pay, and with the sizable millennial generation reaching prime home buying age.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, the housing market has gone soft, acting as a drag on the overall economy rather than as a force propelling it forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new single-family homes were down 22 percent in September from their recent high in November 2017, and existing home sales in September were down 10 percent. This tepid residential investment subtracted from G.D.P. growth in each of the first three quarters of 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices have not declined nationally, at least according to the most widely followed indexes. But their rate of increase has declined, and more and more home sellers are finding they must reduce asking prices to find a buyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given how central housing is to the broader economy -- it is the biggest driver of both wealth and indebtedness for most families, and its fluctuations have frequently been major factors in past booms and busts -- this slump isn't something to be taken lightly for anyone hoping the good times will last.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what's going on?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When you look closely at the data, it appears this paradox of a strong economy and a weak housing market is, at its core, an illustration of a fundamental rule in economics: If something can't go on forever, it won't.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in a given location are ultimately tethered to the incomes of the people who either live there or want to. But for much of the last six years, that relationship has come undone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, personal income per capita has risen 25 percent since the end of 2011, while the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller national home price index is up 48 percent (neither figure is adjusted for inflation).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gap is even larger in the big coastal cities with high wages and booming job markets, but where legal and other barriers make it hard for builders to add to the supply of homes. In the San Francisco metro area, per capita personal income rose 40 percent from 2011 to 2017, while home prices rose 96 percent. Similar patterns are evident in Los Angeles, Seattle, Boston, New York and Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In less high-flying markets, there was still a disconnect. In the Minneapolis area, for example, incomes rose 22 percent while home prices rose 46 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those rising home prices got help from years of very low mortgage rates, which put more expensive homes within reach for people at a given income level. Activity was also probably boosted by some bounce-back effect after the housing market crash of 2007-09, a result of pent-up demand for homes that were not bought while the market was collapsing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rates bottomed out in late 2012 at 3.31 percent for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. They have been moving upward in fits and starts since, including a full percentage point in the last year alone to nearly 5 percent -- still low by historical standards, but high compared with the ultralow levels that had enabled these huge price gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's no doubt that demographics are favorable for housing demand. The peak birth year for millennials was 1990; it's a group that is turning 28 this year and thus entering prime years for home buying. As it happens, 28 is exactly the median response in a <span class="companylink">Bankrate</span> survey that asked adults for the ideal age to buy a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that doesn't matter if prices are out of reach relative to incomes. Moreover, lending standards have remained more rigorous than they were during the last housing boom, so it has been harder for people to stretch to buy a home. The inability of people to buy homes they can't really afford is great news in terms of avoiding another crisis, but not so great for the near-term outlook for housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Buyers can only stomach so many price increases until it gets unsustainable,'' said Daryl Fairweather, the chief economist at the online brokerage Redfin. ''Prices reached a breaking point where buyers were fed up and started to consider other options,'' she said, including renting and moving away from the expensive coastal markets where prices are most out of whack with incomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Economics 101 teaches, price movements are the way that supply and demand match up with each other. But in the housing sector especially, that adjustment can take a while.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In contrast with the stock market, where relatively unemotional traders are buying and selling shares every day and the market stays liquid, home purchase and sales decisions can take months and are deeply emotional for the participants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What seems to be happening is that sellers are trying to cling to the spring 2018 prices that their neighbors received, while there aren't enough buyers in late 2018 willing or able to pay those prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> survey of home purchase sentiment, the proportion of people who think it is a good time to buy a home has decreased significantly since the spring, to a net 21 percent from 29 percent. But so has the proportion who think it is a good time to sell, which has dropped to 35 percent from 45 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You would expect, in a zero-sum transaction like a home sale, for those numbers to move in opposite directions. Instead, it seems that sellers are unhappily realizing that they aren't going to get what they thought their house was worth six months ago, and buyers still think homes are too expensive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That helps explain why transaction volume, especially for new houses, has fallen substantially while prices haven't (at least yet). It's a standoff. And the outcome of the standoff will, in the aggregate, play a role in shaping the future of the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is precedent for this, and it isn't a happy one. In the last housing boom, new home sales peaked in July 2005, and home prices didn't start declining until May 2006. It didn't start to hurt the overall economy until December 2007, when the damage had spread through an overleveraged global financial system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that doesn't mean this episode has to end in tears. Home prices are not nearly as out of line with incomes as they were then; speculative activity hasn't been nearly as frothy; and consumer debt levels are considerably more measured.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think income growth will help us get out of this period,'' said Robert Dietz, the chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders. ''We're probably looking at a period where existing home sales volume is flat to declining, and it now looks like 2017 was the peak year for transaction volume.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A strong (nonhousing) economy makes it more likely that this housing slump will end without a steep 2008-style downturn. So does the basic reality that young adults are forming families and need a place to house them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the meantime, it could be a soft few months or even years of standoffs between buyers and sellers, with the big question of which comes first: sellers who settle for less after recognizing that the price they thought they would get is beyond the reach of buyers, or incomes that catch up with a housing market that got a little ahead of itself.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not too long after Tom Porth sold his business this year, he went to Colorado for a ski vacation. He had worked in different capacities for the Village Inn restaurant chain for four decades, ultimately owning nine restaurants, and he was eager for retirement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a trip to Steamboat Springs, Colo., Mr. Porth returned to his home in Waterloo, Iowa, intent on buying a mountainside condominium. So he did what anyone would do: He found a realtor in Steamboat who arranged for him to rent a condo in the place he thought he’d like.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The price was more than what my Iowa blood was used to seeing, but it seemed to be what you’d pay for something of that caliber,” said Mr. Porth, 62.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But on that visit, his agent suggested a newer, amenity-filled development up the hill — One Steamboat Place. It offered select people the opportunity to stay in a condo before buying it. Those condos cost even more, so he picked the least expensive unit. Still, it was double what the other one cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a real estate market that has been strong, fueled by stock market gains and low interest rates, such programs would seem unnecessary. If one person doesn’t want the condo another will. But a combination of changes to the tax code, which limit the deductions for mortgage interest and property taxes, rising interest rates and a general feeling that increases in home prices are set to cool are making some people anxious about the luxury real estate market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’re a long way into the cycle,” said Christopher Mayer, co-director of the Paul Milstein Center for Real Estate at <span class="companylink">Columbia Business School</span>. “It’s not surprising to see things slow down relative to where they were.” This sense of uncertainty is causing some buyers, particularly at the high end, to be more discerning. Expensive real estate is staying on the market longer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In markets where there is plenty of inventory, buyers are not afraid to take their time, do their research and ensure they feel they are making a good decision,” said Stephanie Anton, president of the Luxury Portfolio International, a luxury real estate firm. “People are not going to overpay or make an emotional decision.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sensing this, some high-end developers have begun building their marketing plans around a concept meant to get people past that uncertainty: test live in a house or condo before you buy it. And this concept is spreading not just in the second home market but to urban condominium developers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If you look at the real estate markets, it’s unbelievable that people tour homes five, six times and make a $10-million investment, but they’ve never stayed there,” said Greg Spencer, the chief executive officer for Timbers Resorts, which developed One Steamboat Place[https://www.onesteamboatplace.com/], where Mr. Porth stayed for his tryout. “We say, if we have available inventory, why not give people the opportunity to try it out?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dan Scott, president and general manager of The Whitetail Club[http://whitetailclub.com/], a development in McCall, Idaho, said the movement toward “try before you buy” is an outgrowth of the housing crash and recession 10 years ago, which left many buyers skittish about making a big investment too quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In the old days you did a real estate tour and drove people around for a few hours, but it didn’t give people a sense of what it was like to be there,” Mr. Scott said. “Coming out of the recession, what the buyer wanted has changed.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Porth said the tryout got him hooked — and more comfortable with spending a lot more money than he’d planned. “I don’t think I’d do it any other way now,” he said. “I need to spend time in that resort but also that unit. By staying, you can learn to love something; you can also learn something you may not like.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After staying in the lowest priced condo, which was about $2 million, he realized he didn’t want to buy that one — it overlooked the parking lot, not the slopes. But by that point he’d been taken in by the amenities and location so he asked to try one on the fifth floor — which cost 20 percent more than the already pricey base unit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April, he closed. Mr. Porth would not disclose the exact price of his home, but the average cost of a condominium in the development is $3 million to $3.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some ways the hook would seem to be the home, but the real selling point is the experience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers can sometimes get away with less than a full home. Clear Creek Tahoe[https://clearcreektahoe.com/] is a mountain community on the Nevada side of Lake Tahoe with golf, water sports, skiing and hiking. It is also right next to California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The marketing of the development started before the real estate crash and essentially went into hibernation until a new group took over in 2015. With the majority of the infrastructure built — but none of the homes — they needed a way to start selling half-acre to five-acre plots that were priced from $300,000 to $1.7 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So they built cottages with the same high-end finishes the eventual homes would have, but designed each one to evoke why people should buy there. One reflected the style of the designers of the golf course, another the boating on Lake Tahoe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lori Brooks and her husband, David, who live in San Diego, had been looking for a home around the lake because it ticked many of the boxes they wanted in what would eventually be a retirement home: near a college town and airport, good health care, plenty of outdoor activities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the spring, on their second visit to the Tahoe area, they stayed in one of the Clear Creek cottages — no charge — and ended up buying a lot. They’re planning on constructing a 4,500-square-foot home with both mountain and golf course views.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We walked to our lot every night,” she said. “We envisioned what we were going to do.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others at the highest end are selling the escape from an uncertain world. Las Ventanas al Paraiso has been a successful resort in San Jose del Cabo, Mexico, for 20 years. It is now marketing the final 30 homes in the property, which range from $2.7 million to over $7 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The question in the beginning was how do we sell them?” said Frederic Vidal, the managing director of the property who joined four years ago to run the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike other program managers, he knew he couldn’t offer a free stay to look at a home. A lot of people knew the resort and he was concerned there would be guests simply looking for a free luxury stay for a few days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So while he decided to charge for the stay, there was a caveat: the money would be refundable if the guest bought a house. The costs per night are $3,000 to $11,000 depending on the size of the home, and only those who are deemed serious buyers are eligible to stay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The try before you buy system works with resorts because people are buying experiences as much or more than a place to sleep and eat. But buying your permanent residence is a bit different: it’s a practical purchase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Letting your children try out bedrooms and play in the yard, while you test out the morning commute and figure out where you’d put the television would yield a lot of valuable information. Chances are, however, there is a family living in the house who would object — or other buyers who would be traipsing through at dinnertime.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few apartment buildings are trying out a service that allows them to turn units they’re waiting to lease — without flooding the market with too much inventory — into temporary hotel rooms, and it has yielded people interested in living there full time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jason Fudin, co-founder and chief executive of WhyHotel, which creates these pop-up hotels, said the setup provides interim cash flow for the developers but also made a new building more attractive for people looking to move in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In a 300-unit building everything is designed for full occupancy,” Mr. Fudin said. “When you’re all alone in a big building something is off. It’s not like being in “Home Alone” — you’re in a zombie building.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At their first project last year, The Bartlett in Arlington, Va., Mr. Fudin found that every 1,000 room stays yielded a tenant for the building, although there are limitations. He said the tryout concept worked better for rental apartments. “A condo is like a car — it has a never-lived-in premium,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some experts say the try before you buy concept is perfect for a risky time — it allows potential homeowners the chance to be sure that they’re making the right choice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While buying a house may be about your personality, Ms. Anton of Luxury Portfolio International said, “It’s also a financial decision.” In uncertain times, it may be best to wade carefully into that kind of big choice.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One Dead, Many Baffled</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Readers responded at nytimes.com to Zoe Greenberg's article last Sunday about Lyric McHenry, a golden child of Hollywood who came to a sordid end in the Bronx. Comments have been edited for length and clarity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. McHenry sounds like a sweet, talented young woman who just dabbled in drugs -- like the majority of young people over the age of 18. And then got in deeper than she expected, and then died by accident. I normally don't support the efforts to criminalize drug usage because alcohol, right? Drugs are not victimless. We have far fewer deaths from alcohol poisoning than from drugs. If drugs were harder to find, or more expensive, Ms. McHenry might not have been able to obtain whatever she died from. Her family, friends, and the rest of us lost a shining light from a mistake. What is it that makes a sweet girl, having the time of her life, still need to get ''high'' in a way that can kill you instantly? We have to figure this out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kathleen, Austin</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There but for the grace of God go I. My condolences to Ms. McHenry's family and friends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Emily J Hancock, Geneva, Ill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For me, Lyric's story above all else stresses how complex lives can be. On the one hand, she was a scholar, artist and popular. On the other hand, she ''partied'' with hard drugs. I can understand why her death is confounding to her family: Someone with privilege like hers is not supposed to die in the fashion she did. But I was not in as much disbelief. The risk inherent in drug use affects rich and poor alike.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LDT, Brooklyn</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More people die from (opiate) addiction than car crashes in the United States. Privileged or talented or desperate or a rising star, it's all the same to the brain of an addict. ''Partying'' used to mean out of control on weekends; now it's an accepted lifestyle. Meanwhile, the dependence on alcohol or other drugs has hijacked the person's life, and effective intervention is required to survive.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing the Homeless Is a Heavy Lift</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Readers also responded to Ginia Bellafante's column last Sunday about an activist confronting Mayor Bill de Blasio at his gym over his homeless policies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing the homeless in hotels or really, homeless mega-shelters is a train wreck for any community -- mostly the homeless community. Many of the homeless suffer from addiction, and lumping addicts together ensures homelessness, and their addictions continue to thrive. It is the utopian setting for both drug addicts and drug pushers. Get a real solution, because hotel mega shelters will never be it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York MEG, Chelsea</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bring back Abe Beame! Exhume John Lindsay! Being mayor of New York is an impossible job. De Blasio is a regular Joe trying to do his best. The demands and expectations are unrealistic. Homeless issues plague all big cities including New York, Moscow or San Francisco. More housing is necessary for all types to set the supply and demand equation right. The etiology of homelessness has many factors; free housing is not the answer. When job skills are scarce the family structure breaks down, the city is expected to jump in. Churches, temples and labor unions should be required to provide some temporary housing as part of their tax-free status. Mental illness is another cause of homelessness and needs to be addressed. Making a show of public confrontation against politicians does little to solve the issues, but does alienate voters, whether it is on local or on national issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">cdb, California</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One problem that needs to be addressed is how some ''affordable'' housing, is really not affordable for most. This type of housing should be called ''somewhat affordable'' or ''almost affordable housing.'' When developers build units and promise to provide some affordable housing in order to build bigger and wider, they should be made to build the affordable housing before they build the luxury housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is I, Brooklyn</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until there is a recognized ''human right'' to adequate living space, education, health care, clothing and a law limiting market rents and real estate accumulation, there will always be homelessness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OhPlease</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This ambush engagement of politicians is a current fad brought on by the seeming success in confronting a certain Republican senator in an elevator during the recent Supreme Court nomination process. It is not new -- think back to Michael Moore or Sacha Baron Cohen or ''60 Minutes'' in its heyday. Gonzo politics. I am not sure I like it because of where it could go next.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ben, Austin</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No, the confrontation is brought on by those fed up with being ignored, disbelieved and disrespected by those who put party above honor, ethics and indecency. Flake is a coward and the women who confronted him are heroes. If you want to see ''gonzo'' politics, tune in to a Trump propaganda rally where instead of promoting unity and patriotism, he blabbers on and on about perceived personal slights, attacks those who disagree with him and carries on like a deranged nut case. ''Ambush'' or ''speaking truth to power'' as it's really known is just the beginning until we bring balance and normalcy back to our government. Get over it or get out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LisaG, South Florida</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For some reason I feel there are those who will never be proud for Mayor Bill de Blasio no matter what he does to help the homeless. In cases such as this, it will always seem like a lose-lose for him. I say this because if he doesn't do much, his critics will rule him for being apathetic. Meanwhile, even if he does try to help solve the homeless crisis, his critics will claim he isn't doing enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, there will always be a group that will keep raising the bar and grilling him no matter what he does. Perhaps, he isn't the one with the ego, but certain people are, and they use him as their personal scapegoat. It's not as if any of you who criticize him have any solutions yourselves for this problem. Personally, we should blame both former Mayors Rudy Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg for their huge push for gentrification that created the very problem to start with in which de Blasio is forced to handle. Maybe the reason he goes to this particular gym is because it's the one he is been going for decades just like anyone else who goes to theirs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are times to bother him; there are times when it shouldn't be done. Even politicians need to have times for privacy. Another thing is that I don't think those pressuring him are really critics but rather bullies who are constantly picking on him for just about everything he does.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tal Barzilai, Pleasantville, N.Y.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brooklyn Heights Fights Robert Moses Again</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A reader responded by letter to Ms. Bellafante's Oct. 7 column about the city's development-obsessed approach to urban planning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Bellafante presents a false choice in suggesting that the city can either fix crumbling infrastructure or build a swimming pool. Indisputably, the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway must be fixed. However, the suggestion that real estate interests drove the city to build a park at the expense of initiating this crucial and complex rehabilitation project is fiction. Community activists fought to build the park. And the community, as well as elected and government officials, admirably pushed forward rather than endure an indefinite B.Q.E. waiting period, which likely would have led to the death of the entire park project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The assertion that the pool is ''hardly necessary in a wealthy neighborhood'' also misses the point. Brooklyn Bridge Park is more than a neighborhood park, attracting visitors from every corner of the city, precisely because it provides public amenities that are not available elsewhere, like the exceptionally maintained and well-loved basketball courts at Pier 2.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another claim: The park was built with ''land-usurping parking spaces.'' The two garages within the park are underneath buildings. The small parking lot at Pier 2 sits atop <span class="companylink">Con Edison</span> vaults and other utilities infrastructure, which is also not viable parkland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Restoring the B.Q.E. is imperative, but the way this column links the project to Brooklyn Bridge Park is misleading and divisive.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DENVER -- By nearly any measure, this city is booming. The unemployment rate is below 3 percent. There is so much construction that a local newspaper started a ''crane watch'' feature. Seemingly every week brings headlines about companies bringing high-paying jobs to the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, Denver's once-soaring housing market has run into turbulence. Sales and construction activity have slowed in recent months. Houses that would once have drawn a frenzy of offers are sitting on the market for days or weeks. Selling prices are rising more slowly, and asking prices are being slashed to attract buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similar slowdowns have hit New York, Seattle and even San Francisco, cities that until recently ranked among the nation's hottest housing markets. The specifics vary, but economists, real estate agents and home builders say the core issue is the same: Home buyers are reaching a breaking point after years of breakneck price increases that far exceeded income gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The local economy is still fantastic, all the fundamentals are there, but obviously wages are not keeping pace,'' said Steve Danyliw, a Denver realtor. ''As the market continues to move up, buyers are being pushed out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rachel Sandoval is one of them. An elementary schoolteacher in the Denver Public Schools, Ms. Sandoval earns about $50,000 a year, enough to afford a condominium or a modest house in most markets. But not in Denver, where the median sales price for all homes was $410,000 in August, and where even condos routinely top $300,000 -- a price Ms. Sandoval calls ''not even close to feasible.'' She said she was scoping out jobs in Texas, where houses are cheaper and pay is higher, and considering leaving teaching in search of a higher salary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, Ms. Sandoval, 41, is sharing a one-bathroom rental house with two roommates, a nurse and an adjunct professor. The three stick to a strict schedule to make sure they can all get to work on time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are professionals, we have degrees,'' Ms. Sandoval said. ''This was not the plan.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, sales of previously owned homes fell 1.5 percent in August from a year earlier, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>. Residential building permits were down 5.5 percent over the past year, according to the Department of Commerce. Many economists say the housing market may have turned into a drag on the gross domestic product.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent slowdown, however, is unlikely to give would-be buyers like Ms. Sandoval much relief. Prices in Denver are still up 8 percent over the past year, according to the S&amp;P Case-Shiller index. That's cool compared to the double-digit gains of a couple years ago, but well ahead of the 6 percent increase in average hourly earnings over the same period. Rising interest rates have also made buying homes more expensive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few analysts expect an outright decline in home prices anytime soon. That's because, unlike the speculative bubble of the mid-2000s, the recent run-up in prices has been driven primarily by economic fundamentals: People are moving to Denver faster than developers can build places to live. The Denver region has added more than 300,000 residents since 2010, making it one of the country's fastest-growing areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Introductory economics textbooks suggest that high prices should attract more supply or suppress demand -- or both. Inventories of unsold homes have risen in Denver and other markets in recent months, and the real estate site Zillow found that price cuts have become more common.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, however, the housing market is not behaving as the textbooks say it should. Inventories remain low despite the recent increases, and new construction is slowing, not picking up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the problem, local real estate agents say, is that the furious pace of price growth has essentially gummed up the market, making homeowners reluctant to sell for fear of being unable to find a new home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising interest rates are compounding the problem because would-be sellers do not want to give up their low interest rates, a phenomenon economists call the lock-in effect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brant and Annie Wiedel spent more than a year trying to get a foothold in Denver's housing market -- and they are reluctant to give it up. The couple estimate that they looked at 160 houses before finally closing on a three-bedroom ranch house in Lakewood, a suburb, three years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With two children and a third due in January, the Wiedels would like to trade up. With the rise in home prices some renovations, the house they bought for $350,000 could be worth more than $500,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the family borrowed at about 3.5 percent three years ago. Today, they would pay closer to 5 percent. ''Even if we just saw houses at the same price, we'd have to pay more'' every month, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultimately, the key to breaking the logjam is to build more homes. Downtown Denver is crawling with cranes, many of them erecting amenity-filled apartment complexes aimed at young professionals. A drive in almost any direction from downtown reveals freshly built subdivisions with names like Tallgrass, The Enclave and Green Gables Reserve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of those new homes, however, will list for more than $400,000. And hardly any builders are selling properties for under $300,000 without government subsidies. Even many home builders worry they are pricing themselves out of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I see the biggest threat to our business as the affordability challenge, that we are building houses that people can't afford,'' said Gene Myers, chief executive of Thrive Home Builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem, Mr. Myers and other local builders say, is cost. The price of land, building permits and other fees can run close to $150,000 for a single-family lot -- before construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the challenges are specific to Colorado. Quirks in state law, for example, make it easy for condominium buyers to collectively sue builders over construction defects, making developers reluctant to build condos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But other issues are common to many cities. Building materials have become more expensive, in part because of tariffs on lumber and other products that President Trump imposed this year. Labor costs are rising, too, especially for skilled trade workers. Restrictive zoning makes it hard to build denser developments that make cheaper homes profitable for builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They're producing what they can produce,'' said Sam Khater, chief economist for Freddie Mac, the government housing-finance company. ''The problem is, it's uneconomic for them to produce affordable.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This big-city conundrum is spreading. People priced out of San Francisco moved to Seattle and Portland, driving up prices and displacing people who moved to Denver and Austin. Next on the list: Boise, Nashville and other cities offering some of the same attractions at lower prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sure enough, the online real estate site Redfin this spring found that Denver had joined Seattle and San Francisco as cities with a ''net outflow'' of users -- that is, there were more people on the site looking to leave Denver than to move there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''City after city is going to face this,'' said Glenn Kelman, Redfin's chief executive. ''At some point, the buyers step back and say, 'Enough is enough.'''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More people are moving to Denver than leaving it, but migration has tapered off in recent years. J. J. Ament, chief executive of Metro Denver Economic Development Corporation, said he had seen no sign that rising home prices were making the region less attractive. Last month, <span class="companylink">VF Corporation</span>, an apparel maker that owns brands like The North Face and Vans, announced it would move its headquarters to Denver from North Carolina, partly because of the area's reputation for outdoor activities. The state also offered $27 million in incentives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I wouldn't use the word 'crisis,''' Mr. Ament said. ''The work force is still willing to move here.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plenty of people in Denver do use the word ''crisis,'' however. A January report from Shift Research Lab, a local research group, concluded that years of under-building have left the region with a shortfall of tens of thousands of housing units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That shortfall could threaten Denver's growth, said Phyllis Resnick, a Colorado State University economist and one of the report's authors. The skilled workers moving to the area, who have been so important to attracting companies and jobs, want to be able to eat out at restaurants, drop off their dry cleaning and send their children to school, all of which require lower and middle income workers. If they cannot afford to live in the area, Ms. Resnick said, Denver will not retain its allure -- and the economy will not keep growing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My concern is, at some point it sort of breaks because we can't house the folks that we need to fill out all the economic activity in the region,'' she said. ''I'm not convinced that in the near term it will correct itself just through market forces, unless that's through people moving out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local governments and charities are trying to address the problem. The Denver City Council last month voted to double, to $30 million per year, the city's affordable housing fund, which is used to build and preserve homes for low-income residents. Late last year, nonprofit groups announced they had raised $24 million to start the Elevation Community Land Trust, which will buy land to create permanently affordable housing. Another new program aims to help public schoolteachers come up with down payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To have a big impact, economists say Denver and other cities have to build more homes affordable to middle-class families. That will require persuading communities accustomed to single-family homes to accept condos and townhomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The only way to solve the riddle is through density,'' said Dave Lemnah, co-owner of Lokal Homes, a Denver builder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's why he is building projects like the Villas at Wheatlands, a 94-unit development in Aurora, east of Denver. Each lot has three attached units arranged like a jigsaw puzzle. Lokal sells the homes for less than $400,000; some go for close to $300,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One buyer, Angela Kirkland-Vandecar, an aesthetician and a single mother, has spent two years searching for a home she could afford on her roughly $50,000 income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Ms. Kirkland-Vandecar began her search, she did not want to move to Aurora or to a condo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've now done everything that in the beginning I said I was not going to do,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ms. Kirkland-Vandecar feels good about her decision. Her monthly mortgage payment will be less than her $1,900 monthly rent, and she is happy not to have a lawn to mow. Her daughters, 11 and 13, will have their own rooms, and she will no longer have to store food in the laundry room, as she did in the cramped apartment she had been renting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Walking through her nearly ready house recently, looking for defects, Ms. Kirkland-Vandecar opened a door in the kitchen and paused. A Lokal Homes worker asked if she had found a problem. She shook her head.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm just enjoying my pantry,'' she said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DENVER — By nearly any measure, this city is booming. The unemployment rate is below 3 percent. There is so much construction that a local newspaper started a “crane watch” feature. Seemingly every week brings headlines about companies bringing high-paying jobs to the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, Denver’s once-soaring housing market has run into turbulence. Sales and construction activity have slowed in recent months. Houses that would once have drawn a frenzy of offers are sitting on the market for days or weeks. Selling prices are rising more slowly, and asking prices are being slashed to attract buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similar slowdowns have hit New York, Seattle and even San Francisco, cities that until recently ranked among the nation’s hottest housing markets. The specifics vary, but economists, real estate agents and home builders say the core issue is the same: Home buyers are reaching a breaking point after years of breakneck price increases that far exceeded income gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The local economy is still fantastic, all the fundamentals are there, but obviously wages are not keeping pace,” said Steve Danyliw, a Denver realtor. “As the market continues to move up, buyers are being pushed out.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rachel Sandoval is one of them. An elementary schoolteacher in the Denver Public Schools, Ms. Sandoval earns about $50,000 a year, enough to afford a condominium or a modest house in most markets.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">__________</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A mania appears to have gripped cannabis stocks. <span class="companylink">Tilray</span>, a Canadian maker of cannabis products, surged as much as 94 percent Wednesday, gave it all back and then rallied again in the final 18 minutes to close up nearly 40 percent. Along the way, trading in the stock was halted four times. The company went public in July at $17 a share and has soared nearly 1,160 percent to close Wednesday at $214.06. <span class="companylink">Tilray</span> is now valued at $20 billion, making it roughly the same size as <span class="companylink">American Airlines</span>, <span class="companylink">CBS</span> and Hershey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Amazon effect strikes specialty retailers. <span class="companylink">Amazon</span>, according to CNBC, is testing out a new service, called Scout, that is designed to make it easier for consumers to browse by asking them to give a thumbs up or a thumbs down to products and then showing other products based on their choices. News of the service hit the stocks of specialty retailers. Shares of Stitch Fix were down 6 percent on Wednesday, while Wayfair and <span class="companylink">Etsy</span> were off nearly 3 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Companies have been stockpiling ahead of the latest round of tariffs on Chinese goods. Imports of more than 80 percent of the product lines covered by the tariffs increased from May through July, and imports of over a quarter of those product lines jumped by more than 25 percent, according to S7P Global's Panjiva, a supply chain data firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forget the ''Fed Put.'' The market now has a ''Trump Tariff Put.'' One of the most persistent questions over the past several months: Why haven't stocks on Wall Street sold off more on the escalating trade war between the United States and China? Nicholas Colas, a co-founder of DataTrek Research, offered an explanation. ''President Trump measures his administration's success in part by how the S. &amp; P. 500 and Dow perform,'' Mr. Colas wrote. ''If market fears of a real and lasting trade war were to sharply hit United States stocks, he would moderate his position quickly.'' That sounds an awful lot like the so-called Fed Put, which is essentially the idea that the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> will come to the rescue of investors by lowering rates whenever stocks tumble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts in the United States rose in August. The United States housing market could use some upbeat news after months of weakness. The headline number from the Commerce Department's report on housing starts on Wednesday looked like it. But a deeper look suggests that the 9.2 percent jump in housing starts last month is likely not sustainable. The increase was driven by a 29.3 percent rise in multifamily buildings, a segment that tends to be volatile. Building permits, a good gauge of future activity, fell to their lowest level in more than a year. Thursday will bring further clarity on the health of housing. The <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> will release its report on sales of existing homes, which account for about 90 percent of home sales in the United States. Economists expect sales to tick up after four months of declines.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TRANSPORTATION</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hydrogen-powered trains begin service in Germany.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a breakthrough for a green fuel, two hydrogen-powered trains are expected to go into commercial service Monday on a rail line in northern Germany near Hamburg. The trains, which will serve cities including Bremerhaven and Cuxhaven, will be powered by hydrogen fuel cells that generate electricity through a chemical reaction. The trains are being promoted as a cheaper alternative to stringing wires on rail lines that are not electrified. Hydrogen-powered vehicles produce no emissions of carbon dioxide, which is blamed for climate change, or other pollutants. Despite substantial support from Germany and other governments, high costs and other obstacles have so far limited use of the gas as a transportation fuel. The trains were made by <span class="companylink">Alstom</span>, a French company that has received extensive government support for developing them. <span class="companylink">Alstom</span> officials said they plan to eventually have 14 trains on the line in Lower Saxony and that they are in talks with rail operators in other German regions and internationally to sell more trains.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Who will take home the Emmys?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 70th Primetime Emmy Awards will be broadcast on NBC at 8 p.m. on Monday. For once, it's a wide-open year for best drama and comedy. In the drama category, it's a showdown between <span class="companylink">HBO</span>'s "Game of Thrones" and <span class="companylink">Hulu</span>'s "The Handmaid's Tale." In comedy, will it be FX's "Atlanta" or Amazon's "The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel?" One big question looming over the ceremony: Will <span class="companylink">HBO</span> be able to hold off <span class="companylink">Netflix</span> for total Emmy wins? <span class="companylink">HBO</span> has collected the biggest haul of any television network for 16 straight years.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An appraisal of the real estate market will be released.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two reports on the state of the housing market are coming out this week. On Wednesday, at 8:30 a.m., the Commerce Department will release data on housing starts in August. The real estate market has been cooling in some parts of the country, and housing starts were anemic in June and July. Some economists expect to see a rebound for August, but continued weakness would be more evidence of a downward trend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, at 10 a.m., the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> will report on existing home sales in August. Like housing starts, this data point has been weak, falling for four months in a row. With supply limited and interest rates inching up, most experts don't expect a quick rebound.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is part of a series on what is at stake in New York's primary elections on Thursday, and in the general election on Nov. 6.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As gentrification and a bloated real estate market intensify New Yorkers' frantic search for affordable housing, and escalate the threat of homelessness, voters can fight back by electing lawmakers willing to break the real estate industry's grip on Albany.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">State lawmakers flush with the industry's donations have been gutting New York City's rent regulations for decades, putting hundreds of thousands of rent-stabilized apartments on the open market, driving up housing costs and forcing poor and middle-class New Yorkers out of their homes. Restoring those protections and giving New York City power over its own rent regulations could keep more families housed at a price they can afford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York's system of rent regulation, limiting how much landlords can charge tenants, began in the 1940s to help a growing middle class. There are about one million apartments covered under rent-restricting regulations now, about a quarter fewer than there were in the early 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stage was set for this loss in affordable housing in 1971, when the Legislature took control of rent regulation away from New York City by passing the Urstadt Law, which barred the city from enacting rent laws more restrictive than those of the state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the most destructive wave of deregulation began in 1993, when the Legislature, under threats from Senate Republicans to end the rent regulation system altogether, created a compromise that deregulated an apartment when a tenant left after the rent had reached $2,000 per month. That was a high rent at the time, and a column in The Times predicted that the measure would create ''little change'' for tenants. Clearly, that was wrong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That wave became a tsunami when, in 1997, state lawmakers approved rules that allowed landlords to increase the rent by 20 percent when an apartment became vacant. By the following year, the city was losing three times as many rent-regulated apartments as before. The measure has proved to be a powerful incentive for landlords to continually push out tenants until a unit's rent exceeds the state limit and the unit can enter the open market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since landlords can be allowed to raise rents to cover the cost of renovations, many make minor improvements that may not be necessary, or they artificially inflate the cost of improvements, to inflate rents and inch units closer to deregulation. Though the latter is illegal, the state's overtaxed enforcement body is largely incapable of holding landlords accountable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even when rents are down and market conditions ought to benefit tenants, legislators made sure the law worked to the benefit of landlords. Rent guidelines set the rent a landlord can legally charge for an apartment. Sometimes that's higher than its market rate, so landlords charge a lower ''preferential rent.'' Landlords once had to wait for the tenant being charged a preferential rent to move before they could raise the rent to the legal limit. But in 2003, as gentrification was sending real estate values surging across the city, the Legislature passed a law letting landlords raise rents when current tenants renewed their leases, leading to steep, sudden rent hikes for many tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's what happened to Amauri Vasquez, who was paying $700 a month for a rent-stabilized two-bedroom apartment in the Bushwick area of Brooklyn when his landlord raised the rent to $1,025. ''I can't afford that,'' said Vasquez, 36. ''But this is reality. This is what happens every day in Bushwick.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The combined impact of these efforts has been severe: 284,301 New York City apartments were deregulated between 1994 and 2017, according to city data. During the same period, rents soared. Together, these two trends have put enormous financial pressure on poor and middle-class New Yorkers and helped push some 60,000 people into city homeless shelters. As of this month, that figure included more than 22,000 children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even a casual follower of America's corrupt politics would not be surprised that lawmakers who voted to benefit wealthy interests at the expense of their constituents raked in money from those interests. From 2005 to 2013, the New York real estate industry contributed at least $44 million to state candidates, committees and PACs. Such largess was made possible in part by a loophole the state Board of Elections created in 1996 that treats limited liability companies as ''individuals,'' allowing them to donate up to $65,100 a year to any state candidate instead of forcing them to abide by the $5,000 corporate limit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The money grubbing has been bipartisan, but the Republican-controlled State Senate has been the landlords' most reliable friend. So the best chance to strengthen rent laws and protect affordable housing is to deliver the Senate into Democratic hands in November, and elect reformist Democrats in the primary on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, here are some actions lawmakers can take:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overturn the Urstadt Law</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Return control of the rent laws to New York City, where it belongs. The city should be able to decide how it wants to regulate rents without getting approval from the state Legislature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">End High-Rent Vacancy Decontrol</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once an apartment's rent hits $2,733.75, it no longer falls under any rent regulation once the current tenant moves. A fairer system would keep the apartment under rent stabilization and allow for gradual increases that reflect owners' costs and rates set by the city's Rent Guidelines Board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">End Vacancy Bonuses</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Landlords' ability to raise the rent by 20 percent every time an apartment is vacated is a perverse incentive for continually displacing tenants to boost an apartment's rent until it is deregulated. It's no coincidence that tenant harassment is pervasive in New York City. The company owned by the family of Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, for example, has been accused of such misconduct. Lawmakers should scrap this incentive entirely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">End the Preferential Rent Bonus</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Landlords should only be allowed to raise rents to the legal limit after a tenant who had been paying a lower rent moves out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strengthen the Division of Housing and Community Renewal</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the state agency that enforces rent laws, and it needs more funding to bring much-needed accountability to a system that is widely abused by landlords. One way would be for the agency to require landlords to submit receipts for improvements to individual apartments to the agency and the tenant. Rent increases justified by such improvements, as well as capital improvements to the entire building, should be made temporary, lasting only until the costs are paid off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Yorkers' votes on Thursday and on Nov. 6 can craft a Legislature devoted to the needs of city residents, not the demands of their donors. That's how to keep more New Yorkers in their homes.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Tax Cuts Were Going to Tank Housing Prices. They Didn't.</span>
</div><div class="author">By JIM TANKERSLEY </div><div>1678 words</div><div>28 August 2018</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2018 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- It wasn't supposed to take long for the Trump tax cuts to hobble housing prices, particularly in the high-tax, high-cost metro areas where the new law was poised to rip federal incentives to buy new homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly nine months later, those warnings have not materialized. While the nation's housing market is showing signs of weakness on several fronts -- particularly in new-home construction -- prices across the country are continuing to climb. That's true even in the million-dollar-plus markets of California and Washington, D.C., which appeared most at risk for a hit when the bill was pending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists see only faint effects from the new law so far in housing data. They're small, and they're contained to a few high-priced, highly taxed ZIP codes, largely in blue states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They're nothing close to the carnage that real estate groups warned about when the law was under debate last fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We thought that there would be some impact,'' Lawrence Yun, the chief economist for the National Association of Realtors, said this spring, ''but the market is saying, so far, there is not an impact.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other clouds are looming, however, and policymakers are beginning to worry about the health of the housing market nationwide. Minutes from the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> meeting that ended on Aug. 1 cited the risk of a ''significant weakening in the housing sector'' in the months to come. Fed officials noted that residential investment had declined this year, and that the issuance of new building permits had fallen. They reported that residential construction activity appeared ''to have softened somewhat,'' for reasons that could include rising mortgage rates, scarcity of available lots in certain cities and price pressures on homebuilders attributed to rising labor costs and recently imposed tariffs on building materials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But they did not raise similar alarms about falling home values -- or about the impact of the tax cuts on the housing markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Trump tax cuts reduce incentives for homeownership</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because it doubles the size of the standard deduction that most taxpayers take -- and reduces the incentives for Americans to claim itemized deductions -- the new tax law will reduce the number of Americans who claim the mortgage interest deduction on their income taxes. It dilutes the value of the mortgage deduction for some new, high-end buyers by limiting the tax break for interest paid to a mortgage debt of $750,000 or less. The new law also caps at $10,000 the amount of state and local taxes, including property taxes, that homeowners can deduct from their federal taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The direct result of these changes,'' the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> told members of Congress in a letter in November, ''would be a plunge in home values across America in excess of 10 percent, and likely more in higher cost areas.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">See if you can spot that plunge in the data:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median American home sold for nearly 6 percent more in June than it did a year ago, according to data from the online real estate firm Zillow -- the same rate as the increase from June 2016 to June 2017. The strength has continued even though the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> has raised interest rates steadily for the past year, which also dampens prices by pushing up the cost to borrow for home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homebuyers don't seem worried about the new law</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last fall, as the tax overhaul package sped through Congress, Anslie Stokes started fielding questions from nervous home buyers, who were hearing warnings that the bill would crimp the government's incentives for homeownership and upend housing markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Stokes, a Realtor who runs the Stokes Group at McEnearney Associates in the Washington, D.C., area, noticed at the time what she calls a ''pause'' in buyer activity. But soon after Mr. Trump signed the law in December, buying activity picked right back up again in the wealthy neighborhoods of the District of Columbia and the high-end suburbs of Maryland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We haven't seen buyers lower their price point'' as a result of the tax law, Ms. Stokes said. ''All buyers are aware of it, and they're factoring it in. But they're not changing what they want to do.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's true even though the tax law has unquestionably diminished the value of several federal subsidies for homeowners. It limits deductions for state and local taxes, including property taxes, to $10,000 per household, which hurts owners of expensive homes in high-tax states. It lowers the cap on the mortgage interest deduction, which raises housing prices by allowing homeowners to write off the interest payments from their loans, to $750,000 for new loans, down from $1 million. Existing loans are grandfathered under the old cap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The law also dilutes the value of the mortgage deduction by doubling the standard deduction for all taxpayers, to $24,000 for couples and $12,000 for individuals. That increase is expected to reduce dramatically the number of taxpayers who claim itemized deductions. The congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimated earlier this year that about 14 million American tax filers will claim the mortgage deduction this year, for a total value of about $25 billion. That's down from 32 million filers, and a total value of nearly $60 billion, in 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only SALT is dragging on home prices -- and not by much</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The limitation on deductions for state and local tax, or SALT for short, appears to be the only change having much impact on the market, according to a detailed analysis of housing markets across the country from economists at Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The analysis looked at the pace of housing value appreciation in local markets across the country, before and after the new law took effect. It isolated changes in those rates, over time, when controlling for several factors: the share of residents who itemize their deductions, who claim the mortgage deduction, or claim the SALT deduction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first two had no effect on whether home values increased faster or slower in an area after the law took effect. But starting with the date for May, the Zillow team began to see a significant, but small, change based on the use of the state and local tax deduction. In the top 10 percent of areas that make use of the SALT deduction, growth in home values have slowed by about 0.6 percentage points since the law took effect. At the median, growth has slowed by about 0.3 percentage points. The bottom 10 percent haven't seen any slowdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zillow researchers say the Boston metro area illustrates the point. It straddles state lines, with one state (Massachusetts) featuring higher state income taxes that drive more residents to claim the SALT deduction. After the law passed, ZIP codes in the Boston area saw a 0.6 percentage point slowdown in home appreciation on the Massachusetts side -- and a 0.1 percent acceleration on the New Hampshire side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The effect there is ''not huge, it's small,'' said Aaron Terrazas, senior economist at Zillow. Home sellers in areas with high use of the SALT deduction are not, in general, losing money from the law, he said. ''They're giving up hypothetical money that otherwise they would have had.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are, of course, markets across the country where housing prices have actually fallen in the past year. One of them is notably high-priced: New York City. Prices in Manhattan fell 1.1 percent from a year earlier in June, the online real estate firm StreetEasy reports. But economists say tax policy isn't driving the trend -- it's good old fashioned supply and demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In April, May and June, we had a flood of new homes hit the market,'' said Grant Long, a senior economist at StreetEasy. ''It's really hard to say why that is.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the flip side is San Jose, Calif.: Its prices continue to skyrocket, even though Silicon Valley residents are heavy users of the SALT deduction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some benefits from tax reform may be offsetting the drags</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts say several forces are helping to counteract the diminished federal home-buying subsidies. Across the country, a growing economy has finally begun to entice millennials into the buying market, after years of waiting for their finances to recover from recession. Direct savings that workers are realizing from the new law's cuts in individual tax rates could be helping, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike in New York City, the supply of homes on the market -- both newly built, and existing homes put up for sale -- is falling for the nation as a whole, which also lifts prices. That tight supply is partially the result of a decade of caution in the home building industry following the housing crisis. It also stems from strict local curbs on new housing development, particularly in ''hot'' metro areas such as Denver, Los Angeles and Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trump administration officials say the lack of a discernible crimp on housing prices proves the administration's predictions that income gains spurred by the tax cuts could cancel out what the <span class="companylink">White House Council of Economic Advisers</span> predicted would be a ''modest'' impact from lowering the mortgage interest deduction cap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are a whole bunch of people who swallowed the 'tax cuts aren't going to stimulate much' story,'' said Kevin Hassett, the council's director. ''But if you're getting a lot of income growth, the income growth increases the demand for housing, and the mortgage interest deduction reduces it. And the effects offset.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists caution that the changes might have a larger effect in an economy where housing inventory is more plentiful, or where income growth is slower and consumers worry more about tax preferences when making buying decisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A dent on prices ''will show up over time,'' Mr. Yun said. ''But when is that time? Will it take one year? Two years? Three years? That is the question.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Charles Kushner, the developer whose son Jared Kushner is a senior adviser to President Trump, and Michael Cohen, the president's former personal lawyer, face scrutiny in New York for claims that they falsified construction permits in an attempt to remove rent-regulated tenants from buildings scattered across the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, the city's Department of Buildings cited <span class="companylink">Kushner Companies</span> for 42 violations in which it submitted false permit information at 17 buildings, where many of the tenants were protected from steep rent increases and eviction. The fines total $210,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokeswoman for <span class="companylink">Kushner Companies</span> said Monday that the violations were ''paperwork errors.'' The company can contest the citations before an administrative judge. ''In no case did the company act in disregard of the safety of our tenants,'' said the spokeswoman, Christine Taylor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tenant activists also issued a report on Monday based on city and state records that suggested that an investment group led by Mr. Cohen had also falsified construction permits by claiming that three buildings in Manhattan were vacant or without rent-regulated tenants, when they were occupied and many tenants had rental protections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Landlords are required in New York City to disclose whether tenants in their buildings are rent regulated to obtain a construction permit. This requirement is designed to safeguard rent-regulated tenants from harassment. Unscrupulous landlords sometimes push out rent-protected tenants so they can sharply increase rents on those units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics, however, complain that numerous violations slip through the cracks between the separate data systems used by city and state agencies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 172 Rivington Street, for example, the Cohen group indicated that there were no rent-regulated tenants in the 20-unit building, after the company purchased it in October 2011 for $2.1 million. But records indicated that there were 19 protected tenants there, but only 11 remained after the Cohen group sold the building three years later for $10 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tenants living in Mr. Cohen's buildings repeatedly filed complaints about noise and dust related to construction work, according to the report by Housing Rights Initiative, a nonprofit tenant advocacy group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Buildings Department said it had investigated 6 complaints at 172 Rivington Street and observed no violations of city construction rules there, or at a second building controlled by the Cohen group, according to a spokesman, Joseph Soldevere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Cohen group held the buildings for only a few years and then sold them for a combined $17 million profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cohen did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tenant group issued a similar report about the Kushners in the spring after sifting through public records from the Department of Buildings, the Finance Department and the state's Homes and Community Renewal agency, which oversees rent-regulated tenants. Up until 2015, when the city and state agencies formed a Tenant Harassment Task Force, there had been little coordination among them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year, current and former tenants at 184 Kent Avenue in Brooklyn, a Kushner-owned residential building at the edge of the East River, sued the <span class="companylink">Kushner Companies</span> in State Supreme Court claiming that they had been forced out by ''loud and obnoxious drilling'' and a ''constant cloud of toxic smoke and dust.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of rent-regulated tenants in the building plummeted to 71 in June from 316 in May 2015; the <span class="companylink">Kushner Companies</span> are now selling condominium apartments in the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither Mr. Cohen nor the <span class="companylink">Kushner Companies</span> have been cited for tenant harassment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aaron Carr, executive director of Housing Rights Initiative, said that the group's analysis ''suggests that Mr. Cohen had commenced a deliberate campaign to systematically harass tenants out of their apartments using destructive, hazardous and illegal construction practices, so he could dramatically raise rents.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the report also provides a ''window into the dysfunction at city and state agencies,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Department of Buildings approved falsified permits,'' he said, ''despite receiving complaints from tenants in those very same buildings.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Records indicate a steep decrease in the number of rent-regulated tenants in the buildings owned by Mr. Cohen and the Kushners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the city would not know whether some number of tenants were paid cash by the landlord to leave, a common practice used by building owners to empty apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mayor Bill de Blasio has built or preserved tens of thousands of apartments for low- and moderate- and middle-income tenants. Still, his administration has been unable to keep up with the loss of affordable housing as apartments leave the rent-regulation system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cohen purchased 237 Henry Street in the Lower East Side of Manhattan for $3.35 million in August 2013. Construction work in the building commenced almost immediately.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Longtime New Yorkers Joanne and Vince Intrieri left their 3,100-square-foot three-bedroom near the United Nations earlier this year, trading it in for a sunny three-bedroom condominium in Downtown Miami.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Intrieri, who has a construction and design firm that she is moving to Miami, and Mr. Intrieri, who owns VDA Capital Management, were not ready to retire. But they decided to move to the Florida coast to escape exorbitant taxes that they knew would be exacerbated by the Trump administration's new tax law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My husband and I have been in New York City for more than 20 years, but we aren't tied to an office anymore and our kids are older,'' said Ms. Intrieri, 59. ''Between the state and city taxes, plus about $50,000 in property taxes, it is a lot of money going out the door. Why do it?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, as the legislation is known, was passed last year and will be applied to 2018 returns, which are due in April 2019. The law limits the deductions taxpayers can take on property taxes and state and local taxes (known as SALT deductions) up to $10,000 -- a cap that many New Yorkers easily exceed. For the highest earners, New York state's income tax rate is 8.82 percent and New York City's rate is 3.876 percent. Nearly half of Manhattan's taxpayers have taken SALT deductions in the past, and the average deduction has been over $60,000 a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new legislation also limits the deductions that taxpayers can claim on interest for mortgages up to $750,000, down from the previous $1 million limit. Mortgages often surpass this cap in Manhattan, where the average sales price for a co-op or condominium was $2.09 million in the second quarter of this year, according to <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All told, more than 8 percent of New York State residents will face higher taxes for 2018, according to an analysis by the <span class="companylink">Tax Policy Center</span>. For those with income in the top one percent, a much larger number -- 29 percent -- will see their income taxes rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The specter of higher taxes has prompted some New Yorkers, like the Intrieris, to seek relief by moving to lower-tax states, while others have deliberately sought out buildings with tax abatements to reduce their costs. Accountants say that others are exploring different ways to minimize their tax bills, like converting part of a home into a business with a home office or through <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span> for a tax deduction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In anticipation of higher tax bills, the Intrieris and others have already relocated to states like Florida, which has no income tax and low property taxes. ''I work with a lot of clients in New York, Connecticut and New Jersey -- so all high-tax states -- and we are seeing a lot of them move south, especially to Florida,'' said Robert Westley, a New York City-based certified public accountant. ''With almost all of our clients it comes up, and I would say about half of them are really looking into it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An added incentive for moving is the fact that the new legislation preserved a tax break that allows married homeowners who sell their primary residence to shield up to $500,000 of their capital gains from the property, Mr. Westley said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shahab Karmaly, the founder of KAR Properties, a real estate development and investment firm, currently lives in Manhattan, but has been taking steps to relocate his family and business to Miami. ''If I didn't have the added complexity of kids, then I would already be down there,'' said Mr. Karmaly, who has been touring schools for his children in Miami.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, the Florida housing market has seen a bump since the tax law was enacted. In Naples, for example, sales of single-family homes priced at $2 million and above rose 25 percent in the second quarter of 2018, compared with the second quarter of last year, according to the <span class="companylink">Naples Area Board of Realtors</span>. Pending sales of such homes in Naples are up 22 percent, while pending sales of similarly priced condominiums have risen 32 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Causality is difficult to quantify, but taxes are certainly playing a role,'' said Niklas Ahola, a real estate adviser at Compass in Naples. ''I have about 10 clients, including three from New York, who are fleeing high-tax states.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the housing market in New York has slowed this year, and real estate analysts believe that is also in part because of the tax changes. Home sales in Manhattan declined 16.6 percent in the second quarter of this year compared with the same period last year, according to <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>. In Westchester, sales dropped 17.7 percent; in the <span class="companylink">Hamptons</span>, they fell 12.8 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People have pressed the pause button and are waiting before they buy,'' said Jonathan Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel, which conducted the research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Brooklyn, housing sales also decreased in the second quarter, but at a more modest 5.7 percent. This may be in part because home values in the borough are lower, making property taxes lower and dampening the impact of the tax law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the new legislation largely benefits the wealthy and corporations, it hasn't translated into a boon for high-end real estate in New York, Mr. Miller said. ''When this was first announced, people said it would have no impact because they were going to get more money back on taxes,'' he said. ''But people don't buy individual assets based on a basket of assets. It isn't like people say, 'I will pay more for my house because I got money back from taxes.' It just doesn't work that way.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some prospective buyers have focused their searches on buildings with tax abatements to limit their tax costs. Buyers at 550 Vanderbilt, a new development in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, for example, benefit from a 25-year tax abatement. Owners of studios at the building pay as little as $18 a month in property taxes, compared to $563 a month without the abatement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was a huge factor in our decision to buy here,'' said Rebecca Miller, 33, who purchased a two-bedroom at 550 Vanderbilt with her husband, Adam Tau. ''We got our recent tax bill, and it worked out to be about $42 a month. It would have been closer to $1,500 a month without the abatement,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Ryan Serhant, the associate broker with <span class="companylink">Nest Seekers International</span> who is handling sales at 550 Vanderbilt, said that since the tax changes were implemented, ''we have seen a massive uptick in people coming from Manhattan. Before the tax law passed, people paid attention to real estate taxes, but if it was a little more, they just wrote it off. Now you can't do that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While it is clear that the tax changes are already having an impact on the real estate market, it is too early to know the full extent of the repercussions, said Adam Kamins, a senior regional economist at Moody's Analytics. In New York, while there has already been a slowdown, ''the adjustment will take some time, both to show up in house prices and to be fully internalized by buyers and sellers,'' he said. ''In fact, it may not truly happen for many until they file their tax returns next spring.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">American Institute of Certified Public Accountants</span> said that its accountants are exploring new ways to keep their clients' tax bills down. One strategy would be to claim part of a home as a business expense. If a taxpayer has a home office, for example, or a room leased to a tenant or through <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span>, it can be counted as a business expense and deducted, over and above the $10,000 cap on tax deductions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The rules are a little complicated, but if you qualify, and let's say you have a home office that takes up 15 percent of the square footage of your home, you could take 15 percent off your property taxes and deduct it,'' Mr. Westley said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Want to better understand what may happen in the United States economy as President Trump pursues his combative trade policies?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Look no further than the lumber that goes into many houses in the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long before the sharp clash with Canada at the Group of 7 meeting this weekend, the Trump administration imposed tariffs on lumber imports from Canada, which American home builders use in large quantities. The United States Commerce Department contended that Canadian companies were selling lumber into the United States at unfair, subsidized prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those tariffs, which took effect last year, combined with other factors to drive up the price of lumber in the United States. As a result, the anti-dumping and countervailing duties, as the tariffs are officially known, have added to the cost of housing in the United States at a time when homes are becoming less affordable. The Trump administration’s tariffs on steel and aluminum, and any others that follow, could also contribute to rising costs for businesses and consumers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, defended the lumber tariffs. “Anti-dumping and countervailing duty determinations provide the domestic industry with relief from dumping and improper subsidies,” he said in a statement to The <span class="companylink">New York Times</span> last week. “Price fluctuations from other factors are not part of the calculus.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tariffs might be expected to push up the price of a good to a certain level, but in this case, the price of Canadian lumber kept rising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cost of 1,000 board feet of western Canadian lumber is up nearly 80 percent over the past 12 months, including about 40 percent this year, according to data from Random Lengths, a publication that covers the lumber market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What caused this unusual rise? Paul F. Jannke, a principal at Forest Economic Advisors, a firm that analyzes the lumber market, said that the tariffs had contributed to the ascent. But, he added, a reduction in the supply of Canadian lumber, caused by recent rail slowdowns and tree disease, played a big role. Mr. Ross, in his statement, noted these causes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The prices have gone up by much more than the tariffs because of supply and demand factors,” he said. “The purpose of the tariffs was to level the playing field for the Americans.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first quarter of 2018, the United States imported 3.07 billion board feet of Canadian lumber, down 15 percent from 3.63 billion board feet a year earlier, according to data from Forest Economic Advisors. Also, Canadian lumber imports in the first quarter were equivalent to 36 percent of United States domestic lumber production, down from 42 percent in all of 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is this evidence that the tariffs have priced the Canadians out of the United States market, allowing American producers to fill the gap? Probably not. The declines in Canadian shipments are more the result of tree disease and the slower rail transportation than tariffs, Mr. Jannke said. Also, United States lumber production does not appear to be growing at a faster rate. In the first quarter, it was up 3 percent over a year earlier. In 2017, it grew at a 4.4 percent annual rate. It will take a long time for American producers to add a significant amount of new capacity, Mr. Jannke added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Large Canadian lumber producers have done well financially despite the trade friction. The stock of <span class="companylink">West Fraser Timber</span>, a big Canadian producer, has gained 53 percent in the last 12 months, and its 2018 first-quarter earnings rose 60 percent from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The tariffs did not constrain Canadian production nor was that their purpose,” Mr. Ross said in his statement. “Their purpose was to protect the U.S. lumber industry from subsidized softwood lumber dumping. These tariffs will be most beneficial to the U.S. producers in the next down cycle. In an up cycle, everyone benefits.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But such words may not satisfy United States home builders, who are grappling with the much higher lumber prices while other costs — like wages — are also going up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’ve had conversations with the White House, Secretary Ross directly and the U.S. trade representative,” said Jerry Howard, chief executive of the National Association of Home Builders. “We are trying to sound the alarm here.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the rise in housing prices, the number of homes being built has not picked up to the levels of past upswings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past 12 months, monthly housing starts, expressed at an annual rate, have averaged 1.24 million units, well below the 1.96 million average units from 2003 through 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, many home builders are passing on their higher costs to home buyers. In recent months, executives from publicly traded home builders have told their shareholders that they expect to maintain their profit margins even as their costs rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The profitability of home builders has not escaped Mr. Ross’s notice. “Home prices have risen by much more than the increase in lumber prices, and this is reflected in the strong profit margins of the home builders,” he said.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">VALLEJO, Calif. -- California is in the middle of an affordable-housing crisis that cities across the state are struggling to solve. Rick Holliday, a longtime Bay Area real estate developer, thinks one answer lies in an old shipyard in Vallejo, about 40 minutes northeast of San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here, in a football-field-sized warehouse where workers used to make submarines, Mr. Holliday recently opened Factory OS, a factory that manufactures homes. In one end go wood, pipes, tile, sinks and toilets; out another come individual apartments that can be trucked to a construction site and bolted together in months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If we don't build housing differently, then no one can have any housing,'' Mr. Holliday said during a recent tour, as he passed assembly-line workstations and stacks of raw materials like windows, pipes and rolls of pink insulation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost a decade after the recession flattened the housing industry, causing waves of contractors to go bankrupt and laid-off construction workers to leave the business for other jobs, builders have yet to regain their previous form. Today the pace of new apartment and housing construction sits at a little over half the 2006 peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The United States needs new housing, but its building industry isn't big enough to provide it. The number of residential construction workers is 23 percent lower than in 2006, while higher-skill trades like plumbers, carpenters and electricians are down close to 17 percent. With demand for housing high and the supply of workers short, builders are bidding up prices for the limited number of contractors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction prices nationwide have risen about 5 percent a year for the past three years, according to the Turner Building Cost Index. Costs have gone up even faster in big cities and across California, according to RSMeans, a unit of Gordian, which compiles construction data. In the Bay Area, builders say construction prices are up 30 percent over the past three years -- so much that even luxury projects are being stalled by rising costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's reached the point where you cannot get enough rent or you cannot sell enough units to make it a viable deal,'' said Lou Vasquez, a founding partner and managing director of Build, a real estate developer in San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surge in construction prices is coming at the worst possible time for booming cities like New York, Seattle and San Francisco, already dealing with an affordable-housing crunch that has increased the homeless populations and stoked acrimonious debates about growth and gentrification. City and state legislators have tried to tackle their housing problems with proposals to increase subsidized affordable housing, reduce building regulations and make it legal to build taller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even if every overpriced city suddenly overcame the thicket of zoning rules and neighborhood opposition that make it difficult to build new housing in the first place -- which seems doubtful -- today's diminished building industry would lack the capacity to build at the needed pace. This affects the rich as well as the poor, because it raises the cost of high-end condos and affordable housing alike.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later this year, California residents will vote on a proposed $4 billion bond to build more subsidized affordable housing. In San Francisco, where developers say the per-unit construction cost is edging toward $800,000, that would buy about 5,000 units, a relative blip. ''Costs have risen so much that it is not possible to build homes where people want to live at the prices and rents they can afford,'' said John Burns, founder of <span class="companylink">John Burns Real Estate Consulting</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All this has prompted developers like Mr. Holliday to go scrambling for cheaper and less labor-intensive construction methods -- and investors to pour money into start-ups that promise to do just that. Katerra, a three-year-old prefabricated building company in the Silicon Valley city of Menlo Park, has raised $1.1 billion in venture capital. A number of other building start-ups including Blokable, based in Seattle; Kasita, based in Austin, Tex.; and RAD Urban, based in Oakland, Calif., have all popped up over the past five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The current system can't meet demand and that's resulting in a lack of opportunity for some folks and a major hit to the economy,'' said Stonly Baptiste, a co-founder of Urban Us, a Brooklyn-based venture capital firm that invested in Blokable. ''These aren't small problems and they aren't small markets.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The technologies vary but generally involve simplifying construction through prefabricated panels that can be assembled like <span class="companylink">Ikea</span> furniture and modular apartments that can be stacked together like Lego bricks. A recent survey by FMI, a management-consulting and investment banking company focused on the engineering and construction industry, found a third of respondents said they were looking at some form of off-site construction, a steep rise from 2010. The interest extends from housing to hotels to medical facilities, industrial companies and even fast-food restaurants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's one of those things that looks like an overnight success but it's taken 10 years and hundreds of people toiling,'' said Chris Giattina, chief executive of BLOX, a Birmingham, Ala., company that builds hospitals with modular components.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers of Risk</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The global construction industry is a $10 trillion behemoth whose structures determine where people live, how they get to work and what cities look like. It is also one of the world's least efficient businesses. The construction productivity rate -- how much building workers do for each hour of labor they put in -- has been flat since 1945, according to the <span class="companylink">McKinsey Global Institute</span>. Over that period, sectors like agriculture, manufacturing and retail saw their productivity rates surge by as much as 1,500 percent. In other words, while the rest of the economy has been supercharged by machines, computers and robots, construction companies are about as efficient as they were in World War II.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To understand this, consider how buildings are actually built. It all starts with the developer, who doesn't actually build anything but instead secures a piece of land and a loan, and gets the project approved by the government. At that point the money is passed to the general contractor that made a successful bid to build the project, who passes it to subcontractors that won the bidding for things like plumbing and sheet metal work, which often pass it to even more subcontractors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contractors describe this handoff as ''brokering risk.'' What they mean is that while everyone in the chain has agreed to build a certain piece of the project for a set amount of money and in a given amount of time, none of them are sure they can do so as cheaply or quickly as they've promised. They broker that risk by paying someone else to do it for them, minus a small fee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Say you're a general contractor and your subcontractor agrees to do a job. Once we have a contract I don't care how many man hours you put into it because that's your problem now,'' said Randy Miller, chief executive of RAD Urban, describing the thinking behind the process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The goal of prefabricated building companies is to turn this model on its head. Instead of offloading risk, the contractor assumes all of it. Instead of sending jobs to subcontractors, they hire their own factory workers. ''The general contractor says, 'Oh my God, construction is scary, let me broker all that risk,''' Mr. Miller said. ''I'm saying, 'Oh my God, construction is scary, let me plan and control it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The basic concept isn't new. In 1624, Massachusetts settlers built homes out of prefabricated materials shipped from England. The pattern was repeated in Australia, Africa and India as the British Empire shipped colonists and structures wide across the globe, according to ''Prefab Architecture,'' by Ryan E. Smith, a professor at the University of Utah.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the next few centuries, new versions of the idea seemed to pop up anywhere people needed to build lots of homes in a hurry -- during the California Gold Rush, after the Chicago fire, and through America's westward expansion. In the early part of the 20th century, <span class="companylink">Sears</span> sold tens of thousands of kits for Sears Modern Homes, which consisted of prefabricated parts and panels that buyers assembled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along the way, the construction industry absorbed manufacturing concepts such as the assembly-line techniques that were utilized by Levitt &amp; Sons, the pioneer of mass-built subdivisions. But the idea of factory-built housing was never adopted long or widely enough to make an impact, at least in the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason the United States has lagged behind Europe, Australia and Asia -- which all have well-established companies doing modular and prefabricated building -- is that it is a predominantly suburban nation, and the vast supply of open land has kept the cost of single-family-home building relatively low. Another is that the construction industry has slim profit margins and invests little in research and development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chances of being burned are high, and each high-profile failure leads to a furlough of the concept. In the mid-2000s housing boom, <span class="companylink">Pulte Homes</span>, one of the country's largest builders, opened a prefabrication plant that aimed to revolutionize how homes were built. The company closed it with the onset of the housing bust in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, instead of single-family homes, companies doing prefab building are focusing on higher-density condominiums and apartments. That's because, while single-family home construction remains well below its level before the recession, multifamily condominium and apartment buildings have rebounded strongly. ''Our goal is to be able to do a 40-story tower in 12 months, at half the cost of traditional construction,'' said Mr. Miller of RAD Urban.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, even if builders are able to reduce construction costs, that doesn't necessarily mean they will be successful. Behind each of these companies is a bet that they can build far more efficiently than current methods. That bet has yet to be proven, at least on a large scale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Efficiency vs. Workers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Holliday of Factory OS started thinking about modular housing about four years ago, when he was struggling to build a project in Truckee, Calif., a mountain town of about 15,000 people near Lake Tahoe. The idea was to build a cluster of 800 to 1,000 high-density apartments and condominiums, but ''the numbers wouldn't work,'' he said. ''You couldn't get the construction costs down enough.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Holliday floated the idea of modular building to his longtime contractor, Larry Pace, from Cannon Constructors, who over the past four decades has built various projects from one-off homes to high-rise condo and office towers. ''I said 'modular jobs have been a fiasco -- we don't need that in our lives,''' Mr. Pace recalled, adding an expletive for emphasis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Holliday persisted, and he and Mr. Pace used modular technology from two manufacturers to build four projects in the Bay Area. They are planning to do the same with the original Truckee development. Mr. Pace became so comfortable with modular that he suggested that they find some investors and build a factory of their own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a recent afternoon, Mr. Pace laid out the factory's process. At the first station, just past the door, four workers toiled above and below a raised platform to build what would eventually become the floor. The two men up top laid down flooring while a man and woman stood below simultaneously installing pipes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From there the unit would move steadily down the line, and, over 21 additional stations, would acquire toilets, indoor walls, outdoor walls, a roof, electric outlets, windows, sinks, countertops and tiling. It takes about a week to finish a unit, Mr. Pace said. The goal is to churn out about 2,000 apartments a year, which would be turned into four- and five-story buildings with 80 to 150 units each.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For workers, factory building seems to mean lower wages but steadier work. Factory OS pays about $30 an hour with medical insurance and two weeks of vacation. That's about half what workers can make on a construction site, but the work is more regular and, for many, requires less commuting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tony Vandewark, a 51-year-old foreman at Factory OS, is OK with the trade-off. Mr. Vandewark lives a few minutes from the factory in Vallejo, where homes cost less than half what they do closer to San Francisco. Contrast that with a job he once had in the Silicon Valley city of Sunnyvale. Mr. Vandewark drove two hours to work and three hours home before deciding to rent a room so he could stay closer to work on weekdays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''On a job site, you can go do piece work and make really big money, but then the job is gone,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to not being rained on, one of the key differences between a construction site and Factory OS is that any worker can be trained to do any job. And for old-school trade unions, that is a declaration of war. ''The business model is 'Hooray for me,''' without regard for anyone else, said Larry Mazzola Jr., business manager of UA Local 38, a San Francisco plumbers' union with about 2,500 members across Northern California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Factory OS is not anti-union: It has a contract with the <span class="companylink">Northern California Carpenters Regional Council</span>, which has organized other modular factories and is banking on the technology's continued growth. The issue is that builders are laid out like a Detroit auto factory, where one union represents all of the workers, and workers can be trained to do any job within the company walls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is a huge departure from construction sites, where unions representing plumbers, electricians, carpenters and various other trades each control their piece of the building process. Last year Mr. Mazzola wrote a letter to San Francisco's mayor, Ed Lee, a month before he died, urging him to deny any city business -- such as contracts for subsidized housing -- to Factory OS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Any decision to use Factory OS shows a blatant disregard for the other craft unions,'' he wrote. He asked the mayor to refrain from contracting with the company unless it allowed craft unions to do their pieces of the work. ''We realize modular is coming and we want to be part of it, but not at the expense of our workers, which is what's happening right now,'' Mr. Mazzola said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jay Bradshaw, director of organizing for the carpenters' council representing Factory OS workers, said that would be impractical. Think back to that first station, where four people worked above and below the floor. In Mr. Mazzola's world, a plumbers' union would represent the workers installing pipes, while other unions would represent the workers up top.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It would never work to have upward of 10 or 15 labor organizations at a single employer in a factory setting,'' Mr. Bradshaw said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Mr. Bradshaw, the real fight isn't defending job titles but making sure construction workers remain part of a union at all. A short drive from Factory OS, at a carpenters' training center, the union is developing a program to train housing-factory workers -- something that, it hopes, will prepare more people for an industry that it has come to see as inevitable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It sure blows the hell out of building in China,'' he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Good morning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Gavin Newsom is the lieutenant governor, a former San Francisco mayor and a leading Democrat to replace Gov. Jerry Brown. California Today has been doing occasional question-and-answer sessions with candidates for office. Today’s interview with Mr. Newsom, edited and condensed for clarity, was conducted for our article on the race.[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/03/us/california-governor-villaraigosa-newsom-trump.html]
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Were there things Jerry Brown did you would continue?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Oh, the “one that gets me in trouble” question. Brown’s perfect. (Laughs) Look — he’s done an extraordinary job. It’s important to remind folks where we were seven years ago: 12.4 percent unemployment, $27 billion budget deficit. Now we are having a raging debate about the size of the surplus. This state has turned a corner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. What has not gone right?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. We’re not all rowing in the same direction. We are the richest and the poorest state. Eight million living below the poverty line, 40 percent of our kids at or near the poverty line. Inequality is the issue that is going to define a good part of my tenure. To say it happened on our watch is accurate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Has the governor paid enough attention to homelessness?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. He has on the margins. But have we designed a framework to regionalize solutions and to have the state drive the effort? No. And I intend to do that. We have never had a governor particularly animated by homelessness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Do you support the proposal[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/16/business/energy-environment/climate-density.html] by Senator Scott Wiener to override local zoning and permit construction of eight-story housing near transit lines?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. I told him point blank, “I would not sign this bill, but I love what you are doing. How can I help?” No sooner than did we have that conversation than he’s already made substantive amendments, on rent control protection. He realizes one size does not fit all. The spirit of what he is doing is right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. I get the spirit. But what about the concept?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. It’s a crisis. We can’t live on intentions. At the end of the day, if you want to move the mouse, you’ve got to move the cheese. The middle class of the state is leaving in droves. This is a Code Red in California.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The astronomical costs of building the Second Avenue subway and other New York public transit projects are now the subject of a federal inquiry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Government Accountability Office</span> said on Wednesday that it was preparing to launch a study of why transit construction is so much more expensive in the United States than in other parts of the world. Special attention is expected to be paid to New York City, where recent projects have cost far more than anticipated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Auditors plan to examine contracting policies, station design, project routing, regulatory barriers and other elements that drive cost, comparing practices in different cities in the United States and abroad, officials said. A final report with recommendations is to be issued by the end of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study was part of the spending bill that was approved by Congress last week. And it comes three months after an investigation by The <span class="companylink">New York Times</span> revealed how city and state public officials had stood by as a small group of politically connected labor unions, construction companies and consulting firms drove up transit construction costs and amassed large profits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first phase of the Second Avenue subway on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, for instance, cost $2.5 billion for each mile of track. Another project known as East Side Access, which will carry the <span class="companylink">Long Island Rail Road</span> to Grand Central Terminal through a 3.5-mile tunnel, is on pace to cost $3.5 billion per track mile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elsewhere in the world, a mile of subway track typically costs $500 million or less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's fantastic that people are really paying attention to this issue,'' said Dani Simons, a spokeswoman for the Regional Plan Association, a research and advocacy group that released its own report on high transit construction costs last month. ''We're very excited that they're doing this study.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the subways, said the authority was already acting to reduce construction costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The M.T.A. under new leadership is aggressively tackling these issues through working groups dedicated to procurement reform and containing construction costs,'' said the spokesman, Jon Weinstein. ''We are implementing new processes and procedures to streamline work, stop customization and reduce change orders -- all of which will help us drive down costs.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal inquiry is a milestone in more than a year of stop-and-start efforts in Washington to address the costs of transit construction. The Senate inserted the request for the <span class="companylink">Government Accountability Office</span> study in its spending plan last year, but it was stripped out in negotiations with the House.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, amid a crisis of delays on the New York subway system, an amended version of the provision calling for the study survived the final budget negotiations and made it into the spending bill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Not later than 9 months after the enactment of this act, the G.A.O. shall report to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations regarding the construction costs of transit capital projects in the United States in comparison to other developed G-20 nations, such as South Korea, Japan, Spain, France, Italy and Germany,'' the provision states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All those countries have completed major construction projects in the last decade that cost far less than American projects. The extension of the 14 Line in Paris, for example, was very similar to the Second Avenue subway project in length, depth, soil type, environmental issues and regulations, but it cost just $450 million per track mile. In Madrid, a project to extend the 2 Line, completed in 2011, cost just $100 million per track mile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American transit construction generally is more expensive than work completed abroad, but recent projects in New York have cost far more than elsewhere in the country. In San Francisco, for example, the 1.7-mile central subway is being built for about $1 billion per track mile. The University Link project in Seattle cost around $500 million per track mile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Times investigation found that the high costs were the result, in part, of generous contracts, excessive staffing and archaic work rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One member of the M.T.A. board, Charles G. Moerdler, summarized the problems: ''Is it rigged? Yes. I don't think it's corrupt. But I think people like doing business with people they know, and so a few companies get all the work, and they can charge whatever they want.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property taxes can be a large part of your housing budget, depending on where you live. In New Jersey, the state with the highest property tax rate, a home assessed at $300,000 would generate a $7,200 tax bill. Compare that to just $810 in Hawaii, the state with the lowest rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But home prices vary geographically, so while property taxes are lowest in Hawaii, the state's median home price -- at $538,400 in 2016 -- is among the highest in the nation. (The median home price nationwide in 2016 was $184,700.)

</div><div class="author">By BRIAN M. ROSENTHAL </div><div>872 words</div><div>6 February 2018</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>18</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2018 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Metropolitan Transportation Authority</span> could dramatically reduce its sky-high construction costs by rethinking how it manages projects, prioritizing efficiency over bureaucracy and ending rules that require far more workers than are needed, according to a new report based on two years of research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report, scheduled to be published on Tuesday by the Regional Plan Association, an urban research and advocacy group, says that dozens of missteps, abuses and inefficiencies have helped to make New York City the most expensive place in the world for public transit projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among other factors, the report's authors found that recent megaprojects like the first phase of the Second Avenue Subway on Manhattan's Upper East Side have suffered from overly burdensome environmental reviews, repeated political interference, out-of-date work rules, ''excessive customization'' and a lack of coordination, communication and accountability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The extraordinarily high costs are due to many factors at every stage, from decisions by political leaders at the inception of a project to the final stages of a lengthy process of planning, design, and construction,'' wrote the authors, Richard Barone, Julia Vitullo-Martin and Alyssa Pichardo. ''Long tolerated as an accepted natural consequence of New York's size and dominance, these costs threaten to strangle New York's future economic growth.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to the Second Avenue Subway, the report examines the extension of the No. 7 Line to the Far West Side of Manhattan and East Side Access, a project, still underway, to link the <span class="companylink">Long Island Rail Road</span> to Grand Central Terminal through a 3½-mile-long tunnel. The report compares the projects with similarly ambitious transit projects in London, Paris and Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report largely echoes the findings of an investigation published by The <span class="companylink">New York Times</span> in December. That investigation found that a mile of train track in New York cost at least five times as much as anywhere else in the world, an inefficient use of money that had sapped funding that could have been used to fix the aging subway system. It blamed public officials who stood by as a small group of politically connected labor unions, construction companies and consulting firms amassed large profits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Regional Plan Association report goes a step further by recommending 11 different measures to rein in costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The transportation authority should create a separate management agency to run each megaproject, according to the report, which cites a similar model that is used in London. Officials also should streamline the environmental review process, expand the use of design-build contracting rather than have separate contracts for each, and allow the use of private workers for more tasks, the authors recommend. Work rules should be changed to reduce unnecessary staffing and overtime, they say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report also notes a variety of ways that other transit systems achieve efficiencies, including private-public partnerships, innovative insurance policies, and performance bonuses for workers and contractors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Together, the changes could cut construction costs by a third, the group said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response to a request for comment, an M.T.A. spokesman, Jon Weinstein, said in an email: ''Tackling outsized capital costs is a key goal of the M.T.A.'s new leadership team. Chairman Lhota created a board task force to specifically and aggressively attack this problem. Among other things, as part of this initiative M.T.A. leadership is working to streamline the procurement process, stop customization of components, reduce change orders, chop huge costs and delays associated with utility relocations, and more effectively manage projects across the board. We look forward to reviewing the report.'' The authority's chairman is Joseph J. Lhota.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report is likely to spur discussion at a time when state lawmakers are debating how to address the failing subway system. Only about 65 percent of trains now reach their destination on time, the lowest level in decades and the lowest of any major rapid transit system in the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a second-term Democrat who controls the M.T.A., which operates the subway and the region's buses and commuter railroads, has proposed a congestion pricing system for vehicles entering Manhattan's most crowded neighborhoods to increase funding for public transit. But some critics have resisted, saying the authority should prove it can wisely spend money before getting more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Councilwoman Helen Rosenthal, Democrat of Manhattan, called the report's proposals ''a great start.'' In particular, Ms. Rosenthal, who last fall led a group of council members who sent a letter to the authority demanding an independent commission to study the costs, praised the idea of the special management agencies for each project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The M.T.A.'s sky-high costs aren't some immutable fact of nature; they're the result of flawed processes and outdated practices,'' she said. ''What's been desperately needed has been a willingness to shake up those practices, to bring in new competition and innovation, and to make the M.T.A. accountable to the public.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NANJING, China -- China has tried just about everything to tame a property market in which home prices sometimes jump around like the value of Bitcoin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the years, in one city or another, it has limited mortgage lending. It has tried to halt purchases of homes by people who already own one. It has plowed billions of dollars into building new homes that regular Chinese people can afford.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the Chinese government is considering adopting something that, while familiar to homeowners in the United States and elsewhere, could dramatically reshape the world's second-largest economy: a property tax.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Living in a place without property taxes may sound appealing, but a growing number of experts and policymakers in China say the absence of one has helped destabilize a vast and crucial part of the Chinese economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many investors snap up homes -- in China, they are mostly apartments -- hoping to ride a price surge. In the biggest cities, property prices on average have at least doubled over the past eight years. But vast numbers of apartments in many cities lie empty, either because the buyers have no intention of moving in or renting out, or because speculators built homes that nobody wants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October, Xi Jinping, China's president, told the nation that ''houses are built to be inhabited, not for speculation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate fervor was on display on a chilly recent morning at an apartment complex in the eastern city of Nanjing. Would-be buyers spent the night in tents and under quilts, lined up for a chance to buy. So many cars arrived, according to people who were there and photos that went viral on social media, that traffic seized up for a mile around the sales office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There were a lot of speculators,'' said Han Changlong, a Nanjing real estate inspector who attended the event. ''Some people believe that if they don't buy now, homes will become more expensive in the future.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A tax is far from assured, and lawmakers have not indicated that one will be on the table when they hold their annual meeting in March. Still, experts say momentum is building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Xiao Jie, the finance minister, wrote in late December in People's Daily, the Communist Party's official newspaper, that leaders at a major party meeting two months earlier had favored instituting such a tax. The slogan, Mr. Xiao said, would be ''Legislation first, full authorization, move forward step by step.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A property tax could have a profound impact on a crucial part of the nation's economy. Real estate makes up nearly three-quarters of the assets of Chinese households, according to the Survey and Research Center for China Household Finance, an academic institute in Chengdu, in southwestern China. That compares with a bit more than one-third for United States households. Roughly a fifth to a quarter of China's annual economic output comes from property and related industries, like furniture making.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But housing is also the source of some of the country's biggest booms and busts. Local investors -- many of whom do not trust the country's stock markets and are forbidden by Beijing to move most of their wealth abroad -- simply throw money at housing. Real estate broker fees, often as low as 1 percent, are a small fraction of the typical 6 percent in the United States. Mortgage lending has leapt over the past two years, adding to the potential for financial turbulence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing in Beijing and Shanghai has soared beyond the reach of even many affluent families and speculators -- at least for now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other factors spur frantic buying, such as access to local government services, as well as cultural forces that emphasize homeownership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ma Xiaoguang, a 31-year-old mechanical engineer, and his wife recently bought an apartment for $227,000 in the farthest outskirts of Shanghai so their daughter could get permission to attend a nearby public school. But they do not live there, instead renting a place in a more expensive neighborhood. They found a tenant for their purchased apartment, but for only $180 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I know the yield is too low,'' Mr. Ma said, ''but I want to have a home, and an apartment makes my family and me feel safe.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not clear whether a property tax would cover all homes, or just second ones. Much of China would be starting from scratch, as the country does not have decades of real estate records like the United States and other places.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One longtime obstacle -- figuring out who owns which apartment -- appears to have been resolved. For years, many corrupt government officials accumulated homes and resisted creating a database of real estate records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But motivated partly by Mr. Xi's nationwide corruption crackdown, the Ministry of Land and Resources announced in September that it had just completed a database of land ownership across the country. Real estate executives say that the database encompasses the beneficial owners of real estate held through companies and investment partnerships, although wealthy individuals in China have been known to disguise the extent of their holdings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's absence of a property tax is a legacy of the 1949 Communist takeover. Land ownership was gradually restricted, then banned. When the leadership allowed private citizens to become homeowners again after Mao's death, it created a system under which the government leased land to developers and others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Introducing the tax would be a delicate task for a government prone to ham-handed policy changes. It could damage demand in places where thousands of new apartments are still coming onto the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What would happen if real estate prices keep stable?'' said Li Xunlei, the chief economist at Zhongtai Securities in Jinan, in the east. ''We have many speculators, and they may find it unnecessary to hold real estate that does not increase in value.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, cultural forces could set a floor. Young people in China are expected to buy a home before they can get married. Usually the groom is responsible for buying a home, though the bride's family frequently chips in. Thanks to the now-abandoned one-child policy, China has more young men than young women, setting off a male-led surge to buy homes to make themselves more appealing husbands. Shang-Jin Wei, a Columbia University business professor, found that rising real estate price increases in 35 big cities were strongly correlated with lopsided gender ratios.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jerry Lu, a 24-year-old insurance salesman, said he was determined to buy an apartment so that his girlfriend would feel more secure. He waited in a long line in November in his hometown, Deyang, in the southwest, and bought one of the last apartments available, incurring a mortgage that will claim a third of his income for monthly payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't care if there is a real estate tax next year,'' he said. ''No matter what, I need to buy one.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Undermining another Obama-era initiative, the Trump administration plans to delay enforcement of a federal housing rule that requires communities to address patterns of racial residential segregation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>, in a notice to be published Friday in the Federal Register, says it will suspend until 2020 the requirement that communities analyze their housing segregation and submit plans to reverse it, as a condition of receiving billions of federal dollars in block grants and housing aid. The notice tells cities already at work on the detailed plans required by the rule that they no longer need to submit them, and the department says it will stop reviewing plans that have already been filed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move does not repeal the 2015 rule, a product of years of pressure from civil rights groups and review by the Obama administration. HUD argues that it is trying to respond to cities that have struggled with the rule's requirements, delaying it for several years while the agency further invests in the tools communities use to assess their housing patterns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Early in this administration, HUD embarked upon a top-to-bottom review of the department's rules and regulations,'' the agency said in a statement. ''As part of this regulatory review, HUD asked the public to offer comment on those rules that might be excessively burdensome or unclear. What we heard convinced us that the Assessment of Fair Housing tool for local governments wasn't working well.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But advocates say the notice effectively strangles the federal government's first major commitment in decades to address racial inequality in housing, burying it in calls for more analysis and preparation. Diane Yentel, president of the <span class="companylink">National Low Income Housing Coalition</span>, called the move misguided and shortsighted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's terrible news,'' said Gustavo Velasquez, who was the assistant secretary for fair housing and equal opportunity at HUD during the final three years of the Obama administration. ''I am concerned, though, that this is not actually the worst news.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the delay, he fears that the Trump administration will entirely undo the rule, which has been a goal of many Republicans in Congress ever since it was adopted. Critics of the rule -- including Ben Carson, before he became HUD secretary -- argue that it amounts to an aggressive intrusion by the federal government into some of the most intimate decisions local citizens and communities make: about where to live, who lives next door and how to design their neighborhoods. Since joining the agency, Mr. Carson has said that he wants to ''reinterpret'' the rule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HUD's notice argues that a delay is necessary because local communities need more technical assistance from the agency and have struggled to figure out how to measure their progress toward affirming fair housing. The agency notes that among the first 49 assessments submitted, about a third were initially returned by HUD as unacceptable. But the system was designed to include that kind of back and forth, former HUD officials said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sara Pratt, a former deputy assistant secretary for fair housing at the agency, said HUD had provided consultants and a hotline that jurisdictions could call for help. Many of the communities that fell short on their assessments had simply failed to follow HUD's road map, said Ms. Pratt, who left the department in November 2015 and now works as a civil rights lawyer in private practice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's like having a teacher in a classroom saying, 'Too many people aren't passing the test, so I'm just going to change the test,' '' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What worries her most, she said, is that HUD will allow cities to revert to prior standards for assessing fair housing. Under the old system, many cities submitted assessments that were of poor quality and lacked basic data, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ben Metcalf, director of the <span class="companylink">California Department of Housing and Community Development</span>, said the 2015 rule had spurred local and statement governments to understand their housing patterns and make smarter policy decisions around them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some cities, like Philadelphia, have already finished their assessments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Chrystie, a spokesman for Philadelphia's Division of Housing and Community Development, said the process was critical in getting comments from the community and from a range of sectors -- like education, transportation and banking. One important thing they learned was that residents did not want to move from their distressed neighborhoods, but wanted to see them improved, he said. That led to programs to expand pre-K and to improve libraries, parks and recreation centers, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York City is scheduled to begin the community outreach for its review this year. ''We're confident in the approach New York City is taking,'' Leila Bozorg, the deputy commissioner of neighborhood strategies for the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, said in a statement. ''This will include working closely with a diverse group of experts, practitioners and advocates and hearing directly from New Yorkers about their housing needs and how where they live impacts their life.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama rule was devised to address unfinished business of the 1968 Fair Housing Act, which forbids discrimination in the housing market based on race, color, religion, sex and national origin. The original language of the law also required communities to ''affirmatively further'' fair housing -- to, in effect, promote desegregation in addition to prohibiting discrimination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government never fully enforced that element of the law, however. And 50 years after the Fair Housing Act was passed, many communities have made little progress toward desegregation, while some programs funded with federal support have had the effect of reinforcing segregation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2015 rule -- the ''affirmatively furthering fair housing rule'' -- required communities to analyze policies that contribute to segregation. These might include locating low-income housing projects only in black neighborhoods, or barring multifamily housing from neighborhoods with good schools. The rule broadly required analysis of housing opportunities available not just to minorities, but also to the disabled, the poor and other disadvantaged groups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new HUD notice reiterates that local communities still have a legal obligation to further fair housing, and to pledge that they're doing so. But a reversion to the policies in place before the 2015 rule makes critics fear that the government will go back to a time when it turned a blind eye to segregation, giving taxpayer dollars to communities actively thwarting a central goal of the Fair Housing Act.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It says 'segregate as usual,' '' said Myron Orfield, a law professor at the University of Minnesota.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2015 rule was imperfect, he said, but it also amounted to the federal government's first major effort to strengthen civil rights around housing since the Lyndon Johnson era.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Residential segregation is at the heart of racial inequality in the country,'' Mr. Orfield said. ''All of the disparities in the U.S. -- in education, in income, wealth, employment, health -- between the races are all fundamentally linked to residential segregation. There's no real way to deal with disparities between black and white people without dealing with this.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York City has introduced a new website that gives the public a peek at Department of Buildings data across the boroughs. Among the insights it offers is a rundown of construction permits issued between 2000 and 2016. The types of building permits and where they were issued tell the story of recent growth in the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan led in the number of two common construction permits, types A2 and A3, that pertain to jobs that do not make changes to use, occupancy or egress. Two other permits that do allow such changes are the subject of this week's chart: Type NB, for new building, and type A1, which allows major alterations that will change use, occupancy or egress -- that is, new or expanded homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The highest number of NB and A1 permits were issued in Queens, with Brooklyn close behind, dramatically illustrating how the two boroughs have grown.</p>

Lennar and CalAtlantic Join To Form Home-Building Giant</span>
</div><div class="author">By CHAD BRAY and MATTHEW GOLDSTEIN </div><div>805 words</div><div>31 October 2017</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2017 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home-building sector in the United States has faced an array of challenges, including natural disasters, a long-running labor shortage and increased regulatory costs. Now, two of the nation's biggest residential-construction companies are merging in hopes that their combined heft will help them counter those forces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Lennar Corporation</span> said on Monday that it would merge with the <span class="companylink">CalAtlantic Group</span> to form America's largest home builder in a stock-and-cash deal worth $5.7 billion. The deal would create a behemoth with around 240,000 building plots in 21 states, a market value of about $18 billion and combined revenue of $17 billion over the past 12 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Lennar</span> and CalAtlantic anticipate reaping $250 million in annual cost savings and paying down debt obligations. But the deal will not alter a basic problem: The construction of new homes in the United States lags below historical averages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A decade after the big housing bust dealt a blow to many smaller home builders, the industry's largest firms continue to grapple with higher regulatory expenses that make building homes -- especially starter homes -- too costly, some housing-finance experts said. The situation confounds some people, given the pressing need for affordable housing for young families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Laurie Goodman, a director of housing-finance policy for the Urban Institute, said the nation suffered from a ''huge supply shortage'' of new single-family homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The underlying structural problem is we are not building enough homes and homes are costly to build,'' Ms. Goodman said. ''We all agree that more things should be handicapped accessible and new homes should be hurricane proof, but there is a cost associated.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right now, the home-building industry is dealing with a new cost: the impact of natural disasters, including Hurricanes Harvey and Irma in the South and devastating wildfires in Northern California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New construction in the South fell 9.3 percent last month, largely because of the hurricanes. And housing starts across the country declined 4.7 percent to 1.127 million units in September, a low for the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eventually the damage caused by the hurricanes and fires in California could lead to a surge in construction in a handful of states. But finding the workers to build those homes could be a challenge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Six in 10 home builders had trouble attracting the right workers during the third quarter of the year, according to a survey published last month. Another 30 percent said they had moderate difficulty finding such workers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By merging, <span class="companylink">Lennar</span> and CalAtlantic hope their size will help them achieve ''efficiencies in purchasing'' and gain ''access to land, labor and overhead allocation,'' Stuart Miller, Lennar's chief executive, said in a news release.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The combined company will have a strong balance sheet and generate significant cash flow available to pay down debt and repurchase shares,'' Mr. Miller said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist with <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>, an online residential real estate listing firm, said he hoped the merged companies would eventually use their heft to increase production of new homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''At face value, I was very excited to hear about this merger because inventory is hovering near historic lows, and that hurts home buyers and renters very hard,'' Mr. McLaughlin said. But, he said, he was then disappointed to learn that the intent, for now, ''was not to ramp up production but to gain efficiencies that will be used to pay down debt.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the deal's terms, CalAtlantic shareholders would receive 0.885 <span class="companylink">Lennar</span> shares for each CalAtlantic share. That would equate to $51.34 a share, a 27 percent premium above CalAtlantic's closing price on Friday. The transaction values CalAtlantic at $9.3 billion, including debt.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Legislators in three Midwestern states are taking steps to protect consumers who buy cheap and often rundown homes from investors through seller-financed deals or rent-to-own leases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The legislative initiatives in Ohio, Illinois and Michigan come as the <span class="companylink">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</span> continues to investigate the activities of some of the larger firms in the seller-financing home business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of rundown homes on long-term installment contracts -- sometimes called contracts for deeds or land contracts -- to people who could not qualify for a traditional mortgage are surging in several states, especially in the Midwest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seller-financed deals can provide a path to homeownership because the monthly payments can be less than the prevailing monthly rents in some neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But such transactions have had a long history of abuse: Buyers can be easily evicted for missing just a single payment, and the homes are often sold in a state of disrepair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, the deals have made a comeback over the past decade because the housing crisis created a ready supply of foreclosed homes for speculators and investment firms to buy and then resell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Ohio, Michele Lepore-Hagan, a Democratic state representative from Youngstown, introduced a bill on Tuesday that would require property owners to solve any housing code violations and pay outstanding fines before selling the homes to buyers in contract-for-deed transactions or in similarly structured rent-to-own leases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Illinois this year enacted a law, which will go into effect in January, that strengthens disclosure requirements with seller-financed deals. The measure, which had bipartisan support, gives buyers more time to come up with the money for a missed payment to prevent sellers from quickly evicting them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in Michigan, a group of state legislators led by Steve Bieda, a Democratic senator from suburban Detroit, has been working on a bill that would address similar abuses with contracts for deeds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Detroit, for example, cheap homes sold on contracts for deeds have consistently outpaced the number of homes sold in the city with traditional mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The flurry of legislative activity follows a series of articles by The <span class="companylink">New York Times</span> that shed light on the resurgence of the contract-for-deed market. The Times found that a number of national firms were selling homes in seller-financed deals without fully disclosing that some properties had housing code violations or thousands of dollars in unpaid taxes and other fees. Some homes that were sold were even condemned and slated for potential demolition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The series prompted officials in Wisconsin and Cincinnati to file civil lawsuits against several firms. Housing lawyers in Atlanta and Indianapolis also have filed lawsuits that contend firms operating in those cities have taken advantage of lower-income buyers.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finding a home in the United States has been getting tougher and tougher. The number of homes available for sale decreased 8.9 percent in the second quarter of 2017 compared to a year earlier, according to <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>, the real estate website, and this followed decreases every quarter for more than two years running.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But new homes are being built in some areas. In a recent study, <span class="companylink">Trulia</span> isolated the markets in which building permits for residential construction are being issued at rates above historical averages, which have been calculated by looking at the number of permits issued each year between 1980 and 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study also shows that three Texas cities, Austin, Dallas and Houston, issued over 10 percent of all permits in the nation in 2017. These cities are projected to add about 130,000 new homes by the end of the year, their growth driven by abundant jobs and rising incomes and home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To see which cities are issuing building permits at the highest and lowest rates relative to their historical averages, see our chart. For example, the projected number of new building permits in Austin in 2017 is more than 107 percent higher than Austin's historical average.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors are expected to approve Amazon's bid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shareholders of <span class="companylink">Whole Foods Market</span> are scheduled to meet Wednesday to vote on Amazon's $13.4 billion takeover bid for the grocery chain.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales figures may hint at continued economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The American economy is on increasingly solid footing, posting solid growth in consumer and business spending. This has led many economists to forecast that the United States' gross domestic product will grow at or around 3 percent this quarter -- a rate the economy hasn't hit since 2015. Will this pace hold? Two indicators this week -- new home sales in July, released Wednesday, and existing home sales that same month, released the next day -- will give added insight into whether the recent gains in consumer and business sentiment have filtered more broadly into the economy and housing market. Conor Dougherty</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed chairwoman is likely to address regulatory issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Janet Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, will deliver a speech on financial stability on Friday at the Fed's annual economic policy conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo. The Fed is widely expected to announce in September that it will begin to reduce its investment portfolio of Treasury securities and mortgage bonds, but Ms. Yellen is not expected to address monetary policy at the conference. Instead, the speech is likely to focus on regulatory issues. President Trump is seeking to loosen some of the constraints imposed on the financial industry in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Ms. Yellen and other Fed officials see room for improvement, but have cautioned against reversing those changes, which they regard as important protections against crises. This could be Ms. Yellen's last speech at Jackson Hole as Fed chairwoman. Her term ends in February, and Mr. Trump is considering whether to replace her. Binyamin Appelbaum</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span>'s chief may also demur on policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, will be the lunchtime speaker at the economic policy symposium in Wyoming. In 2014, Mr. Draghi used the same event to signal that the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> would begin a stimulus program based on purchases of government bonds. There had been speculation that he might use this appearance at Jackson Hole to signal that the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> was preparing to wind down the stimulus program. But lately, the central bank has been lowering expectations of a major policy speech. Jack Ewing

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, a verdict is expected in the trial of Lee Jae-yong, the vice chairman and heir apparent of <span class="companylink">Samsung Group</span>. Mr. Lee faces charges that he bribed South Korean government officials to solidify his family's control of <span class="companylink">Samsung</span>, one of the world's biggest business empires. Prosecutors recommended that Mr. Lee be sentenced to 12 years in prison and other <span class="companylink">Samsung</span> executives to 10 years in a trial that has been obsessively followed by the South Korean public. Analysts have said it is also a referendum on the country's commitment to punishing corporate oligarchs who have often been able to skirt tough sentences and convictions in the past. Paul Mozur</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of home sales in Brooklyn increased by nearly 51 percent in the second quarter of 2017 relative to the same quarter a year earlier, according to the 2017 Q2 Elliman Report from <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman Real Estate</span>. In contrast, sales in Manhattan were up by only about 15 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interestingly, Brooklyn sales increased despite the fact that there were almost 16 percent fewer homes available compared with a year earlier. Whereas in Manhattan, inventory stayed relatively flat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Brooklyn's continued boom is not just about more homes sold. Both median and average sale prices reached record highs as well. In fact, more than 23 percent of all sales closed above asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet record prices, low inventory and bidding wars don't tell the whole story. Sales of new-construction condos have surged, many of them high-priced luxury units. And in the second quarter of 2017 they made up 41 percent of the market, nearly double their share a year earlier.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the housing market collapsed more than a decade ago, new investors poured in to buy foreclosed homes and rent them out. Now, a $4.3 billion deal suggests that the bargain-hunting binge in housing is finally over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two of the biggest institutional single-family landlords in the United States said Thursday that they planned to merge, an indication that the housing market has recovered much of the ground it lost in the financial crisis. And as home prices rise in many areas, affordable housing, for deep-pocketed investors and young first-time buyers alike, is becoming harder to find.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two institutional landlords, <span class="companylink">Invitation Homes</span>, a rental business spun out of the private equity[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/p/private_equity/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] giant the Blackstone Group[http://www.nytimes.com/topic/company/the-blackstone-group?inline=nyt-org], and Starwood Waypoint Homes[http://www.nytimes.com/topic/company/starwood-waypoint-residential-trust?inline=nyt-org] said they would combine to create an entity with about 82,000 homes in more than a dozen big markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal could set the stage for other institutional investors to join forces. With fewer opportunities to buy homes at a discount, the keys to growth will be reducing operating costs, gaining market share and potentially increasing rent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With consolidation, Wall Street-backed firms’ once-bold strategy of cleaning up the mess created by the crisis by going to foreclosure[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/f/foreclosures/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] auctions and snapping up hundreds of cheap homes has ended.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street jumped into foreclosed homes reckoning that there would be a fundamental shift in housing, with millions of people losing their houses and becoming renters — at least until they could repair their credit scores[http://topics.nytimes.com/your-money/credit/credit-scores/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the eve of the crisis, the rate of homeownership — the percentage of households that own a home — hovered around 69 percent. Today, it is 63.7 percent, according to the <span class="companylink">United States Census Bureau</span>. And last year, the number of new renters again outpaced the number of new homeowners, according to Harvard University’s Joint Center for Housing Studies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the economics of buying recently foreclosed homes to rent out have become more challenging for Wall Street firms that seek to generate double-digit returns for investors, and for publicly traded real estate investment trusts that promise shareholders hefty quarterly dividends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the past year or so, many institutional investors have had to compete with potential homeowners shopping for foreclosed homes posted for sale on multiple listing services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“As home prices rise, most of the institutional investors are dramatically slowing the rate at which they buy new homes,” said Laurie Goodman, director of the Urban Institute’s Housing Finance Policy Center. “And with the easy money days behind them, they need a more efficient cost structure.” She said the merger was a way accomplish that by gaining further economies of scale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> was one of the first private equity firms to begin buying foreclosed homes in the wake of the financial crisis, fixing them up and renting them out. The firm, which began buying homes in earnest in 2011, is estimated to have spent $10 billion on its foreclosed-home-to-rental bet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Invitation Homes</span>, which emerged from that push with almost 50,000 homes, is a company that <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> built from scratch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchases by <span class="companylink">Invitation Homes</span> have dropped sharply since 2013, when it was buying hundreds of homes each week. Its acquisitions are down more than 90 percent from then, and the period of “hyper growth” for the industry has passed, said a person close to the company who was not authorized to speak publicly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all, institutional investors have bought an estimated 200,000 single-family homes to operate as rentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that is a fraction of the overall number of rental homes in the United States. According to housing industry estimates, there are as many as 17 million single-family rentals across the country, most owned by mom-and-pop landlords or firms operating fewer than 100 such homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the crisis, there were about 10 million rental homes, an indication of how many homeowners were displaced by the worst housing crisis since the Great Depression[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/g/great_depression_1930s/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consolidation among institutional investors began three years ago with <span class="companylink">American Homes 4 Rent</span>, which owns 49,000 rental homes, buying <span class="companylink">Beazer Pre-Owned Rental Homes</span>. A few months later, Starwood Waypoint bought <span class="companylink">Colony American Homes</span> in an all-stock deal that valued Colony American at $1.5 billion. Most of the mergers since then have been small, and the deal between Invitation Homes and Starwood Waypoint would be the biggest in an industry that did not exist a decade ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move by institutional investors into the housing market has been credited by some with helping to stabilize the sharp and steady decline in home prices early in the financial crisis. The presence of private equity firms and hedge funds in the market also helped attract the interest of smaller investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But big firms like Invitation Homes and American Homes have drawn criticism from housing advocates for renting their homes at prices that are unaffordable for the working poor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few renters with federal rent subsidies known as Section 8 live in homes owned by <span class="companylink">Invitation Homes</span> and other institutional investors. That is partly because such investors have tended to operate in largely suburban communities and have avoided buying homes in urban areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past, <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> has said that 72 percent of houses owned by <span class="companylink">Invitation Homes</span> have monthly rents within federal affordability guidelines for the markets where it operates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, housing advocates and some legislators criticized <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, one of two government-controlled mortgage finance giants, for agreeing to guarantee a $1 billion financing deal for <span class="companylink">Invitation Homes</span> without getting any assurances that the company would do more to provide affordable housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kevin Stein, a lawyer and deputy director of the California Reinvestment Coalition, a group that supports the rights of tenants and homeowners, said he was concerned that the merger of Invitation Homes and Starwood Waypoint would increase their power to raise rents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What is the level of concentration? This is a concern to our members,” Mr. Stein said. “There are so many communities in California where people are being driven out because of housing costs, and this is part of the dynamic.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the terms of the deal announced on Thursday, each Starwood Waypoint share will be converted into 1.614 <span class="companylink">Invitation Homes</span> shares. The total enterprise value of the combined company, including debt, would be $20 billion, the companies said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Invitation Homes</span>’ shareholders will own roughly 59 percent of the combined company’s stock, while Starwood Waypoint’s investors will own the rest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Blackstone</span>, which took <span class="companylink">Invitation Homes</span> public in January in an offering that raised $1.7 billion in net proceeds, would continue to have a stake in the combined company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the merger, which is subject to the approval of shareholders, is completed, John Bartling, Invitation Homes’ chief executive, will step down. Fred Tuomi, the current chief executive of Starwood Waypoint, will be the chief executive of the combined company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new company’s 11-member board will include six members of the <span class="companylink">Invitation Homes</span> board, including the chairman, Bryce Blair, who will be chairman of the new company’s board. Jonathan D. Gray, head of global real estate for <span class="companylink">Blackstone</span> and an architect of its single-family rental trade, also will be on the board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The combined company will operate as <span class="companylink">Invitation Homes</span> and trade under the <span class="companylink">Invitation Homes</span> ticker symbol.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a day when a nervous stock market declined, shares of both Invitation Homes and Starwood Waypoint surged. <span class="companylink">Invitation Homes</span>’ shares gained 3.91 percent; Starwood Waypoint’s shares rose 5.15 percent.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday at 8:30 a.m., the Commerce Department is set to release data on personal income and consumption in April. Economists on Wall Street are looking for a 0.4 percent increase in both measures, which would be in line with a steadily growing economy. If the figures turn out to be weaker than expected, it may be a sign that the expected rebound in overall growth in the second quarter of 2017 is faltering. Nelson D. Schwartz</p>

Watch for the result of a vote on a shareholder resolution calling for the company to ''stress test'' its business in line with the two degrees Celsius warming target (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) laid out in the Paris climate agreement. <span class="companylink">ExxonMobil</span> supports the Paris deal. A similar measure gained 38 percent support last year. This year, institutional investors like <span class="companylink">BlackRock</span> and Vanguard are considering throwing their support to the proposal, The Wall Street Journal has reported. The vote is not binding, but could put pressure on the company to take a harder look at climate issues. John Schwartz</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When automakers report new-car sales for May on Thursday, investors and economists will watch closely for signs of further erosion in the market. Sales had been on the rise since 2010, but declined in the first four months of this year. <span class="companylink">Edmunds.com</span> is predicting a flat month, with sales of about 1.53 million cars and light trucks, but notes that manufacturers have been pumping sales with incentives. Other major indicators, like rising dealer inventories and declining prices for used cars, provide reasons to believe that a seven-year streak has run out of gas. Neal E. Boudette</p>

Construction is a good barometer for total economic growth, so as with other data this week, economists will look to see what the new figures say about the economy's larger trajectory in the second quarter.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts expect a continuation of job creation's steady pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday at 8:30 a.m., the Labor Department is to release its report on the nation's hiring and unemployment for May. Wall Street analysts expect that payrolls will have grown by 176,000 workers and that the jobless rate will remain flat at 4.4 percent, its lowest level in more than a decade. That steady pace of job creation should be sufficient evidence of the kind of stronger economic growth that members of the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> said they were searching for before raising the benchmark interest rate when they meet in mid-June. At this point, wage increases are a more important indicator of the labor market's health than the unemployment figure. Economists expect the average hourly wage to climb by 0.3 percent, nudging up the year-over-year increase to 2.7 percent. Patricia Cohen</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SEATTLE — It’s one of the oldest tricks in an internet company’s playbook. Concoct a tool that gives the public new statistics on something — the quality of a restaurant or a toaster, say. Then watch visitors flock to the data and worry about accuracy later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few such tools have been as controversial as ones that show people the market value of homes, using software algorithms to do the estimates. Homes are typically the most valuable asset in people’s lives, so emotions run hot when these estimates are seen as too high or too low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The best known of these tools — the Zestimate, from the online real estate website Zillow — began on the internet 11 years ago and has since amassed a huge audience of homeowners, shoppers and nosy neighbors. Sellers say unfair Zestimates can kill offers on their homes. About 171 million people visit Zillow each month, according to the company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news is that the overall accuracy of these home estimates appears to have improved significantly over time. But they still have meaningful error rates compared with actual home sale prices. That means that they really shouldn’t be used as more than a conversation point between homeowners, shoppers and their real estate agents when they’re coming up with listing prices and offers for homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Zillow has an idea to make them better. On Wednesday, it plans to announce the Zillow Prize, a $1 million award that will go to the individual or team that can most improve the Zestimate algorithm. The contest was inspired partly by a similar competition at <span class="companylink">Netflix</span>, which awarded $1 million in 2009 to a group of programmers and statisticians who best improved the company’s movie recommendation technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Zestimates[https://www.zillow.com/zestimate/] currently use a variety of data, including a home’s square footage, location, tax assessments and comparable recent sales of homes in the area. Banks and insurance companies have used software to value real estate for years through what are called automated valuation models. Zillow was simply the first to get mainstream awareness for its estimates by making them available to the public online.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first, the Zestimates were pretty dubious. When Zillow started out in 2006 with 43 million homes listed, it calculated the median error rate across the site at about 14 percent, said Stan Humphries, the chief economist of Zillow. That means half were within 14 percent of final sale prices for homes, while those for the other half of homes were off by more than 14 percent — a big discrepancy for the real estate business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through refinement of its algorithms and better data about homes, Zillow, now with 110 million homes accessible on the site, has a median error rate of around 5 percent, Mr. Humphries said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even that still adds up. In a place like San Francisco, with a median home price of $1.1 million, being off on a home estimate by more than 5 percent means missing the final price by more than $55,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Zestimates can be amusing for curious homeowners, they are infuriating for others. Barbara Andersen bought a home in Glenview, Ill., in 2009 with a view of a golf course for about $630,000. She wants to sell the home for about that amount, but the Zestimate on it is now about $536,000, which she believes is too low and has deterred buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Andersen, a real estate lawyer, filed a lawsuit[http://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Zillow.pdf] against Zillow this year, accusing the company of conducting stealth home appraisals without a state license. In recent days, she has represented several plaintiffs in a similar lawsuit[http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-zillow-class-action-0523-biz-20170523-story.html] filed in Cook County Circuit Court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If it’s not reliable, you shouldn’t put it out there,” she said in a phone interview, referring to Zestimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zillow said that the lawsuits are without merit and that Illinois law doesn’t count computer-generated estimating tools as appraisals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most real estate agents grumble about online home estimates, too. Redfin, an internet real estate firm in Seattle, introduced its own home value estimator less than two years ago, commissioning an independent study[http://press.redfin.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=252734&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=2241516] that showed its figures were more accurate than Zillow’s (Zillow disputes its conclusions).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike Zillow, Redfin is a real estate brokerage, employing agents to buy and sell homes for clients, which means that its chief executive, Glenn Kelman, regularly hears from Redfin agents who either love its estimating tool or despise it. The latter would rather have a conversation about home values without the Redfin estimator having colored clients’ expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I’ve almost never talked to our field organization without having to address the estimate,” Mr. Kelman said. “It’s a very personal and emotional thing.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There’s little chance that home value estimation tools will ever eliminate their error rates entirely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Susan Athey, an economist who is a professor at Stanford University, said she’s impressed with Zillow’s 5 percent median error rate for something as variable as homes. She said information like Zestimates are valuable for making a market like real estate function more smoothly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If individuals do not understand the market value of their property, they may pass over offers, making both buyers and sellers worse off,” Ms. Athey said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as they improve, it makes more sense to look at internet home estimates the way we look at <span class="companylink">Yelp</span> reviews of a restaurant — helpful, but hardly the final word.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is still no consensus on why the last housing boom and bust happened. That is troubling, because that violent housing cycle helped to produce the Great Recession and financial crisis of 2007 to 2009. We need to understand it all if we are going to be able to avoid ordeals like that in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the explanations for what happened in housing are not, I think, to be found in the conventional data favored by economists but rather in sociologically important narratives -- like tales of getting rich through ''flipping'' houses and shares of initial public offerings -- that constitute the shifting mentality of the era.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider the data for a moment. It shows us that extreme changes took place but doesn't tell us why.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real home prices rose 75 percent from February 1997 to December 2005, according to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, corrected for inflation by the Consumer Price Index. And then, from 2005 to 2012, real prices reversed course, falling to just 12 percent above their 1997 level. In the years since 2012, they have climbed 29 percent, about halfway back to their 2005 peak. This is a roller coaster in national home prices -- it has been even scarier in some more volatile cities -- yet we have no clarity on why it happened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem for economists is that these changes don't correspond to movements in the usual suspects: interest rates, building costs, population or rents. The Consumer Price Index for Rent of Primary Residence, compiled by the <span class="companylink">United States Bureau of Labor Statistics</span> and corrected for inflation, went up only 8 percent in 1997 to 2005, so unmet demand for housing services can't explain the huge increase in real home prices. It doesn't explain the 29 percent rise in real home prices since 2012 either, because inflation-adjusted rents increased only 10 percent in that period. So what has been driving the wild ride in home prices?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I believe the price swings have something to do with the changing mentality of the times, changes caused by narratives that have gone viral and swept across the population. Looking for answers in such popular stories contrasts starkly with the prominent approach of modeling people as though they react logically to economic forces. But a less orthodox approach can be quite useful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One thing is clear: The prevalent narratives of 1997 to 2005 did not include the concept of a housing bubble, not at first. A computer search using ProQuest or Google Ngrams shows that the phrase ''housing bubble'' was hardly used until 2005, the end of the boom. What is a bubble? It typically includes the notion that, spurred by the public's expectation of ever further price increases, demand eventually reaches levels that cannot be sustained, and so the enthusiasm wanes and the bubble collapses. But that thought was just not on many people's minds then, the evidence suggests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, during the 1997 to 2005 boom there were multitudes of narratives about smart investors who were bold enough to take a position in the market. To single out one strand, recall the stories of flippers who would buy a house, fix it up, and resell it within months at a huge profit. These stories appear to have been broadly exciting to people who didn't flip houses themselves but who appear to have begun to think that stretching a little and buying a house with a large mortgage would make them wise investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his book ''The Complete Guide to Flipping Properties,'' published in 2004, Steve Berges extolled what he called ''the O.P.M. principle,'' meaning ''other people's money.'' He wrote, ''Your objective is to control as much real estate as possible while using as little of your own capital as possible.'' In other words, borrow as much as you can. He wrote about the upside of leverage but not about the perils of leverage during the kind of big price drops that were just around the corner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It can take a long time for narratives like this to grip the popular imagination. Flipping was ''a thing'' in the condominium conversion boom of the 1970s and '80s. The idea then was this: Big-time converters with deep pockets would buy apartment buildings and convert the rental apartments to owner-occupied condos, selling units to diverse individuals, some of them flippers. For public relations purposes, converters would offer to sell at reduced prices to renters already living in a building, and typically to some outsiders, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This generated buzz. When renters and speculators flipped their purchase contracts at a big profit, sometimes using borrowed money for down payments to flip multiple units without actually even closing on the condos, it was thrilling. It seemed that anyone with energy and initiative could get rich doing this.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some people eager to make quick profits bought Donald J. Trump's well-timed 2004 book, ''Trump: Think Like a Billionaire: Everything You Need to Know About Success, Real Estate, and Life,'' written with Meredith McIver. Some enrolled in the less well-timed Trump University, which emphasized real estate investment in 2005, at the very end of the housing boom; it shut down, amid lawsuits and recrimination, in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Narratives about flipping weren't restricted to real estate. Just after the time of the condo boom, stories of rapid buying and selling of initial public offerings took off as well. As with the condo promoters, I.P.O. underwriters would sell some shares below market prices to customers, who might then flip the I.P.O. for a quick profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The promoters of condo conversions and I.P.O.s were onto something. By giving discounts to buyers who would make a high return, they captivated the nation with tales of people who had no advanced degrees or hefty résumés but made fortunes anyway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By now, the notion of getting rich by flipping houses is entrenched. I searched <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> for books on ''flipping houses'' and came up with 328 hits, most written in the past few years. Buying and rehabbing existing houses for resale is a legitimate business. But many of these books make extravagant pitches and seem aimed at inspiring amateurs to plunge into risky ventures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The public fascination with speculating in housing has been held in check by regulators empowered by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, but that restraint is tenuous with the election as president of a real estate promoter intent on reducing regulators' power. These narratives are still potent and could easily spur further spirals in the housing market.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's a look at what's coming up this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ECONOMY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction in April is expected to show strength.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home and condominium construction slipped in March, but many economists think that was partly because of bad winter weather that delayed projects. The residential construction market is up for the year and contributed to economic growth in the first quarter. Economists expect that trend to continue when the data on April housing starts is released on Tuesday. Conor Dougherty</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A rise in industrial production is forecast for April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday morning, the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> will release data on industrial production in April. Buoyed by stronger demand for products from overseas customers and a recovering domestic energy sector, manufacturing has been healthy this year, and economists are looking for a 0.4 percent increase in industrial production for the month. Some experts, including those at <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>, suggest that the rise may be bigger, especially in light of healthy hiring and an uptick in auto production despite softer car sales.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shareholders will gather for <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span>'s annual meeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span> shareholders will gather on Tuesday in Wilmington, Del., for the bank's annual meeting. The agenda is relatively noncontroversial this year, though the meeting could be a chance for the bank's chief executive, Jamie Dimon, to weigh in on the discussions brewing in the Trump administration about breaking up the biggest banks and bringing back a version of the Glass-Steagall Act, as well as other regulatory issues facing the financial sector and broader economy. Michael Corkery</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Puerto Rican officials will meet with creditors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Puerto Rican officials will meet the island's many creditors in court in San Juan on Wednesday to start the process of restructuring its debt. It is the first meeting with creditors since the island sought bankruptcy-like protection under Title III of a new law informally known as Promesa. Congress enacted the law last year because Puerto Rico needed a methodical way to adjust its $123 billion in bond debt and unfunded pension obligations, but is legally barred from the usual route taken by insolvent local governments, Chapter 9 bankruptcy. The Title III proceedings have already stayed previous creditor lawsuits so the various parties can come together in a consolidated case. Mary Williams Walsh</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Artificial intelligence is likely to dominate <span class="companylink">Google</span>'s festival.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Google</span> will hold its annual developers' conference in Silicon Valley on Wednesday, an extravaganza in a campus amphitheater that is staged like a rock concert. This year's show is likely to focus on how artificial intelligence is being integrated into <span class="companylink">Google</span> products like Google Home, the smart speaker controlled by voice commands, which was introduced last year. <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> dominates this nascent market, which <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> has just entered as well.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Bank of Mexico</span> is expected to raise interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With inflation running at the highest rate in eight years, <span class="companylink">Mexico's central bank</span> is expected to raise interest rates at its monetary policy meeting on Thursday. The <span class="companylink">Bank of Mexico</span> has been steadily raising interest rates over the past 18 months, and its governor, Agustín Carstens, said recently that there was room for additional tightening. Inflation figures in April showed an annual rate of almost 6 percent, driven in part by price spikes for several basic foods, including tomatoes and avocados. But there is less pressure from rising prices for imports because the Mexican peso, which dropped to a record low after the election of President Trump, has recovered and appears to have stabilized.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHANGHAI — Until it became the subject of China’s latest property-buying frenzy, sending shares of construction companies soaring and leading the authorities to close local real estate offices, the area around Xiongxian County was known primarily for its donkey burgers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The residential and industrial area roughly 80 miles south of Beijing barely registers on China’s economic map. It consists mostly of apartment buildings, villages, wetlands and more than a few empty fields.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But on Saturday, China declared that an area that sprawls across three local counties will someday become Xiongan New Area, a gleaming economic powerhouse reminiscent of earlier developments that helped put China’s economy on its fast-growth trajectory. When completed, it will cover nearly 800 square miles, offer favorable regulation to businesses and become a modern urban area key to redeveloping the Rust Belt around Beijing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Xi Jinping, China’s president, as quoted by official Chinese news media, Xiongan will become “a demonstration area for innovative development.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, it has become the latest example of the frothiness and unpredictability of the Chinese property market — a market that many experts warn could have severe repercussions for China and the world if it stumbles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local Chinese officials have moved to freeze purchases and make other moves to cool the local market, according to local real estate agents and news media reports. Chinese social media showed photos of new property developments and real-estate offices with signs saying they had been temporarily closed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the town of Baigou, about 12 miles north of Xiongxian, prices for an apartment jumped to 12,000 renminbi per square meter — or more than $160 per square foot — from 8,750 renminbi within hours after the announcement, according to Wen Yunlong, a local real estate agency. On Sunday, it rose by another 3,000 renminbi, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Prices have gone up every day,” Mr. Wen said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since Saturday, he said, potential buyers had lined up at his agency. “I have been working from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. these days,” he said. “Last night, I worked till midnight.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added: “I haven’t seen so many people here before. It went crazy.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, shares of the <span class="companylink">BBMG Corporation</span>, a Beijing cement maker, saw its Hong Kong-traded shares jump nearly 35 percent. Other Hong Kong-traded property-related firms active in the area saw their shares rise by smaller amounts. Markets in China were closed on Monday for a holiday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property is a major investment vehicle in China, where the stock market has long been seen as unreliable[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/27/business/international/chinese-stock-indexes-plunge.html] and where the authorities tightly limit how much money can be sent outside the country. That has led to surging prices — and worries about bubbles — in a number of cities. While mortgages in China are not as big or as common as they are in the United States, a surge of lending[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/17/business/international/china-home-price-bubble.html] to home buyers has prompted worries about what might happen if China’s property market bursts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In declaring its intent to build Xiongan, the Chinese government invited comparisons to the southern city of Shenzhen and Shanghai’s Pudong area. Shenzhen was part of China’s earliest experiments with private enterprise after the death of Mao Zedong, and it remains one of the richest parts of China. Pudong, home of many of the gleaming skyscrapers that define Shanghai’s skyline, became one of China’s most successful and high-profile development projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Xiongan also fits into China’s grand plan to create a vast urban area uniting the capital city of Beijing with the nearby port city of Tianjin and with Hebei province, the industrial province between them. Called Jing-Jin-Ji[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/20/world/asia/in-china-a-supercity-rises-around-beijing.html], the area — which would include Xiongan — will become a hive of economic activity that is intended to replace Hebei’s dependence on smokestack industries like steel and put the region on a path to rival Shanghai and Shenzhen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right now, the Xiongan area has less than 1 percent of the economic output of Beijing, according to state media. It is part of an area known for its donkey burgers — sandwiches with roasted donkey meat that tastes something like pastrami.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Owen Li took the morning train on Monday from Beijing to sample donkey burgers but had an unusually hard time buying a ticket. Once in Baigou, where property sales had not been shut down, Mr. Li noticed that many cars on the street were brands like <span class="companylink">Audi</span>, <span class="companylink">BMW</span> and <span class="companylink">Mercedes-Benz</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He then met many potential apartment buyers from out of town and began talking to them. Mr. Li said he was tempted to join them, though he wondered at Xiongan’s long-term prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If I had the extra money, I would buy several,” he said. “It’s cheap and has room for appreciation. But maybe not this time.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate market temperatures in the commuter suburbs around New York City[http://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/17/realestate/how-to-pick-the-right-new-york-city-suburb.html] range from warm to sizzling, having never really cooled down for the winter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As 2016 ended, prices remained stable, but most markets showed rising sales volume and a dwindling supply of homes for sale. Now, on the cusp of spring, any slack left over from the financial crisis is largely gone, with the exception of an oversupply of luxury homes at the very top.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Westchester[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/classifieds/realestate/locations/newyork/westchester/?inline=nyt-geo] and Fairfield Counties, “I wouldn’t characterize anywhere as dead or nonactive,” said Jim Gricar, the general sales manager for Houlihan Lawrence. “Two years ago, I couldn’t have said that. But today, I feel confident saying it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Long Island[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/classifieds/realestate/locations/newyork/longisland/?inline=nyt-geo], in both Suffolk and Nassau Counties, the housing markets are moving at a “blistering pace,” and prices are accelerating, according to a fourth-quarter market report from <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman Real Estate</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in the inner-ring New Jersey[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/classifieds/realestate/locations/newjersey/?inline=nyt-geo] suburbs closest to Manhattan[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/classifieds/realestate/locations/newyork/newyorkcity/manhattan/?inline=nyt-geo], the markets are so brisk that many have less than three months’ worth of inventory, according to Jeffrey Otteau, the president of the Otteau Group[https://www.otteau.com/], an appraisal and advisory firm. By way of comparison, in 2012, most of those markets had a four-to-eight-month supply, a more typical range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dynamics driving demand vary from suburb to suburb, but industry experts cited several overall reasons for the busy winter. First, many buyers had been holding off on making a purchase until after the presidential election, largely because of uncertainty about the outcome. That pent-up demand was unleashed after Nov. 8, and has been helped along by a mild winter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Anecdotally, the brokerage community said literally the day after the election there was a pop — activity jumped,” said Jonathan Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel[http://www.millersamuel.com/], which prepares the <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span> market reports. “We saw the same thing after the 2012 election. When the numbers come in for the first quarter, I think we will see an uptick over a year ago.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, buyers priced out of New York continue to be on a quest for affordability, a phenomenon common to many high-priced metropolitan areas around the country, Mr. Miller said. Many of those buyers bring a city mind-set[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/16/realestate/the-new-suburbia-more-urban.html] to their hunt in the suburbs, driving competition in areas with in-town living, lively and walkable downtowns and commuter rail service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then there was “the real noise” that began toward the end of last year about the likelihood of rising interest rates this year, Mr. Gricar said, adding, “Buyers decided to get to work.” The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> announced on Wednesday that it would raise its benchmark interest rate, which will likely mean a rise in mortgage rates. A 30-year fixed rate currently averages just above 4 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, 2017 “started out with a bang” for sellers in the Mount Pleasant and Ossining areas, said Susan Strawgate Code, an associate broker in the Briarcliff Manor office of Houlihan Lawrence. Take Pleasantville, a village in Mount Pleasant popular with New York City buyers because of its quick commute to Manhattan and its Brooklynesque feel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Over the last six months, the average days-on-market in Pleasantville before going to contract was only 83 days,” Ms. Code said. “That’s a pretty quick turnaround.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventory is so low — just 34 homes were on the market as of last week — that buyers are waiting in the wings for new listings to come on, she said. And multiple bids are common.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Westchester as a whole, the absorption rate — the number of months it would take to sell all active listings based on the pace of sales — was 3.7 months in the last quarter of 2016, the fastest pace since 2001, according to <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>. The overall median sales price rose by a modest 3 percent compared with a year earlier, though increases were greater in the White Plains and lower Westchester markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Long Island, sales have been so brisk over the past couple of years that inventory is at its lowest level in 13 years, Elliman reported. As a result, prices are accelerating more quickly than in other metropolitan-area markets, especially in Nassau County, which had a median sale price increase of about 7 percent last quarter compared with a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New Jersey, price growth has been very modest across the state as a whole, even as sales volume grew by 12 percent last year. But appreciation is much more robust in the economically strong commuter suburbs closest to the city, such as Jersey City, Hoboken, Glen Ridge and Ridgewood, according to Mr. Otteau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He noted that January brought an unusual statewide spike in sales of homes priced between $1 million and $2.5 million, a market segment that had slowed in recent years. While the 19 percent year-over-year surge might be an anomaly, Mr. Otteau said, it could also be a sign that high-income buyers are feeling extra confident, possibly because of the Trump administration’s talk of financial deregulation and tax reform.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s completely opposite to what we’d been seeing previously,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the market above $2 million remains soft throughout the suburbs. In Fairfield County, Conn., for example, the median price for the top 10 percent of sales dropped by more than 15 percent in the last quarter of 2016 to $1.7 million, due primarily to a shift toward lower-priced sales, according to Elliman. (The median sale price for the county as a whole declined by 3 percent, to $372,000.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Greenwich, Conn., where the median single-family sale price is around $1.6 million, the sluggish high-end market is contributing to concerns among some agents and business people that the town might have a perception problem. Sabine H. Schoenberg, the chief executive of Prime Sites, said that derogatory comments about the Greenwich housing market made publicly last fall by Barry Sternlicht[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-13/starwood-s-sternlicht-says-greenwich-is-worst-u-s-housing-market], the chairman and chief executive of Starwood Capital Group, were one of the first things buyers saw when researching the town on the internet. (Mr. Sternlicht, who had been frustrated in his efforts to sell his Greenwich mansion, claimed the market was so bad “you can’t give away” a home.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Schoenberg and other members of a Greenwich economic advisory council are pushing the town to help fund a public relations campaign that would promote its positive attributes as a counterpoint to the negative perceptions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A similar effort is happening in the small town of Weston, Conn., where some residents are frustrated that the town “isn’t getting the attention it should from potential home buyers,” said Bill Douglass, who is helping to craft the campaign. Without rail service or a downtown, Weston has lost some buyer appeal in recent years. A new website, the Weston Way[http://thewestonway.com/], promotes the town’s two-acre zoning, abundance of nature and high-performing schools as part of an effort to put Weston “in a proper context,” Mr. Douglass said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Say you’re thinking of moving from Brooklyn[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/classifieds/realestate/locations/newyork/newyorkcity/brooklyn/?inline=nyt-geo], and you like farmers’ markets, fresh food,” Mr. Douglass said. “Here, you could have your own chicken coops, and maybe have a farmers’ market just a short drive away.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While such campaigns may attract some buyers to communities they hadn’t considered, they won’t change market realities, Mr. Miller noted. It is up to agents to educate sellers about what their homes are really worth, especially at the high end of the market, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s not that demand for the high end has waned,” he said. “It’s that the value map has changed. And buyers are not looking to pay 2014 prices in 2017.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Manhattan[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/classifieds/realestate/locations/newyork/newyorkcity/manhattan/?inline=nyt-geo] luxury market saw a flow of activity in townhouses last month, and topping the list of sales was a grand limestone mansion near Central Park that was owned for nearly a decade by the real estate investor Andrew L. Farkas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The five-story, 22½-foot-wide house, at 12 East 73rd Street off Fifth Avenue, sold for $41,000,000[https://a836-acris.nyc.gov/DS/DocumentSearch/DocumentDetail?doc_id=2017020201635001], according to property records. It was the most expensive closed sale in February and one of the city’s priciest townhouse transactions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the other townhome sales last month included purchases on the Upper East Side by Craig Filipacchi[http://www.bhsusa.com/real-estate-agent/craig-filipacchi], a prolific real estate broker with Brown Harris Stevens, and in Chelsea by the fashion stylist Karl Templer[http://www.karltempler.com/editorial].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other notable closed sales, the comedians Samantha Bee and her husband, Jason Jones, bought an apartment on the Upper West Side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Farkas, who is the founder and chief executive of the Island Capital Group[https://www.islecap.com/], a real estate merchant bank, made a tidy profit on his Upper East Side house, which he had listed last year for $42.5 million. He bought the townhouse — once home to the French high school Lycée Français de New York — in April 2007 for $23 million[https://a836-acris.nyc.gov/DS/DocumentSearch/DocumentDetail?doc_id=2007042500784001] from the private equity investor J. Christopher Flowers. (Just months before, Mr. Flowers had purchased the Harkness Mansion on East 75th Street for $53 million[https://a836-acris.nyc.gov/DS/DocumentSearch/DocumentDetail?doc_id=2006100900900001], which is still a townhouse record.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home underwent a top-to-bottom renovation that transformed the 10,400-square-foot space into a showplace with five bedrooms, five full baths and three powder rooms, along with formal dining and living rooms, a bar-club room, gym and massage room, among the dozen or so spacious rooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are also nine fireplaces and three kitchens, including one on the landscaped roof terrace, according to the listing[http://www.corcoran.com/nyc/Listings/Display/3693386] with <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>. Other outdoor space includes a 500-square-foot south-facing garden and a terrace off the full-floor master suite.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The listing agents, who were part of the Cathy Franklin and Deborah Grubman teams, declined to comment on the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Farkas, whose family owned the Alexander’s department store chain, sold the house through the limited liability company 12 VQ, and it was purchased by 12E73rd LLC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few blocks away at 58 East 66th Street is another striking limestone mansion. It was acquired by Mr. Filipacchi, who specializes in selling high-end properties, and Tara Wilkinson. The price was $24.18 million[https://a836-acris.nyc.gov/DS/DocumentSearch/DocumentDetail?doc_id=2017021500187003], according to property records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The five-story house, also fully restored and similarly configured, has six bedrooms and five fireplaces within its 9,600 square feet, according to the Corcoran listing[http://www.corcoran.com/nyc/Listings/Display/3481008]. There is ample outdoor space, too, which includes a roof deck, rear garden and two terraces. The seller’s identity was shielded by a limited liability company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Templer’s townhouse, at 348 West 22nd Street, near Ninth Avenue, was more modest in size and price. However, it will likely need some work, along with Mr. Templer’s styling chops, to restore it to its original grandeur. It sold for $8 million[https://a836-acris.nyc.gov/DS/DocumentSearch/DocumentDetail?doc_id=2017021000521001].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 21-foot-wide Greek Revival-style brick house was built in the early 1840s on a site that once served as home to Clement Clarke Moore, the author of the poem “’Twas the Night Before Christmas.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home has around 4,300 square feet over four stories that is currently configured as an upper triplex with two first-floor studios, according to the listing[https://lesliegarfield.com/properties/new-york/sale/348-west-22nd-street] with the brokerage firm Leslie J. Garfield.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Templer’s work as a stylist has appeared in several publications, including the international editions of Vogue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Bee and Mr. Jones paid $3.7 million[https://a836-acris.nyc.gov/DS/DocumentSearch/DocumentDetail?doc_id=2016081700813001] for unit 14EF at 300 Riverside Drive, a brick and limestone co-op building at West 102nd Street.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suppose there were a way to pump up the economy, reduce inequality and put an end to destructive housing bubbles like the one that contributed to the Great Recession. The idea would be simple, but not easy, requiring a wholesale reframing of the United States economy and housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The solution: Americans, together and all at once, would have to stop thinking about their homes as an investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The virtues of homeownership are so ingrained in the American psyche that we often forget that housing is also a source of economic stress. Rising milk prices are regarded as a household tragedy for some, and spiking gas prices stoke national outrage. But whenever home prices go up, it's ''a recovery,'' even though that recovery also means millions of people can no longer afford to buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes are the largest asset for all but the richest households, but shelter is also a basic necessity, like food. We have a variety of state and federal programs devised to make housing cheaper and more accessible, and a maze of local land-use laws that make housing scarcer and more expensive by doing things like prohibiting in-law units, regulating how small lots can be, and capping the number of unrelated people who can live together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another big problem: High rent and home prices prevent Americans from moving to cities where jobs and wages are booming. That hampers economic growth, makes income inequality worse and keeps people from pursuing their dreams.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So instead of looking at homes as investments, what if we regarded them like a TV or a car or any other consumer good? People might expect home prices to go down instead of up. Homebuilders would probably spend more time talking about technology and design than financing options. Politicians might start talking about their plans to lower home prices further, as they often do with fuel prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this thought experiment, housing prices would probably adjust. They would be somewhat cheaper in most places, where population is growing slowly. But they would be profoundly cheaper in places like super-expensive San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was the conclusion of a recent paper by the economists Ed Glaeser of Harvard and Joe Gyourko at the <span class="companylink">Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania</span>. The paper uses construction industry data to determine how much a house should cost to build if land-use regulation were drastically cut back. Since the cost of erecting a home varies little from state to state -- land is the main variable in housing costs -- their measure is the closest thing we have to a national home price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to them, a standard American home should cost around $200,000, a figure that includes the cost of construction, what land would cost in a lightly regulated market, and a modest profit for developers. In many places, that's what the prices roughly are. But for a few metropolitan areas like San Francisco and Boston, homes are wildly overpriced, leading to distortions in the economy and labor market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We would still see homes of different sizes and styles -- condos in some places, single-family homes in others -- depending on the market in each city. A New York home would be smaller than one in, say, Houston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And prices would still vary from place to place, based on demand and geography. It's easier to build in Phoenix (plenty of flat land), and harder in San Francisco (lots of hills and nearby water). But while building in the San Francisco metro area is more expensive than in other places, it's not that expensive. By the paper's calculations, a home in the San Francisco area should cost around $281,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The actual price for a standard home in the area is more like $800,000 (using 2013 data). The paper argues that most of that difference is caused by regulatory hurdles like design and environmental reviews that can add years to a project's timeline and suppress the overall housing supply. The result is overpayment on a grand scale for the few homes that do get built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People are sure to quibble with the economists' calculations, but their general conclusion -- that an abundance of new homes would result in lower prices -- is not remotely controversial. Many studies, from the <span class="companylink">McKinsey Global Institute</span>, California's Legislative Analyst's Office and others, have shown that California's high home prices are largely a supply problem: The state doesn't build enough homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are counterexamples around the world. Tokyo has not had rapid home price appreciation because increases in demand are met with increases in new building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So let's carry on with this hypothetical. Say we opened the floodgate of development. What kind of effects could we expect? The economy would grow, and by a lot. According to a recent paper by the economists Chang-Tai Hsieh, from the <span class="companylink">University of Chicago's Booth School of Business</span>, and Enrico Moretti, from the <span class="companylink">University of California, Berkeley</span>, local land-use regulations reduce the United States' economic output by as much as $1.5 trillion a year, or about 10 percent lower than it could be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is a theoretical figure that includes easy-to-see things like increased sales of building materials and more jobs for construction workers. Most of the increase, however, would come from more abstract gains like increased wages for people who are willing to move from an economically distressed city to a faster-growing economy elsewhere, but are currently unable to because housing is too expensive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over time, the accelerated pace of building could lead to a long-run deflation in home values. But for the most part that would be limited to a few coastal cities. And while the older homeowners there would most likely be resentful of all the new apartments, condos and townhomes that caused their home equity to shrivel, younger people would have an easier time getting started.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, it's likely that lower home prices would encourage workers to move farther and more often in search of job opportunities. The impact on mobility could be huge, as the $1.5 trillion figure shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was a time, a few decades ago, when the cost of living did not vary all that much from city to city. Since then, as places like New York, San Francisco and Seattle have been hit with skyrocketing rents and home prices, the regional disparity in housing costs has altered how Americans of different incomes pursue opportunity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back when home prices were more even from place to place, people with different levels of education and income tended to flock to the same types of high-wage places, according to research by Daniel Shoag, a professor of public policy at Harvard, and Peter Ganong of the <span class="companylink">University of Chicago</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, people with less education tend to go where housing is cheap, like Las Vegas, while college-educated workers with skills that are in demand still go to places where wages are high, like the Bay Area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's because lower-income people have little to gain by going to California's coastal cities. Wages might be higher, but as the state's poverty figures show, a better paycheck doesn't help if it's swallowed by rent. The loss of mobility makes income inequality worse, because lower-wage workers are effectively locked out of exactly those places where wages and the demand for workers are greatest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, if housing were plentiful and cheap, we would probably stop having big housing bubbles. One good way of describing a speculative bubble is a moment when society deludes itself into believing that something plentiful is scarce, or will soon be. In the mid-2000s, banks and homeowners came to believe that homes would be scarce in places like Las Vegas and Phoenix, even though there were enough materials, land and labor to keep building and building and building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing is particularly prone to bubbles because, in contrast with other products, we seem to want it more when it is expensive and less when it is cheap. And no matter how many times we look out an airplane window to see vast acres of emptiness, we somehow still believe that land is a great investment because nobody is making more of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes would still hold a lot of value; they still might appreciate, if more slowly; and desirable neighborhoods would still seem relatively expensive. But there would probably be fewer manias in which people expect home prices to double in just a few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as we don't expect to make a profit selling our cars, if we stopped thinking of our homes as big moneymakers, we would probably start focusing on building them faster and less expensively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeff Wilson, a college professor turned entrepreneur who refers to himself as Professor Dumpster for the year he spent living in a metal trash container that he turned into a home, is trying to make this happen on a small scale. Mr. Wilson's nascent company, Kasita, wants to produce a line of one-bedroom homes. They would be identical in size and bought for a single price, and could be placed on city lots that traditional developers are unlikely to be interested in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes would be stacked together, creating de facto apartment buildings that could be built and unbuilt in a few weeks. Although that wouldn't do much to help a family of four, it might take some pressure off the housing market by directing younger people to studios instead of having them pile in together, freeing up some three-bedroom apartments for families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, Americans seem unlikely to embrace this vision on a large scale, and even if they did, it would take a long time to start seeing home prices drop or flatline. But mass-produced homes from the past -- brick townhouses or bungalows that came from a <span class="companylink">Sears</span> catalog -- are now sought after, so this imaginary world needn't be uglier, though it very well may be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, even if homes were a lot cheaper, we would probably retain the societal benefits of homeownership: As Mr. Glaeser and Mr. Gyourko's data shows, housing is already relatively affordable in the vast majority of American cities. So there is little reason to believe that people would desert overpriced neighborhoods if they suddenly became cheaper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This does not mean that select places like New York's West Village or San Francisco's Mission District would suddenly be affordable -- or that American cities would suddenly fill up with towering condominiums and blocks of identical rowhouses. Housing is a regional problem, spread across miles of cities and suburbs, so a lot of new development would probably occur in close-in suburbs where there is more land than people think.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take Boston. The median Boston suburb has a minimum lot size of one acre, and many suburbs have minimum lot sizes of one home per two or four acres. That is a huge drag on the region's overall housing supply, according to Mr. Glaeser.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, our view of homeownership is so entrenched in our economy, our political system and our tax code that it would be impossible to change in a short time, and probably even in a long time.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suppose there were a way to pump up the economy, reduce inequality and put an end to destructive housing bubbles like the one that contributed to the Great Recession. The idea would be simple, but not easy, requiring a wholesale reframing of the United States economy and housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The solution: Americans, together and all at once, would have to stop thinking about their homes as an investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The virtues of homeownership are so ingrained in the American psyche that we often forget[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/23/opinion/23krugman.html] that housing is also a source of economic stress[https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/03/the-rent-really-is-too-damn-high/254718/]. Rising milk prices are regarded as a household tragedy for some, and spiking gas prices stoke national outrage. But whenever home prices go up, it’s “a recovery,” even though that recovery also means millions of people can no longer afford to buy[https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/business/wonk/housing/atlanta/].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes are the largest asset for all but the richest households[http://www.zillow.com/research/affordability-2016q1-12763/], but shelter is also a basic necessity, like food. We have a variety of state and federal programs devised to make housing cheaper and more accessible, and a maze of local land-use laws that make housing scarcer and more expensive by doing things like prohibiting in-law units, regulating how small lots can be, and capping the number of unrelated people who can live together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another big problem: High rent and home prices prevent Americans from moving to cities where jobs and wages are booming. That hampers economic growth, makes income inequality worse and keeps people from pursuing their dreams.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So instead of looking at homes as investments, what if we regarded them like a TV or a car or any other consumer good? People might expect home prices to go down instead of up. Homebuilders would probably spend more time talking about technology and design than financing options. Politicians might start talking about their plans to lower home prices further, as they often do with fuel prices[http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/02/25/10507857-gingrich-im-the-250-gas-president-obama-is-the-10-gas-guy].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this thought experiment, housing prices would probably adjust. They would be somewhat cheaper in most places, where population is growing slowly. But they would be profoundly cheaper in places like super-expensive San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was the conclusion of a recent paper[http://realestate.wharton.upenn.edu/research/papers/full/802.pdf] by the economists Ed Glaeser of Harvard and Joe Gyourko at the <span class="companylink">Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania</span>. The paper uses construction industry data to determine how much a house should cost to build if land-use regulation were drastically cut back. Since the cost of erecting a home varies little from state to state — land is the main variable in housing costs — their measure is the closest thing we have to a national home price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to them, a standard American home should cost around $200,000, a figure that includes the cost of construction, what land would cost in a lightly regulated market, and a modest profit for developers. In many places, that’s what the prices roughly are. But for a few metropolitan areas like San Francisco and Boston, homes are wildly overpriced, leading to distortions in the economy and labor market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We would still see homes of different sizes and styles — condos in some places, single-family homes in others — depending on the market in each city. A New York home would be smaller than one in, say, Houston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And prices would still vary from place to place, based on demand and geography. It’s easier to build in Phoenix (plenty of flat land), and harder in San Francisco (lots of hills and nearby water). But while building in the San Francisco metro area is more expensive than in other places, it’s not that expensive. By the paper’s calculations, a home in the San Francisco area should cost around $281,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The actual price for a standard home in the area is more like $800,000 (using 2013 data). The paper argues that most of that difference is caused by regulatory hurdles like design and environmental reviews that can add years to a project’s timeline and suppress the overall housing supply. The result is overpayment on a grand scale for the few homes that do get built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People are sure to quibble with the economists’ calculations, but their general conclusion — that an abundance of new homes would result in lower prices — is not remotely controversial. Many studies, from the McKinsey Global Institute[http://www.mckinsey.com/global-themes/urbanization/closing-californias-housing-gap], California’s Legislative Analyst’s Office[http://www.lao.ca.gov/Publications/Report/3345] and others, have shown that California’s high home prices are largely a supply problem: The state doesn’t build enough homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are counterexamples around the world. Tokyo has not had rapid home price appreciation because increases in demand are met with increases in new building[https://www.ft.com/content/023562e2-54a6-11e6-befd-2fc0c26b3c60].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So let’s carry on with this hypothetical. Say we opened the floodgate of development. What kind of effects could we expect? The economy would grow, and by a lot. According to a recent paper[http://eml.berkeley.edu//~moretti/growth.pdf] by the economists Chang-Tai Hsieh, from the <span class="companylink">University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business</span>, and Enrico Moretti, from the <span class="companylink">University of California, Berkeley</span>, local land-use regulations reduce the United States’ economic output by as much as $1.5 trillion a year, or about 10 percent lower than it could be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is a theoretical figure that includes easy-to-see things like increased sales of building materials and more jobs for construction workers. Most of the increase, however, would come from more abstract gains like increased wages for people who are willing to move from an economically distressed city to a faster-growing economy elsewhere, but are currently unable to because housing is too expensive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over time, the accelerated pace of building could lead to a long-run deflation in home values. But for the most part that would be limited to a few coastal cities. And while the older homeowners there would most likely be resentful of all the new apartments, condos and townhomes that caused their home equity to shrivel, younger people would have an easier time getting started.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, it’s likely that lower home prices would encourage workers to move farther and more often in search of job opportunities. The impact on mobility could be huge, as the $1.5 trillion figure shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was a time, a few decades ago, when the cost of living did not vary all that much from city to city. Since then, as places like New York, San Francisco and Seattle have been hit with skyrocketing rents and home prices, the regional disparity in housing costs has altered how Americans of different incomes pursue opportunity[https://www.amazon.com/Gated-City-Kindle-Single-ebook/dp/B005KGATLO].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back when home prices were more even from place to place, people with different levels of education and income tended to flock to the same types of high-wage places, according to research[http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/shoag/files/why_has_regional_income_convergence_in_the_us_declined_01.pdf] by Daniel Shoag, a professor of public policy at Harvard, and Peter Ganong of the <span class="companylink">University of Chicago</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, people with less education tend to go where housing is cheap, like Las Vegas, while college-educated workers with skills that are in demand still go to places where wages are high, like the Bay Area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That’s because lower-income people have little to gain by going to California’s coastal cities. Wages might be higher, but as the state’s poverty figures[http://www.ccsce.com/PDF/Numbers-Sept-2016-Why-California-Poverty-Rate-Above.pdf] show, a better paycheck doesn’t help if it’s swallowed by rent. The loss of mobility makes income inequality worse, because lower-wage workers are effectively locked out of exactly those places where wages and the demand for workers are greatest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, if housing were plentiful and cheap, we would probably stop having big housing bubbles. One good way of describing a speculative bubble is a moment when society deludes itself into believing that something plentiful is scarce, or will soon be. In the mid-2000s, banks and homeowners came to believe that homes would be scarce in places like Las Vegas and Phoenix, even though there were enough materials, land and labor to keep building and building and building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing is particularly prone to bubbles because, in contrast with other products, we seem to want it more when it is expensive and less when it is cheap. And no matter how many times we look out an airplane window to see vast acres of emptiness, we somehow still believe that land is a great investment because nobody is making more of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes would still hold a lot of value; they still might appreciate, if more slowly; and desirable neighborhoods would still seem relatively expensive. But there would probably be fewer manias in which people expect home prices to double in just a few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as we don’t expect to make a profit selling our cars, if we stopped thinking of our homes as big moneymakers, we would probably start focusing on building them faster and less expensively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeff Wilson, a college professor turned entrepreneur who refers to himself as Professor Dumpster for the year he spent living in a metal trash container [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/07/education/edlife/learning-to-live-small-in-a-dumpster.html?_r=0]that he turned into a home, is trying to make this happen on a small scale. Mr. Wilson’s nascent company, Kasita[https://kasita.com/], wants to produce a line of one-bedroom homes. They would be identical in size and bought for a single price, and could be placed on city lots that traditional developers are unlikely to be interested in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes would be stacked together, creating de facto apartment buildings that could be built and unbuilt in a few weeks. Although that wouldn’t do much to help a family of four, it might take some pressure off the housing market by directing younger people to studios instead of having them pile in together, freeing up some three-bedroom apartments for families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, Americans seem unlikely to embrace this vision on a large scale, and even if they did, it would take a long time to start seeing home prices drop or flatline. But mass-produced homes from the past — brick townhouses or bungalows that came from a <span class="companylink">Sears</span> catalog — are now sought after, so this imaginary world needn’t be uglier, though it very well may be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, even if homes were a lot cheaper, we would probably retain the societal benefits of homeownership: As Mr. Glaeser and Mr. Gyourko’s data shows, housing is already relatively affordable in the vast majority of American cities. So there is little reason to believe that people would desert overpriced neighborhoods if they suddenly became cheaper.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, our view of homeownership is so entrenched in our economy, our political system and our tax code that it would be impossible to change in a short time, and probably even in a long time. But there could be political and societal benefits. What if local decisions that today are dictated by fears of declining property values could instead be made with an eye toward what’s best for education or job growth?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The point of this thought experiment isn’t to embrace it full-on, but to open our eyes to the negatives of the national obsession of owning a home, expecting its value to rise, and using the levers of local government to keep neighborhoods as they are.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A NEO-CLASSICAL STYLE APARTMENT IN CENTRAL MONTEVIDEO</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">$1.5 MILLION</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This three-bedroom, three-bathroom apartment covers the entire second floor of an 89-year-old neo-Classical style building in the center of Montevideo, the capital of Uruguay. The building, called Palacio Chiarino, was designed by three architects: Antonio Chiarino, Bartolomé Triay and Gaetano Moretti (Mr. Moretti also worked on Montevideo's Palacio Legislativo, where the country's parliament meets). The government declared Palacio Chiarino a historic landmark in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 3,660-square-foot apartment has 10 balconies that overlook the surrounding neighborhoods, including Plaza de Cagancha, one of the city's best-known public squares, and Avenida 18 de Julio, the main shopping street. The area is popular with foreign home buyers, who appreciate the architecture of the old buildings, said Carlos García Arocena, a partner in Bado &amp; Asociados Sotheby's International Realty, which is listing the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are period flourishes throughout the apartment, which is reached by an ornate iron elevator. The front door is carved wood with beveled crystal inlays. The reception area has a marble floor, granite columns and painted Venetian-style mosaics. The ceiling is hand-painted with gold leaf. Several rooms feature the original tissue wallpaper from the 1920s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ceilings in the main living areas are more than 13 feet high. In addition to a living room, the layout includes a tearoom, a reading room and an office. A Venetian-style balcony off the living room has marble floors, balusters and intricate mosaic work. The furniture is not included in the price, but pieces are available for sale, Mr. García Arocena said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the dining room, there are stained-glass windows and a Florentine-style fireplace. The restored kitchen has Italian tiles from the 1920s and the original wash basins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bedrooms are separated from the living areas by a long hallway. There are three balconies off the master bedroom, which has an en-suite bathroom with marble floors and walls. The other two bedrooms share a bathroom. All the bathrooms have hot water tanks, Mr. García Arocena said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment has a separate service entrance, elevator and living quarters for staff. There are two underground parking spaces. The building lobby is attended by a doorman during the day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment is within walking distance of shops, restaurants and Ciudad Vieja, the city's historic quarter and financial district, Mr. García Arocena said. The building is about 10 minutes from the waterfront and the popular Mercado del Puerto, the restored port market building with an array of restaurants. It is a 45-minute drive from Carrasco International Airport.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARKET OVERVIEW</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a surge in sales from 2003 to 2011, ''Montevideo's market is in a recession,'' because of a slowdown in the economy and higher property prices, Mr. García Arocena said. The number of transactions was down 10 percent in 2016 compared with a year earlier, and down almost 40 percent from 2014, he estimated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past, ''the market was driven by investors who bought properties for rent,'' Mr. García Arocena said. ''Today that market has disappeared,'' and demand is driven by retirees and young families moving into bigger homes, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Uruguay's economy has been affected by economic and political turmoil in Argentina and Brazil and by a drop in commodity prices, according to Juan Palacios, the managing director of Engel &amp; Völkers Montevideo, a real estate agency. ''We are very dependent on what happens in the Argentina and Brazil economy,'' he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no multiple listing service in Uruguay, which makes it difficult to track sales and pricing information, Mr. Palacios said. Homes often sell for as much as 20 percent below asking price, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The majority of sales are in the lower end of the market, Mr. García Arocena said. ''Luxury property transactions are very few,'' but prices have remained flat, with owners unwilling to lower prices, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most popular areas for home buyers are waterfront communities such as Pocitos and Punta Carretas, agents say. New properties on the waterfront can cost $300 to $465 a square foot, compared with close to $185 a square foot in the central part of the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHO BUYS IN MONTEVIDEO</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">International buyers represent a very small percentage of the overall market, but foreign sales are ''growing steadily,'' according to Sancho Pardo Santayana, the managing partner at 360 Terra International Realty. Most of the growth in international buyers is coming from the United States and Europe, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Argentines were once active buyers, but changes in currency regulations imposed by the Argentine government and economic turmoil have slowed the market, agents say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bulk of buyers are Uruguayans who work in the capital. Second-home buyers typically focus on coastal areas, such as Punta del Este, which is 80 miles to the east, rather than on Montevideo, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BUYING BASICS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are no restrictions on foreigners owning property in Uruguay. Deals are usually transacted in United States dollars and in cash; it is difficult to get a mortgage, agents said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The key participant in the transaction is Uruguay's version of a notary, known as an escribano, who has broad responsibility in managing the paperwork and researching the status of the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Here the notary is a kind of lawyer,'' Mr. Pardo Santayana said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers usually pay a 10 percent deposit, which is held by the buyer's notary, Mr. Pardo Santayana said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buying process may take as long as three months to complete, but ''other than that it is pretty straightforward,'' Mr. Palacios said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TAXES AND FEES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Transfer and agent fees, taxes and notary costs typically total about 8 to 9 percent of the sales price, agents say. The total includes a 2 transfer tax, a 3 percent broker fee and the 3 percent notary fee. There is also a 22 percent value-added tax on the fees paid to the broker and the notary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property tax on this apartment is about $2,500 a year, Mr. García Arocena said. There is also a monthly building maintenance fee of about $1,000 a month, he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bank stocks led a broad slide Wednesday on Wall Street that more than wiped out gains from the day before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After an early upward turn, the stock market veered into the red by midmorning, the losses accelerating as the day continued. Basic materials companies, industrials, utilities and energy stocks were among the biggest decliners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> industrial average fell 111.36 points, or 0.6 percent, to 19,833.68. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index lost 18.96 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,249.92. The <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> composite index, which had a record-high close the day before, slid 48.89 points, or 0.9 percent, to 5,438.56.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trading was light before the New Year's holiday. Two stocks fell for every one that rose on the <span class="companylink">New York Stock Exchange</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Volume is pretty weak, so there's no aggressive selling taking place,'' said Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at <span class="companylink">Nuveen Asset Management</span>. ''It's more sellers locking in some better gains than they thought they were going to get this year. It's been a really good year, so letting a little go is just fine.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three major indexes are on pace for solid gains this year. The Dow is up 13.8 percent. The S.&amp;P. 500 is on track for a 10 percent gain, while the <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> is headed for an 8.6 percent gain. Small-company stocks are up even more. The Russell 2000 is up 19.8 percent this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report from the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> found that fewer Americans signed contracts to buy homes in November. The group said its seasonally adjusted pending home sales index fell 2.5 percent to 107.3 percent, the lowest reading since the start of this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slowdown marks a reversal for the housing market, as sales growth has been solid for the past year. Homebuilder stocks closed mostly lower, with <span class="companylink">William Lyon Homes</span> losing the most. It fell 64 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $19.33.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Nvidia</span>, the chip maker, was the biggest decliner in the S.&amp;P. 500 index, sliding 6.9 percent after short seller Citron Research said it expected Nvidiar's shares, which have tripled in value this year, to fall substantially. The stock lost $8.07 to $109.25.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares in oil and natural gas drilling companies also declined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Chesapeake Energy</span> lost 36 cents, or 4.7 percent, to $7.23. <span class="companylink">Murphy Oil</span> shed 78 cents, or 2.4 percent, to $32.03. <span class="companylink">Helmerich &amp; Payne</span> fell $1.57, or 2 percent, to $78.39.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Qualcomm</span>, a maker of computer chips, slipped 2.2 percent after antitrust regulators in South Korea fined the company $865 million, saying it engaged in unfair sales practices, including refusing to let competitors license patents that are essential for making chips. The stock lost $1.50 to $65.75.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Markets overseas were mostly subdued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Europe, Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40 each ended essentially flat. Britain's FTSE 100 posted a record-high close of 7,106.08, a gain of 0.5 percent. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 was flat. Australia's S.&amp;P. <span class="companylink">ASX</span> 200 gained 1 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index gained 0.8 percent. South Korea's Kospi dropped 0.9 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Benchmark United States crude rose 16 cents to close at $54.06 a barrel in New York. It rose 88 cents on Tuesday. Brent crude, used to price international oils, climbed 13 cents to close at $56.22 a barrel in London. It gained 93 cents the day before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.51 percent from 2.56 percent late Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In currency trading, the dollar fell to 117.19 yen, down from 117.45 on Tuesday. The euro fell to $1.0407 from $1.0458.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among metals, the price of gold rose $2.10 to $1,139.40 an ounce.</p>

Nasdaq Hits Record; Dow Inches Toward 20,000</span>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A day of quiet trading on Wall Street ended Tuesday with the <span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> industrial average inching closer to 20,000 and with a record high for the <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> composite index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Materials and technology companies led stocks slightly higher over all. Shares of energy companies also rose as the price of crude oil increased. Utilities and phone company stocks edged lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow added 11.23 points, or 0.1 percent, to 19,945.04. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index gained 5.09 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,268.88. The <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> rose 24.75 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,487.44. Its last record high was 5,483.94 on Dec. 20.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trading was light after the long holiday weekend, with fewer than 1.9 billion shares traded on the <span class="companylink">New York Stock Exchange</span>. That is the lightest full day of trading since October 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Markets are moving toward 20,000, and bond yields are up; there's a little bit of buoyancy in oil prices,'' said Erik Davidson, chief investment officer at Wells Fargo Private Bank. But he said that trading was ''very, very thin.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three major indexes are on pace for solid gains for 2016, led by the Dow, which is up 14.5 percent. The S.&amp;P. 500 is on track for an 11 percent gain, while the <span class="companylink">Nasdaq</span> is headed for a 9.6 percent gain. Small-company stocks are up even more. The Russell 2000 is up 21 percent this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though little new major economic or company data is expected this week as 2016 ends, investors got fresh figures on consumer confidence and home prices Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span> said its consumer confidence index rose to 113.7 in December, from 109.4 in November, and was the highest since it hit 114 in August 2001. And the Standard &amp; Poor's CoreLogic Case-Shiller national home price index rose 5.6 percent in October, as buyers bidding for scarce properties drove prices higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several homebuilders gained after the reports on home prices and consumer confidence, which bode well for home sales. <span class="companylink">Lennar</span> led the pack, gaining 80 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $43.36. <span class="companylink">D. R. Horton</span> added 37 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $27.93. <span class="companylink">PulteGroup</span> rose 24 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $18.62.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chip maker <span class="companylink">Nvidia</span> posted the biggest gain in the S.&amp;P. 500 index, surging $7.54, or 6.9 percent, to $117.32. <span class="companylink">Fitbit</span> climbed 7.4 percent after its fitness tracker app became one of the most downloaded in the iTunes store. The stock added 54 cents to $7.83.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Europe, Germany's DAX rose 0.2 percent, while the CAC 40 of France closed 0.2 percent higher. Markets in Britain were closed for Boxing Day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Asia earlier, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 was nearly flat. The Kospi of South Korea rose 0.2 percent, while India's Sensex added 0.8 percent. Markets in Hong Kong and Australia were also closed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Benchmark United States crude rose 88 cents, or 1.7 percent, to close at $53.90 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, gained 93 cents, or 1.7 percent, to close at $56.09 a barrel in London.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year United States Treasury note rose to 2.56 percent from 2.54 percent late Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In currency trading, the dollar rose to 117.45 yen from 117.26. The euro rose to $1.0458 from $1.0452.</p>

</div><div class="author">By REUTERS </div><div>600 words</div><div>28 December 2016</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A measure of consumer confidence shot to its highest level in more than 15 years in December as Americans saw more strength ahead in business conditions, stock prices and the job market following the election of Donald J. Trump as president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report showed that house prices continued their steady recovery in October, although a spike in borrowing costs after Election Day could present a headwind to sustained home value gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span> said Tuesday that its Consumer Confidence Index rose to 113.7 this month from an upwardly revised 109.4 in November. That topped estimates in a Reuters poll for a reading of 109.0, and was the highest since August 2001.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at The Conference Board, said in a statement that the gain in confidence was entirely because of rising expectations, as consumers' assessments of current conditions dipped, and was led by surging optimism among older Americans. The private economic forecasting group's Expectations Index hit its highest mark since December 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The modest pullback in current conditions ''still suggests that economic growth continued through the final months of 2016,'' Ms. Franco said. ''Looking ahead to 2017, consumers' continued optimism will depend on whether or not their expectations are realized.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trump will inherit an economy that by most assessments is on solid footing, even if growth has been subdued for much of President Obama's term. The unemployment rate recently dropped to 4.6 percent, its lowest since the Great Recession ended, and the economy has added an average of 188,000 new jobs a month over the past 12 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With benchmark 10-year Treasury yields around their highest in more than two years, the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage in the United States has hit its highest point since May 2014, potentially posing a risk to the recovery in housing prices, which continued apace in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S.&amp;P. <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> Case-Shiller composite index of 20 metropolitan areas rose 5.1 percent in October on a year-over-year basis, up from a downwardly adjusted 5 percent climb in September and matching the estimate of a 5.1 percent gain from a Reuters poll of economists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Home prices and the economy are both enjoying robust numbers,'' said David M. Blitzer, managing director and chairman of the index committee at S.&amp;P. Dow Jones Indices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''However, mortgage interest rates rose in November and are expected to rise further as home prices continue to outpace gains in wages and personal income,'' he said. ''Affordability trends do not suggest an immediate reversal in home price trends. Nevertheless, home prices cannot rise faster than incomes and inflation indefinitely.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in the 20 cities rose 0.6 percent in October from a revised 0.5 percent in September on a seasonally adjusted basis, the survey showed, outpacing expectations of a 0.5 percent increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest year-over-year gains were recorded in the West and in Texas, including gains of more than 10 percent in the Seattle and Portland areas. Prices in the Denver and Dallas markets increased by more than 8 percent from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The smallest annual gain was in the New York metro area, where prices rose just 1.7 percent.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Manhattan real estate market reached new heights once again in 2016.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apartments sold at record prices, on average, while sales at recent residential developments outpaced last year's brisk volume.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York City's highest residence, a penthouse at the pinnacle of the super tall 432 Park Avenue, finally closed. And the price was -- you guessed it -- the highest for the year, at just over $87.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the market also showed signs of slowing down, particularly in the ultraluxury sector, where units like those at 432 Park Avenue are taking longer to sell and discounts are becoming more common. An increase in inventory, from new developments and resellers still hoping to cash out big, is partly responsible. Another contributing factor is the absence of the pent-up demand that lingered after the recession, when construction came to a near halt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's definitely more negotiating going on,'' said Kathryn A. Korte, the chief executive of Sotheby's International Realty, which specializes in luxury properties. She has seen a shift at a range of prices, she said: ''I wouldn't say it's completely a buyer's market, but buyers have jumped in when they've seen value.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And therein lies the rub, said Jonathan J. Miller of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel: ''There's a mismatch between price and value, and the buyers know that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 432 Park Avenue, buyers who signed contracts and completed their transactions this year received price reductions averaging 10 percent, Mr. Miller said. In one recent closing, a penthouse on the 88th floor sold for $60.9 million to the money manager Lewis A. Sanders and his wife, Alice, at a 20 percent markdown from the original price of $76.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The current contract prices reflect the new market,'' Mr. Miller said, ''not the one established several years ago,'' when many new high-rises were little more than holes in the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he and others are optimistic about New York's housing market going into the new year. While certain buyers can afford to be more choosy because they have more options, he noted, demand remains strong. In some circles, there is even talk of an eventual undersupply of inventory (beyond what's already happening in the market's lower end), as the city's population continues to grow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is the one place in the world that continues to be a safe place to put your dollars,'' said the developer Ben H. Shaoul, the principal of the Magnum Real Estate Group. Mr. Shaoul said he is willing to negotiate with buyers on a building-by-building basis, though he is quick to reject offers considered too low. He, for one, thinks supply in the ''non-uber-high-end'' will be limited in the not-too-distant future. ''The growth of the population continues,'' he said. ''People need to move and they're buying larger apartments.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not surprisingly, the properties that are priced well seem to be moving fastest. ''There continue to be some robust bidding wars, and apartments selling quickly,'' said Pamela Liebman, the chief executive of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>. But ''for 2017 to be a successful year,'' she added, ''the seller will have to get on board and understand that prices have taken a pause -- even in the lower end of the market.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher-priced homes are taking considerably longer to sell. The median number of days that properties $9.5 million and higher spent on the market was 187 as of November, 37 more than last year, said Jonathan Smoke, the chief economist of Realtor.com. The median time on the market for all Manhattan properties so far this year, he said, was 87 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average sales price of those properties -- all apartments, co-ops and condominiums sold in Manhattan this year -- reached a record $2.2 million, or $1,886 a square foot, according to a year-end market report by CityRealty, which tracks apartment sales. The previous record, set last year, was $1.9 million, or $1,735 a square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This upward trajectory, however, reflects the steady stream of transactions at higher-priced developments like 432 Park Avenue, Greenwich Lane on West 11th and 12th Streets and 150 Charles Street. More than two dozen properties, in fact, closed above $30 million this year, according to city property records, almost half of them at 432 Park Avenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 1,800 new-development sales are expected to be recorded at year's end by CityRealty's calculations, compared with 1,464 in 2015. The average unit price at these developments: a record $4.9 million, up from the previous record of $4.8 million, set in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">432 Park Avenue</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was a flurry of closed sales at this slender concrete-and-glass skyscraper on Billionaires' Row, between 56th and 57th Streets. The tallest residential tower in the Western Hemisphere, topping out at 1,396 feet, this Rafael Viñoly-designed building has helped redraw the city's skyline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some of these 2016 transactions had been in the works for years, like the full-floor penthouse on the 96th floor, which closed in September at $87,660,898. The buyer was the Saudi retail magnate Fawaz Alhokair. He apparently renegotiated the price: When news of the sale first surfaced more than three years ago, the contracted price was reported to be $95 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard Wallgren, the executive vice president for sales and marketing at Macklowe Properties, the building's developer, along with the <span class="companylink">CIM Group</span>, said he couldn't comment on individual deals, most of which involve buyers using limited liability corporations to shield their identities. But he did confirm that price reductions were continuing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are negotiating -- we want to sell apartments,'' Mr. Wallgren said, adding that about three-quarters of the building's 104 units have sold or are under contract. ''We've already had significant price increases over two to three years, so there's plenty of room to be negotiating.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, he added, ''Because of our strong financial footing, there's no urgency at all. By the end of next year, it'll be sold out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the top-floor penthouse was the priciest sale at 432 Park Avenue (and in the city this year), it was still nearly $13 million below New York's current sale-price record-holder: the penthouse at neighboring One57, which officially closed at nearly $100.5 million in early 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other Condominiums</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly all the top sales this year were in condominiums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of these closed transactions were at new luxury developments like 150 Charles Street, a brick-and-glass building in the West Village that had all its units spoken for just weeks after sales opened almost four years ago. (The rocker Jon Bon Jovi was among the buyers.) A duplex penthouse there, with landscaped terraces, closed for $34.4 million; another penthouse, which also had outdoor space, closed for $29.4 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several apartments sold at the Greenwich Lane complex, on the site of the former St. Vincent's Hospital campus in Greenwich Village. But the biggest condo sale that wasn't at 432 Park Avenue was at One57. Unit No. 83, a four-bedroom four-and-a-half-bath apartment, sold for $45.8 million; it had been listed for as much as $58.5 million last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just behind that transaction was a sale at Walker Tower, an Art Deco condo conversion in Chelsea, at 212 West 18th Street. A full-floor penthouse there sold for $45 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And for $42.8 million, the bottom four floors of the Atterbury Mansion, part of a condo complex at 33 East 74th Street, sold; it has an alternate address of 933 Madison Avenue. This apartment is being combined with an adjoining three-bedroom that the unidentified buyer previously purchased for $15.8 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While most buyers hid their identities through LLCs, others with recognizable names weren't afraid to go public -- among them, the developer Jared C. Kushner, the son-in-law of President-elect Donald Trump, who sold the second of six loft-style apartments at Puck Penthouses, a luxury condominium his firm assembled atop the landmark Puck Building in NoLIta. The price was $28.5 million. Katie Couric and her husband, the financier John P. Molner, bought an apartment that spans the entire 10th floor of 151 East 78th Street, a new limestone-and-brick condo, for $12.2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Co-ops</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Co-op apartments generally sell for less than condos, but three co-ops with Central Park views closed above $30 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most expensive, at $52 million, encompasses the whole fifth floor of 4 East 66th Street, a 1920 limestone building designed by James E. R. Carpenter. The home, with more than 7,500 square feet, is just one of 16 apartments in the building, also known as 845 Fifth Avenue. The hedge fund manager and philanthropist Daniel L. Nir and his wife, Jill E. Braufman, were the sellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 101 Central Park West, unit 9BC closed at $35.3 million. The sellers were Keith Anderson, a founder of the asset management company <span class="companylink">BlackRock</span>, and his wife, Peggy. The couple had initially wanted $42 million when they placed the apartment on the market in early 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the chief executive of the Loews Corporation, James S. Tisch, paid $32 million for an apartment at 1040 Fifth Avenue, a prewar building designed by Rosario Candela and home to many prominent residents over the years, including Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. The purchase was made through a trust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other notable co-op sales, the former Citigroup chairman Sanford I. Weill, whose $88 million penthouse sale at 15 Central Park West set a city record in 2012, was revealed to be the buyer of an Upper East Side penthouse. Mr. Weill, who also used a trust, paid $22.5 million for PHAB at 791 Park Avenue, between East 73rd and 74th Streets. The sellers were the celebrity stylist Jill Swid Rosen and her husband, Eric S. Rosen, a money manager; the couple overhauled the apartment in a nearly three-year renovation. It came on the market in early May for $26.9 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Helen Gurley Brown's turreted quadruplex atop the Beresford, at 211 Central Park West, sold for $19.4 million. The longtime editor of Cosmopolitan magazine had lived there for four decades, until her death in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg paid $14 million for a triplex at 19 East 79th Street, the co-op townhouse next to his Beaux-Arts limestone house. He is apparently looking to create a double-wide mansion for himself eventually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Townhouses</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Double-wide seemed to be a catchphrase in townhouse activity this year. The celebrity couple and real estate aficionados Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick paid $34.5 million for two adjoining brick buildings on West 11th Street in the West Village: Nos. 273 and 275. Dolly Lenz, their broker, noted in an <span class="companylink">Instagram</span> post that the combined townhouses would serve as the couple's new home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another big townhouse sale, just a few houses away, involved the media mogul Rupert Murdoch. He sold his mansion at 278 West 11th Street for $27.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The year's biggest single townhouse purchase was made by the developer Matthew Adell. He paid $28 million for 27 East 79th Street, just a few doors down from Mr. Bloomberg's mansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2017 and Beyond</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Market watchers are predicting few changes in the new year, although interest rates are edging up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's not going to be that much of a difference between this year and next,'' Mr. Miller, the appraiser, said. ''The local economy here is strong, and that's been an important driver.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and others say they have observed a slight uptick in sales activity since the election, which may carry into next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A number of developers and brokers, in fact, expressed optimism about how New York City real estate might fare under a President Trump, who has a long history of development here. ''This administration is going to be pro real estate,'' said Dorothy Herman, the chief executive of Douglas Elliman Real Estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CityRealty's year-end report predicts that average prices for Manhattan apartments will remain about the same, though it forecasts a slight dip in average condo prices, to $2.9 million from $3.1 million this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of that could change in 2018, however, when 220 Central Park South, being developed by <span class="companylink">Vornado Realty Trust</span>, is expected to open. One of the listings there, brokers say, is a four-floor apartment at a record-breaking price: $250 million.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1988, Lynn Vear and her husband, Dale Schultz, were living in the Ashbury Heights neighborhood of San Francisco and choosing between private city schooling for their young son, Cody, and decamping to the suburbs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then Cody barreled down a hill on his tricycle, stopping just short of a busy street. ''We're moving,'' Mr. Schultz recalled declaring after his heart rate returned to normal. They took off for Mill Valley, a town in Marin County spread over canyons and slopes on the southeastern flank of Mount Tamalpais.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Schultz, 65, who is a financial adviser, and Ms. Vear, 64, who does development work for the <span class="companylink">International Rescue Committee</span>, a relief organization, said friends introduced them to the laid-back town. The couple had rejected Berkeley and other East Bay points that felt ''urban and congested,'' Ms. Vear said. Nor did they want to move farther north in Marin because of the commute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After raising two sons in the Mill Valley flats, a place convenient to shops and schools, they paid $1.8 million in 2009 for a three-bedroom, three-bath 1967 house built on Lovell Avenue, above Cascade Canyon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From their two rear decks, they look onto redwood-forested peaks and soaring raptors. Mount Tamalpais is so close that you almost feel you could stroke its rough green coat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small (the population is about 14,000), quiet and notably lacking in diversity, Mill Valley is sometimes disparaged as ''Mill Valium.'' But the town's widespread charms and excellent schools keep many residents rooted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commercial district concentrated along Throckmorton Avenue between Madrona Street and Blithedale Avenue has boutiques, galleries, restaurants and entertainment places, some bankrolled by local celebrities. Bob Weir, the Grateful Dead guitarist, helped to revive Sweetwater, a bar where local musicians, including Jerry Garcia and Bonnie Raitt, performed from 1972 to 2007. In 2012, it reopened as Sweetwater Music Hall in the town's 113-year-old Masonic Lodge at 19 Corte Madera Avenue. Sammy Hagar, the former lead singer of Van Halen, owns El Paseo, a steakhouse at 17 Throckmorton Avenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What You'll Find</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mill Valley is in southern Marin County, about 11 miles north of San Francisco via Route 101, past Sausalito. Jane Manning, who has sold real estate in the area since 1986, said that most homes are undistinguished midcentury bungalows and, to a lesser extent, Victorian or early-20th-century houses and are typically 1,200 to 1,500 square feet, with few exceeding 5,000 square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People are not living large,'' she said. ''They're living there because they want to be there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because strict preservation laws discourage tear-downs, and a lack of buildable land drastically limits new construction, Mill Valley's inventory is low. ''There are multiple offers on every house,'' Ms. Manning said, adding that such scarcity is common throughout Marin County and drives up prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For people seeking alternatives to a single-family house, Mill Valley is not obliging, she said. The condo market is small, and units are often built in townhouses with stairs, making them unfeasible for older residents looking to downsize. However, there are efforts statewide and locally to refine policies for creating and renting out accessory units, assisting both the people who have more house than they need and those looking for reasonably priced accommodations. And a new Landlord Partnership Program in Marin County offers incentives for landlords to create affordable housing for low-income residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What You'll Pay</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the real estate information website Homesnap, as of Dec. 12, the median sales price of single-family homes in Mill Valley was $1.58 million, a year-on-year increase of 8.6 percent. The median price of condos was $728,000, a year-on-year decrease of 36.4 percent (because there are relatively few condos available, median sales prices can fluctuate wildly from year to year).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of Dec. 19, 44 homes were listed on the website of Decker Bullock Sotheby's International Realty, drawn from multiple sources. Single-family house listings ranged in price from $910,000, for a 1970 three-bedroom, one-bath house at 304 Dolan Avenue, to $6,950,000, for a four-bedroom, four-bath 2007 house with a pool on 13.4 acres at 114 Inez Place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condos ranged from $469,000, for a one-bedroom, one-bath 696-square-foot unit at 554 Seaver Drive, to $727,000, for a two-bedroom, two-bath 1,054-square-foot unit at 1109 Shelter Bay Avenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Vibe</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lara Hedberg Deam, the founder of Dwell magazine, could be considered made for Mill Valley. In 1994, she moved there from Washington, D.C., buying a dilapidated shotgun house that she shared with the surfer she was dating and the dog she had smuggled out of Mexico. (They parked their R.V. out front.) After substantially renovating the place -- an effort that drove her to learn more about design and ultimately start her own publication -- she continues to live in the house with her husband, the architect and designer Christopher Deam, and their teenage twins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house is downtown. (''When I was in my 20s, I couldn't imagine driving for coffee,'' Ms. Deam said.) Even so, a favorite hiking path starts a short walking distance from her house. ''The mountain is really the thing that keeps me and a lot of us here,'' she said, referring to Mount Tamalpais.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the easygoing environment, some longtime residents say that the influx of new money has made Mill Valley less friendly. Real estate is more expensive than in San Francisco, where the median price of a single-family home as of November was $1.36 million There are complaints of arrogant drivers in fancy vehicles clogging up the roads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Some people like to blame it on <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span>,'' Ms. Deam said of the congestion, which she attributes to support staff employed by increasingly affluent homeowners. ''The overarching struggle is that people want Mill Valley to stay how it was when they came,'' she said. ''My opinion is that things are always changing, and that's just how it is.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Schools</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mill Valley is served by five public elementary schools, including Old Mill Elementary School, at 352 Throckmorton Avenue, which has about 320 students, kindergarten through fifth grade. On 2014-15 state tests, the last for which figures were offered, 82 percent of students met standards in English versus 49 percent statewide; 83 percent met standards in math versus 37 percent statewide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Edna Maguire Elementary School, a public school at 80 Lomita Drive, has about 570 students, kindergarten through fifth grade. On 2014-15 state tests, 83 percent of students met standards in English; 74 percent met standards in math.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mill Valley Middle School, a public school at 425 Sycamore Avenue, has about 1,055 students, sixth through eighth grades. On 2014-15 state tests, 83 percent of students met standards in English versus 48 percent statewide; 74 percent met standards in math versus 36 percent statewide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tamalpais High School, a public school at 700 Miller Avenue, has about 1,525 students, 10th through 12th grades. The 2015 average combined SAT score was 1,725 out of a possible 2,400, versus 1,473 statewide; the average ACT score was 26, versus 22 statewide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commute</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mill Valley is not served by <span class="companylink">Bay Area Rapid Transit</span>. The drive from downtown to Market Street in San Francisco, via Route 101, takes about a half-hour. The Golden Gate Bridge toll is $7.50, or $6.50 with a Bay Area FasTrak tag.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Golden Gate Transit offers a commuter bus between Mill Valley and San Francisco, Mondays through Fridays, except holidays. The trip from the Mill Valley depot at Miller Avenue and Sunnyside Avenue to San Francisco's financial district takes about 45 minutes and costs $5.50.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The History</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mill Valley was named by John Thomas Reed, an Irishman who was one of the region's first European settlers and built a sawmill in the 1830s on Cascade Creek, in what is now Old Mill Park. A train station that opened in 1889 helped turn the area into a summer resort. Early-20th-century visitors would travel up Mount Tamalpais for hiking excursions on what was described as the crookedest railroad in the world (281 curves in slightly more than eight miles of track), returning downhill in cars propelled by gravity. Mill Valley's annual 7.4-mile Dipsea Race, which is run from the center of town over hills and canyons, ending at Stinson Beach, began in 1905.</p>

She moved into a 1920s house on 44th Street, one of a pair that the family of her then-boyfriend (now husband) had bought for a total of about $625,000. Her sister-in-law lives in the other house. ''A little compound,'' Ms. Knudsen Thomas, 41, calls the arrangement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the secure niche, Ms. Knudsen Thomas, who owns a Pilates studio in the Montclair Village neighborhood of Oakland, has watched Temescal develop with the unevenness of a colt. Referring to the continuing homelessness, crime and spotty conveniences (the neighborhood, for instance, lacks a grocery store), she said, ''There's an influx of people with more money, but I haven't seen that it's improved people's lives.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She was speaking last month at Aunt Mary's Cafe, one of several popular restaurants on Telegraph Avenue, Temescal's main commercial street. A couple of blocks north, the daily lunchtime queue was inching into Bakesale Betty, which is celebrated for its fried chicken sandwiches. Nearby, in Temescal Alleys -- a cluster of 18 independent businesses set up in stalls that once housed trolley horses -- customers admired handmade jewelry, ate high-end ice cream and had their beards trimmed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With its appealing stores and fine dining, Telegraph Avenue has helped make Temescal a destination for visitors, but there is concern about the neighborhood's future for residents. Realtors say that an overheated housing market in the rapidly gentrifying Oakland flats, which include Temescal, is driving prices far above actual property values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alex Michas, a real estate broker who lives in the neighborhood, said, ''There are times when the difference between what the market will pay and what an appraiser says a home is worth can be as much as $100,000 on a million-dollar purchase.'' Two houses on his street each recently sold for $1.5 million, a figure that he said was unsupported by the quality and condition of the buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Michas said Oakland was in high demand because its prices remained lower than those in San Francisco, and because buyers who spent many hours at their demanding Bay Area jobs were eager to have the fast, direct access to them that the neighborhood offered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many in the neighborhood are concerned about the loss of established businesses and the displacement of low-income residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some have challenged a proposed 24-story development across the street from the Bay Area Rapid Transit MacArthur Station on 40th Street. They say that with 402 market-rate apartments (as well as 45 affordable ones), it would effectively be a vertical gated community whose height and wealth would be at odds with the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there were cheers last year when the Kingfish Pub &amp; Cafe, which had operated on Claremont Avenue since the repeal of Prohibition, moved its entire building 35 yards to 5227 Telegraph Avenue after it was threatened with demolition to make way for a condominium project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, many of the enterprises that give Temescal its cachet not only contribute tax dollars that help it prosper but are sensitive to the needs of an economically diverse community. Ruby's Garden, for example, a children's store at 5026 Telegraph, sells new and secondhand clothes so there's something affordable for everyone, while Temescal Brewing opened in June 2016 at 4115 Telegraph Avenue with the slogan: ''Fresh beer. No jerks.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sarita Waite and Raymond Lifchez, who helped develop and currently manage the Temescal Alleys complex east of Telegraph Avenue at 49th Street, are leasing retail spaces at prices they said were below market rate and were installing a plaza and garden in the back for public use ''without commercialization.'' When it opens next year, this ''campo pro bono,'' as they envision it, is expected to be the site of chess games, baby-nursing interludes, live music and outdoor film screenings (the movies are already a summertime ritual hosted by Pizzaiolo, a popular restaurant at 5008 Telegraph Avenue).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What You'll Find</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though Temescal's boundaries are up for debate, they extend roughly to 51st Street to the north, 40th Street to the south, Broadway to the east and the Grove-Shafter freeway to the west.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The typical house is a two- or three-bedroom Craftsman or Mediterranean-style bungalow dating from the 1910s or 1920s. There are also small, multifamily apartment buildings and an increasing number of new and converted condominiums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A farmers' market is held every Sunday at 5300 Claremont Avenue. (A knife sharpener will be present the week before Christmas.) The nearest grocery store, a rebuilt <span class="companylink">Safeway</span> on Broadway north of 51st Street, opened in September in a new retail development. The Oakland Public Library branch at 5205 Telegraph Avenue has a tool-lending program with more than 5,000 items available. The branch will close for renovations on Dec. 23, and reopen in May 2017.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What You'll Pay</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the real estate information website Homesnap, for this year through Dec. 13, the median sales price of a home in Temescal was $1 million, an increase of 33 percent over the previous year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only a handful of Temescal listings from various brokers were featured on Redfin's website as of Dec. 13. These included a three-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bath house at 4839 Clarke Street, priced at $1,050,000; and a two-bedroom, two-bath house at 412 48th Street, priced at $899,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Vibe</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's like Diagon Alley for hipsters,'' said Sam Benothman, sitting with his dog, Ace, outside the Temescal Alley Barbershop as he waited for his name to be called. Like the retail hub for wizards in the Harry Potter books and movies, Temescal Alley seems like a quaint alternative shopping universe. Only steps away from the wide boulevard of Telegraph Avenue, with its Korean and Ethiopian restaurants, the little pedestrian thoroughfare also contrasts with the industrial buildings east on Broadway and the vintage houses with pocket-size front lawns on the blocks in between. Together, these pieces of Temescal make up a very wide world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Schools</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Emerson Elementary School, a public school at 4803 Lawton Avenue, has about 325 students in kindergarten through fifth grade. On 2015-16 California tests, 19 percent met standards in English, versus 49 percent statewide; 11 percent met standards in math, versus 37 percent statewide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Oakland Technical High School</span>, a public school at 4351 Broadway that is considered one of the best in the city, has about 2,040 students in ninth to 12th grade. Average SAT scores at the school for 2014-15, the latest year for which comparative data is offered, were 515 in reading, 520 in math and 503 in writing, versus statewide averages of 489, 500 and 484.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oakland International High School, a public school at 4521 Webster Street, offers college preparatory studies, with an emphasis on English, to students who have recently immigrated. It has about 350 students in ninth to 12th grade. Average SAT scores for 2014-15 were 308 in reading, 352 in math and 327 in writing, versus statewide averages of 489, 500 and 484.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commute</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Temescal is served by the <span class="companylink">Bay Area Rapid Transit</span>'s MacArthur Station, on 40th Street, west of Telegraph Avenue. From there, it's about a 15-minute trip to the Embarcadero Station in downtown San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The History</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Temescal is named for a creek that once ran prominently through Oakland and now exists mostly underground. The word derives from the Nahuatl language of the Aztecs and means ''sweat house,'' probably after Mexican settlers' description of structures built by the Ohlone people who occupied the region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Originally part of ranchland owned by Vicente Peralta in the 19th century, Temescal developed around one of the roads where a telegraph line was strung between Oakland and Martinez, Calif., in 1859. The village was annexed by Oakland in 1897.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given the higher upfront costs of buying vs. renting, how long does the investment take to pay off? Or put another way, how long do buyers have to wait before they see a cost savings over renting?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">StreetEasy recently identified neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Manhattan where buyers could expect to see cost savings the soonest. The calculation took into account the various costs of buying (including purchase price and 20 percent down payment, interest rates, closing costs, insurance, maintenance and renovation) and weighed them against what a typical renter might expect to pay (monthly rent, security deposit, broker's fee, renter's insurance and other costs). StreetEasy's price and rent indexes, which track changes in sales and rental prices of properties listed on the site, also weighed heavily.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because many of StreetEasy's neighborhoods were out of reach for the average buyer, we asked them to rerun the data using the same criteria, but this time to find the most affordable neighborhoods for buying: those in which the median home price was at or below the borough's median ($990,805 in Manhattan and $576,132 in Brooklyn, according to StreetEasy's 2016 third-quarter data). The results are presented here. (For a more customized forecast taking into account the details of your own situation, try using The New York Times's ''Is It Better to Rent or Buy?'' calculator.)</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FEDERAL regulators have raised the amount of money that home buyers can borrow while still qualifying for more flexible mortgage terms, starting next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The change for 2017 isn't huge, but it may help some buyers who are struggling to afford a home, especially in areas with relatively few homes for sale and rising home prices, real estate experts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here is what is changing: For the first time in a decade, the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> raised the dollar limit on loans that qualify for purchase by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, the government-controlled mortgage finance giants. Such conventional or ''conforming'' loans are less risky for lenders, so they typically qualify for lower down payments, and often lower interest rates, allowing more borrowers to buy a home as prices rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Loans that exceed the limit are considered ''jumbo'' mortgages, which lenders hold themselves or sell to private investors; they typically require larger down payments and stricter underwriting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current loan limit of $417,000 has remained unchanged since 2006; a law put in place during the housing downturn mandated that home prices had to rise to precrash levels before the limit could be increased. Last week, the housing finance agency said its index showed that average home prices had risen above 2007 levels, allowing the loan limit to be raised.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starting in January, the loan limit for single-family homes will increase by $7,000, to just over $424,000, in most parts of the country. In some expensive areas -- like Boston, New York City, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. -- the limit will go to just over $686,000, and it will be even higher in a few markets in Hawaii and Alaska.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ''modest'' move is another recognition that housing markets have recovered from the real-estate crash, said David Stevens, chief executive of the Mortgage Bankers Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The higher limit will give more borrowers access to the more-flexible terms of government-backed loans, helping to ensure that home buyers can still get affordable mortgages as home values rise, said Aaron Terrazas, a senior economist with the real estate website Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zillow expects home prices to rise 3.6 percent in 2017 and noted that in some markets -- such as the resort area of the Hamptons outside New York City -- homes are worth more now than ever.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zillow estimates that about 30,000 more homes in the New York metropolitan area will fall into conforming loan territory because of the new limits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It provides a little bit more wiggle room,'' Mr. Terrazas said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some real estate professionals say the $7,000 increase, amounting to a rise of less than 2 percent, isn't large enough to offset spiraling home prices in many markets. Keith Dunham, chief executive of HomeCity Real Estate in Austin, Tex., said that in his area, the housing supply was not sufficient to meet the rising demand from people moving to Austin, a popular technology-oriented city, so the modestly higher loan limit would probably not make a big difference. ''It doesn't move the needle,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Elizabeth Ann Stribling-Kivlan, president of <span class="companylink">Stribling &amp; Associates</span> in New York City, said the move might provide a psychological boost for home shoppers. ''It gives extra confidence that one can buy a home,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are some questions and answers about mortgage loans:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How large a down payment do I need for a conventional loan?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The standard requirement is 20 percent down, but conventional loans can now be had with down payments as low as 5 percent or even 3 percent, according to the housing finance agency. However, borrowers often are required to buy mortgage insurance, which adds to their monthly payment, and meet other criteria to qualify.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Will higher mortgage rates make it more expensive to borrow?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates have been rising since the presidential election, and the average is now 4.08 percent for a 30-year, fixed-rate loan, the highest it has been all year, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>'s weekly mortgage market survey, released on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, rates remain historically low, said Mr. Terrazas of Zillow. In 2006, the annual average was above 6 percent. And throughout the 1980s, for instance, double-digit rates were the norm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where can I check the new loan limits for 2017 in my area?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zillow has a map of the new loan limits by county on its website.</p>

</div><div class="author">By JULIE LASKY </div><div>1208 words</div><div>27 November 2016</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>The New York Times on the Web</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Rob Grace, 36, wants to remove a branch of an oak or poplar on his property in Takoma Park, Md., he has to consult with the town arborist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Considered one of the most progressive cities in the United States, Takoma Park, a suburb immediately northeast of Washington, D.C., is not just a nuclear-free zone, a hotbed of former Peace Corps volunteers and a municipality that has extended the local vote to noncitizens and 16- and 17-year-olds; it is also home to an impressive number of healthy, mature trees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Grace, who is an analyst at the Government Accountability Office in Washington, said that because of the greenery, you can actually feel the air cool when you cross into Maryland, something he does regularly as a commuter, walking home from the local Metro station on the District side. (Takoma Park is not to be confused with Takoma in Washington, D.C., though the two share a border, a business district and a Fourth of July parade.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and his wife, Krysti, a middle-school teacher, live in a 1,000-square-foot 1955 house on Cedar Avenue, in Takoma Park's historic district, which they bought in 2010 for $470,000. They moved to the area shortly after their first child was born and recently had a second child.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Considering the city's proximity to a major metropolis, Mr. Grace said, it ''has a remarkable sense of peace and quiet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kate Stewart, Takoma Park's mayor, said the city ''is a diverse community that welcomes people from all over the world.'' A third of its nearly 18,000 residents were born outside of the United States, and its municipal website can be translated with a click into Amharic, Mandarin, Spanish, German, Russian and French.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spirit of civility and liberalism is evident even to casual visitors. In October, a sign was spotted on the window of a local bookstore, announcing, ''Hate has no business here.'' Another declared the prohibition of firearms. The Takoma Park Presbyterian Church, at 310 Tulip Avenue, bore a large ''Black Lives Matter'' banner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What You'll Find</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Located in Montgomery County, Md., Takoma Park is bounded by Eastern Avenue to the southwest; New Hampshire Avenue to the southeast; Silver Spring, Md., to the northwest and north; and Langley Park, Md., to the northeast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing stock is almost as diverse as the population -- a mix of late 19th-century neo-Gothic farmhouses, 1920s bungalows, midcentury ranch houses and contemporary multifamily apartment complexes. ''When they think of Takoma Park, most people think of beautiful Victorian homes,'' Ms. Stewart said. ''A lot of people don't know that half of our residents are renters.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What You'll Pay</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the year through Nov. 21, the median sales price of homes in Takoma Park was $436,250, an 8 percent increase over the same time last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only 33 residential properties, culled from multiple listing sources, were featured for sale on the website of <span class="companylink">Long &amp; Foster Real Estate</span>, as of Nov. 22. They ranged in price from a 486-square-foot studio apartment at 7333 New Hampshire Avenue, listed at $168,500, to a new six-bedroom four-and-a-half-bath contemporary house at 6506 Kansas Lane, listed at $1.075 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meg Finn of <span class="companylink">Long &amp; Foster</span>, who has sold real estate in the area for nearly 30 years, said that low inventory reflects the late fall season, when homeowners withdraw unsold houses from the market, planning to reintroduce them in the spring. On the whole, she said, buyers are ''condition-conscious,'' looking for properties that do not require renovation. With home equity loans hard to come by, she said, houses that need a great deal of work are ''doubly discounted'' in order to move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Properties in good condition sell quickly, Ms. Finn added, snapped up by buyers who are attracted to Takoma Park's convenient transportation, good schools and low housing prices compared with those in Washington or Bethesda, Md. In those places, she said, ''a million dollars isn't anything, whereas here we've had million-dollar sales, but not as routine.'' She noted that $400,000 is the bottom figure for a single-family house, but many can be found between $500,000 and $650,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Vibe</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Takoma Park is known as Azalea City because of the botanical work of one of its leading citizens, Benjamin Y. Morrison (1891 to 1966). Mr. Morrison was the first director of the United States National Arboretum, and his azalea hybrids can be found throughout town, including in the gardens of the 1884 Thomas-Siegler House, the first house built in Takoma Park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Community magnets include the city's 1911 Takoma Park Neighborhood Library, which was renovated in 2009; a Sunday farmer's market in the business district on Laurel Avenue; and the paved Sligo Creek Stream Valley Trail, which passes through 10.2 miles of Montgomery County.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Schools</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Takoma Park Elementary School, at 7511 Holly Avenue, has 703 students, prekindergarten through Grade 2. The student-teacher ratio is 13.4 to 1.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Benjamin Franklin Gilbert, a real estate developer, founded Takoma Park in 1883 to give middle-class Washingtonians a healthful place to live within commuting distance of the city. The property spanned a state border and became divided with the 1890 incorporation of Takoma Park into Maryland, resulting in the two neighboring communities, Takoma and Takoma Park, that exist today. The name ''Takoma'' (originally, ''Tacoma,'' but changed a year later at the request of the post office, to avoid confusion with the city in Washington State) was derived from the Native American name for Mount Rainier and believed to mean ''high up'' or ''near heaven.'' (Takoma Park is only 300 feet above sea level, but that was considered elevated compared with swampy Washington, D.C.)</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MIAMI -- Real estate agents looking to sell coastal properties usually focus on one thing: how close the home is to the water's edge. But buyers are increasingly asking instead how far back it is from the waterline. How many feet above sea level? Is it fortified against storm surges? Does it have emergency power and sump pumps?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising sea levels are changing the way people think about waterfront real estate. Though demand remains strong and developers continue to build near the water in many coastal cities, homeowners across the nation are slowly growing wary of buying property in areas most vulnerable to the effects of climate change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A warming planet has already forced a number of industries -- coal, oil, agriculture and utilities among them -- to account for potential future costs of a changed climate. The real estate industry, particularly along the vulnerable coastlines, is slowly awakening to the need to factor in the risks of catastrophic damage from climate change, including that wrought by rising seas and storm-driven flooding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many economists say that this reckoning needs to happen much faster and that home buyers urgently need to be better informed. Some analysts say the economic impact of a collapse in the waterfront property market could surpass that of the bursting dot-com and real estate bubbles of 2000 and 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fallout would be felt by property owners, developers, real estate lenders and the financial institutions that bundle and resell mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past five years, home sales in flood-prone areas grew about 25 percent less quickly than in counties that do not typically flood, according to county-by-county data from Attom Data Solutions, the parent company of RealtyTrac. Many coastal residents are rethinking their investments and heading for safer ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't see how this town is going to defeat the water,'' said Brent Dixon, a resident of Miami Beach who plans to move north and away from the coast in anticipation of worsening king tides, the highest predicted tide of the year. ''The water always wins.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These concerns have taken on a new urgency since the presidential election of Donald J. Trump, who has long been a skeptic of global warming, claiming in 2012 that it was a concept ''created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing noncompetitive.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A real estate developer, Mr. Trump is also the owner of several South Florida properties, including Mar-a-Lago, a 20-acre site that stretches between the Atlantic Ocean and the Intracoastal Waterway in Palm Beach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trump's recent selection of Myron Ebell to lead his <span class="companylink">Environmental Protection Agency</span> transition team intensified these worries in Florida and among many climate scientists. Mr. Ebell has helped lead the charge against the scientific consensus that global warming exists and is caused by people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">State lawmakers in Massachusetts and New Jersey are pushing to impose new rules on real estate agents and others, obligating them to disclose climate-related damage like previous flooding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks and insurers need to protect their collateral and investors more by improving their methods for estimating climate-change risks and creating more standardized rules for reporting them publicly, economists warn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April, Sean Becketti, the chief economist for Freddie Mac, the government-backed mortgage giant, issued a dire prediction. It is only a matter of time, he wrote, before sea level rise and storm surges become so unbearable along the coast that people will leave, ditching their mortgages and potentially triggering another housing meltdown -- except this time, it would be unlikely that these housing prices would ever recover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Some residents will cash out early and suffer minimal losses,'' he wrote. ''Others will not be so lucky.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bull's-Eye for Property Damage</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the uncertainty surrounding climate change focuses on the pace of the rise in sea levels. But some argue that this misses the point because property values will probably go under water long before the properties themselves do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is often called ''nuisance'' flooding -- inundation caused more by tides than weather -- is already affecting property values. Often just a foot or two deep, this type of flooding can stop traffic, swamp basements, damage cars and contaminate groundwater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Florida has six of the 10 American urban centers most vulnerable to storm surge, according to a 2016 report from <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>, a real estate data firm. Southeast Florida experiences about 10 tidal floods per year now. That number is likely to be around 240 floods per year by 2045, according to climate researchers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past year, home sales have increased 2.6 percent nationally, but have dropped about 7.6 percent in high-risk flood zones in Miami-Dade County, according to housing data. Many coastal cities are taking steps toward mitigation, digging runoff tunnels, elevating roads and building detention ponds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Murley, Miami-Dade's chief resilience officer, said it was important to avoid spooking the market since real estate investment produces much of the revenue that pays for these upgrades. This balancing act is especially important in Florida because the state and localities rely heavily on property and sales taxes for funding such projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Florida is not alone. Forty percent of Americans live and work in coastal areas, and those who can afford it are protecting their investments by building private bulkheads and lifting their homes onto stilts. But skeptics question the logic of upgrading individual properties if the surrounding areas do not keep pace and flooding or the rise in sea levels swamps nearby roads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many home buyers and owners, the cost of flood insurance is a growing worry. As premiums rise, property values fall, a trend already hurting home prices in places like Atlantic City, Norfolk, Va., and St. Petersburg, Fla., according to local real estate agents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Roy and Carol Baker, who now live in Sarasota, Fla., recalled trying for several months to sell their home in nearby Siesta Key in 2014. Interested buyers kept backing out of the purchase when they found out that the annual flood insurance premium was roughly $7,000, they said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This experience will become more common, economists say, as the federal government shifts away from subsidizing flood insurance rates to get premiums closer to reflecting the true market cost of the risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As difficult as it is to predict the pace of climate change, modeling how it will affect the real estate market is even more complicated. Like a game of hot potato, builders, homeowners, banks, flood insurers and buyers of securitized mortgages try to hand off risky properties before getting burned. Developers erect houses and sell them typically within a couple of years, long before their investments depreciate. Banks earn commissions even on risky home loans before bundling these mortgages into securities and selling them to large pension funds, insurers or other buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home buyers tend to think short term, focus on what they can afford and hope that the local infrastructure keeps pace with the rise in sea levels. Home buyers are also generally on their own as they look at prospective properties and try to size up their risk, as real estate agents vary in what they disclose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most real estate agents say they try to tackle the issue head-on, providing clients with maps indicating federally declared high-risk flood zones, and using climate-change preparedness as a selling point, emphasizing if the house has a backup generator or shingles that can withstand hurricane-strength winds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But real estate agents risk putting themselves at a competitive disadvantage by overstating threats. Good information is hard to come by. No one knows whether, when or by how much properties will depreciate, seas will encroach or flood insurance policies will change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Valerie Amor, a real estate agent in Fort Lauderdale, said that, unlike most in her industry, she does a feasibility study before she assists in either buying or selling property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It should not be left as a moral or personal decision,'' said Ms. Amor, adding that more disclosure should be mandatory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Disclosing Natural Disasters</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Norfolk is a city surrounded by water. In 2014, the <span class="companylink">Federal Emergency Management Agency</span> expanded the area designated as highest risk for a flood in an update to regional maps, requiring thousands of new homeowners to have flood insurance. The real estate industry worried about the impact on the market. Lawmakers responded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The region around Norfolk has among the highest rates of annual sea level rise on the East Coast. Rising water and sinking land could push the relative sea level up in some parts by six feet by the end of the century, the <span class="companylink">United States Army Corps of Engineers</span> estimates. Flood insurance in moderate- to low-risk areas nationally costs more than $200 a year, according to the National Flood Insurance Program, but for properties in flood zones, those rates could rise by as much as several thousand dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Virginia requires real estate agents to reveal whether a property is in a military airplane noise zone, has defective drywall or has ever been used to manufacture methamphetamine. After the flood maps were updated, the industry wondered what new disclosure rules would be mandated. Should homeowners or their agents be required to reveal to potential buyers if the house had been flooded? Should they have to tell how much flood insurance cost and was estimated to rise?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within a year, state lawmakers passed a real estate disclosure law that the industry hailed as a major step forward. ''We are immensely satisfied,'' Deborah Baisden, then president of the Virginia Association of Realtors, said of the law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the law encourages home buyers to exert due diligence in investigating the risk of living in a flood hazard area, it also explicitly states that the seller of a home is not obligated to disclose whether the home is in a zone that FEMA regards as high risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some city officials said the law did not go far enough. ''It's a nondisclosure disclosure,'' Meg Pittenger, an environmental manager for the city of Portsmouth, Va., told a reporter for The Virginian-Pilot. She added that it should have required sellers or agents to inform prospective buyers whether a property lies in a flood zone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flood risks are easily overlooked because past flood damage often goes unreported and, as in Virginia, the burden of discovering it falls to the buyer. LexisNexis, a news and legal research company, can supply sellers a report with the history of flood claims on the property, but buyers usually do not know to ask for it. FEMA collects information on federal insurance claims for homes nationally, but the agency has been reluctant to make it public for privacy reasons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">States and local real estate agents are handling disclosure differently. In Florida, real estate agents have to notify purchasers if a property is subject to natural hazards, but the law applies only to a limited area along the Florida coast and has no penalties for noncompliance. And in 2010 lawmakers stripped the requirement to disclose a property's windstorm mitigation rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California, Washington and Pennsylvania, on the other hand, require the disclosure of past flooding or susceptibility to future flooding. In New York, sellers are required to disclose whether a property sits in a flood plain. ''It may be a matter of life and death,'' said State Senator Stewart Greenleaf of Pennsylvania, who sponsored a state disclosure rule that became law this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some real estate agents around Boston have begun taking prospective buyers to newly repaired multimillion-dollar sea walls built to protect homes from storm damage. They also have begun to encourage clients to increase the marketability of their properties by installing storm-resistant technology, including steel beams and window flaps that allow water to flow in and out of a basement during a flood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not everyone favors more disclosure, said Daren Blomquist, the senior vice president of communications at Attom Data Solutions, the real estate data tracking firm that serves brokers, lenders and insurers. After strong objections from real estate companies, which threatened to stop providing data, his firm took down its web page that integrated real estate listings with plot-by-plot information about the risks of floods, hurricanes, wildfires and other natural hazards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The pressure was intense,'' he said, adding that the company still provides this information on separate web pages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks and Insurers Try to Adapt</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not just property owners, buyers and sellers who are struggling to estimate the potential financial impact of climate change on the real estate market. These risks compound as individual mortgages get bundled and sold as securities. In his April report, Mr. Becketti, the Freddie Mac economist, emphasized how difficult it was to predict whether the bubble in coastal real estate would slowly deflate or suddenly pop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Will the value of the house decline gradually as the expected life of the house becomes shorter?'' he wrote. ''Or, alternatively, will the value of the house -- and all the houses around it -- plunge the first time a lender refuses to make a mortgage on a nearby house or an insurer refuses to issue a homeowner's policy?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real estate and mortgage markets have been slow to confront climate change, said Albert Slap, an environmental lawyer and the president of Coastal Risk Consulting, a company that advises communities on how to prepare for sea level rise. Most buyers of securities, for example, underestimate the risk in their portfolios by relying on FEMA flood maps, he said. Strictly backward looking, these maps are based on floods that have already occurred.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To make matters worse, the National Flood Insurance Program is more than $20 billion in debt. After several major coastal storms, Congress tried to fix the program, passing a law in 2012 requiring that insurance premiums be recalculated to accurately reflect risk. Coastal homeowners rebelled, arguing that the legislation made insurance unaffordable, and in 2014 Congress repealed parts of the law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">George Kasimos, a real estate expert in Toms River, N.J., said homeowners had good reason to react. ''A homeowner may be approved for a $300,000 mortgage with a $3,000 a year flood insurance premium,'' he said, but the same person's loan application would most likely be rejected with a $10,000 flood insurance premium. As insurance prices rise, some home purchases will become cash only, squeezing more middle-class and lower-income buyers out of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The North Carolina shore has been especially popular among baby boomers along the East Coast looking for an affordable retirement option.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Jacobs, 54, said he expected that his home -- about 50 feet from the water in Wrightsville Beach, N.C. -- will be washed away soon enough. ''It pains me to think my children and grandchildren may not be able to enjoy it,'' he said, adding that his flood insurance is now about $400 more per month than it was when he moved there in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists have also called for reporting rules so securities investors would know what portion of their bundled mortgages includes high risk from climate change, like properties in coastal regions, river flood plains, flammable canyons and mountainsides, earthquake zones, tsunami washout zones and tornado alleys.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Coastal mortgages are growing into as big a bubble as the housing market of 2007,'' said Philip Stoddard, the mayor of South Miami. But this time, he said, there will not be a rebound because the waters will not recede and properties will eventually lose all of their value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Politicians are more focused on keeping developers calm and reassuring people that technological solutions will save the day, he said, which plays into an expectation, especially among the wealthiest homeowners, that the government will bail them out if property values crash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Riding Out the Storm</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coastal homeowners are reluctant to leave. Robert Meyer, the co-director of the Risk Management and Decision Processes Center at the <span class="companylink">Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania</span>, has been using web surveys to assess the willingness of South Florida residents to pay higher taxes for climate-change upgrades rather than move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They show a remarkable willingness to stick it out,'' Mr. Meyer said. His study found that by 2050 people would still be living in the riskiest areas and would have incrementally paid billions of dollars for adaptation measures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the slowdown in home sales, many flood-prone cities are still growing. Skyscrapers and new apartment buildings are going up all around Fort Lauderdale. The local chamber of commerce says the city expects to add about 50,000 people in the next 15 years and currently lacks housing to accommodate them. In Miami, much of the new construction consists of luxury condos aimed at a large number of cash buyers from Russia and Latin America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, median home prices in areas at high risk for flooding are still 4.4 percent below what they were 10 years ago, while home prices in low-risk areas are up 29.7 percent over the same period, according to the housing data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chris Bergh, the South Florida conservation director at <span class="companylink">the Nature Conservancy</span>, said he was worried because his house on Big Pine Key was just over a half-mile from the beach and only about five feet above sea level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In planning for my 7-year-old child's future,'' he said, ''I can't count on him inheriting a valuable piece of property on Big Pine Key.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDWhen Jared Rutledge called his mortgage broker one morning last week after putting in an offer on a home in Glendale, Ariz., just west of Phoenix, he discovered that the 3.8 percent rate he had been quoted a couple of months ago had already gone up to 4.125 percent. That afternoon, it had inched up to 4.25, and by evening, when he finally called back to finalize the deal, it was 4.375 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was kind of frustrated,'' Mr. Rutledge said. But with a third child on the way, and a buyer for their current home, he and his wife felt they had little choice. ''Instead of holding out and waiting, we locked it in,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the election, mortgage rates have climbed roughly half a percentage point to a 16-month high, adding hundreds, sometimes thousands, of dollars to a home buyer's yearly payments. (The annual cost of a $400,000 mortgage, for example, rose almost $700.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The speed and size of the increase took many lenders and borrowers by surprise -- and the increase is expected to reverberate across the housing industry, particularly if rates continue to rise next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Anybody who was floating or didn't lock in a rate is screaming at their lender: 'How could you do this to me?''' said Guy D. Cecala, chief executive and publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance. ''It shot up from 3.5 to 4 percent virtually overnight,'' he said, referring to the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Does it give people pause? Does it raise the cost of buying a home?'' Mr. Cecala asked. ''Yes and yes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For most of this year, American home buyers have benefited from weakness in the global economy. China has been struggling to sustain the rapid growth it needs to avoid political unrest, a deep recession followed political turmoil in Brazil, and a cloud of uncertainty hangs over Europe after Britain's vote to leave the <span class="companylink">European Union</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those factors, on top of efforts by central banks around the world to stimulate economic activity by keeping short-term interest rates low, have increased demand for safe American assets like government bonds and mortgage-backed securities. The result: The cost for American businesses and consumers to borrow had, until recently, remained exceptionally low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The turnaround, which was driven by postelection market expectations that a President Trump would lift corporate profits, cut taxes and spend money on infrastructure and roads, caught most experts by surprise. The online real estate brokerage Redfin, for example, had initially forecast that rates for 30-year fixed mortgages would remain below 4 percent through next year, said Glenn Kelman, the company's chief executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Redfin has now updated its forecast and is predicting the 30-year mortgage rate will pass the 4 percent threshold. ''I think you're going to see higher rates than we otherwise would have,'' Mr. Kelman said, ''but more economic stimulus.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street is also expecting that the Federal Reserve Bank will increase its benchmark interest rate when it meets next month. That rate -- the cost that banks and depository institutions charge one another for overnight loans -- has only an indirect impact on mortgage rates. Last December, for instance, after the Fed raised rates by a quarter of a percentage point, mortgage rates went down. But to the extent it reflects the Fed's confidence in an improving economic outlook, it could signal higher borrowing costs in the months ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, said Svenja Gudell, chief economist at Zillow, a real estate data provider, the relatively modest increase in mortgage rates should not have much impact on the current housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Most consumers don't make decisions based on a change in mortgage rates,'' Ms. Gudell said. ''We're dealing with such a tight inventory, I think they're more focused on finding a home that they can afford. If mortgage rates go up by half a percent, that's not going to make them change their minds.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> reported existing home sales rose 2 percent at a seasonally adjusted annualized rate in October, its strongest pace since February 2007, before the recession started.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back then, the average 30-year fixed rate mortgage topped 6 percent, a reminder that even with the recent rate jump, mortgages remain a bargain by historical standards. Thirty years ago, the average rate was about 10 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, for buyers who had been counting on paying less than 3.5 percent, the postelection bump represents an unwelcome added cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last couple of weeks, requests for refinancing have dropped, according to Gregory Gwizdz, national sales manager of Wells Fargo Home Lending, one of the nation's largest home loan originators. He expects that trend to continue through next year as rates stay at this level or inch higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although he hasn't seen any impact on home buying in the last two weeks, Mr. Gwizdz said that rate increases ''create some sense of urgency.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If people believe rates are on the rise,'' he said, ''they may try to find that home sooner rather than later.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher rates are often followed by a burst of activity from consumers worried about further increases. But Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said he had not seen evidence of pent-up demand. He thinks housing activity is heading for a fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even before this latest bump in rates, he was concerned about a drop in mortgage applications. Mortgage standards have tightened this year, he said, making it more difficult for buyers to qualify despite the steady uptick in wages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Even if applications don't go down further,'' Mr. Shepherdson said, ''we are looking at a significant drop in home sales in the first quarter of next year.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For those looking to purchase a home, different types of loans may become more appealing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers of new construction, who have to wait months for their homes to be completed, may be willing to pay a little more to lock in a lower rate for an extended period of time, Mr. Gwizdz said. Those who plan to move again in the next few years might be more likely to consider an adjustable-rate mortgage than before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Westchester County, north of New York City, J. Philip Faranda, a real estate broker, said that buyers often had differing motivations, with some focused on the investment prospects and others guided by nonmonetary factors. ''If you're expecting twins, you're buying now no matter what the interest rates are,'' he said. ''If you're setting a date for your wedding, you may be putting that on hold.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bic N. DeCaro, a real estate agent in Northern Virginia, said that before the election most clients had been dragging their feet, uncertain about what to do. But since rates started to move up, ''there was a flurry of activity,'' she said, leading to more showings and two signed contracts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Phoenix, Luis Solis, a real estate broker, said some of his clients have also ramped up their searches in the past week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People are afraid they are going to go up really fast,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As it turns out, Mr. Solis is in the midst of buying a larger house for his own family in Phoenix's central corridor. ''We were lucky that we locked in our rate on November 1,'' he said. ''Rates have really jumped.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: November 30, 2016, Wednesday</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MIAMI — Real estate agents looking to sell coastal properties usually focus on one thing: how close the home is to the water’s edge. But buyers are increasingly asking instead how far back it is from the waterline. How many feet above sea level? Is it fortified against storm surges? Does it have emergency power and sump pumps?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising sea levels are changing the way people think about waterfront real estate. Though demand remains strong and developers continue to build near the water in many coastal cities, homeowners across the nation are slowly growing wary of buying property in areas most vulnerable to the effects of climate change[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/globalwarming/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A warming planet[http://www.nytimes.com/topic/subject/global-warming-climate-change?8qa] has already forced a number of industries — coal, oil, agriculture and utilities among them — to account for potential future costs of a changed climate. The real estate industry, particularly along the vulnerable coastlines, is slowly awakening to the need to factor in the risks of catastrophic damage from climate change, including that wrought by rising seas and storm-driven flooding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many economists say that this reckoning needs to happen much faster and that home buyers urgently need to be better informed. Some analysts say the economic impact of a collapse in the waterfront property market could surpass that of the bursting dot-com and real estate bubbles of 2000 and 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fallout would be felt by property owners, developers, real estate lenders and the financial institutions that bundle and resell mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past five years, home sales in flood-prone areas grew about 25 percent less quickly than in counties that do not typically flood, according to county-by-county data from Attom Data Solutions[http://www.attomdata.com/], the parent company of RealtyTrac. Many coastal residents are rethinking their investments and heading for safer ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I don’t see how this town is going to defeat the water,” said Brent Dixon, a resident of Miami Beach who plans to move north and away from the coast in anticipation of worsening king tides[http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/18/us/intensified-by-climate-change-king-tides-change-ways-of-life-in-florida.html?_r=0], the highest predicted tide of the year. “The water always wins.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These concerns have taken on a new urgency since the presidential election of Donald J. Trump, who has long been a skeptic of global warming, claiming in 2012[https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/265895292191248385?lang=en] that it was a concept “created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing noncompetitive.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A real estate developer, Mr. Trump is also the owner of several South Florida[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/great-homes-and-destinations/destinations/south-florida/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] properties, including Mar-a-Lago, a 20-acre site that stretches between the Atlantic Ocean and the Intracoastal Waterway in Palm Beach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trump’s recent  selection of Myron Ebell[http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/12/science/myron-ebell-trump-epa.html] to lead his <span class="companylink">Environmental Protection Agency</span> transition team intensified these worries in Florida[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/classifieds/realestate/locations/florida/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] and among many climate scientists. Mr. Ebell has helped lead the charge against the scientific consensus that global warming exists and is caused by people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">State lawmakers in Massachusetts and New Jersey are pushing to impose new rules on real estate agents and others, obligating them to disclose climate-related damage like previous flooding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks and insurers need to protect their collateral and investors more by improving their methods for estimating climate-change risks and creating more standardized rules for reporting them publicly, economists warn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April, Sean Becketti, the chief economist for Freddie Mac, the government-backed mortgage giant, issued a dire prediction[http://www.freddiemac.com/finance/report/20160426_lifes_a_beach.html]. It is only a matter of time, he wrote, before sea level rise and storm surges become so unbearable along the coast that people will leave, ditching their mortgages and potentially triggering another housing meltdown — except this time, it would be unlikely that these housing prices would ever recover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Some residents will cash out early and suffer minimal losses,” he wrote. “Others will not be so lucky.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ground Zero for Property Damage</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the uncertainty surrounding climate change focuses on the pace of the rise in sea levels. But some argue that this misses the point because property values will probably go under water long before the properties themselves do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is often called “nuisance” flooding — inundation caused more by tides than weather — is already affecting property values. Often just a foot or two deep, this type of flooding can stop traffic, swamp basements, damage cars and contaminate groundwater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Florida has six of the 10 American urban centers most vulnerable to storm surge, according to a 2016 report from CoreLogic[http://www.corelogic.com/landing-pages/2016-corelogic-storm-surge-risk-report.aspx], a real estate data firm. Southeast Florida experiences about 10 tidal floods per year now. That number is likely to be around 240 floods per year by 2045, according to climate researchers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past year, home sales have increased 2.6 percent nationally, but have dropped about 7.6 percent in high-risk flood zones in Miami-Dade County, according to housing data. Many coastal cities are taking steps toward mitigation, digging runoff tunnels, elevating roads and building detention ponds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Murley, Miami-Dade’s chief resilience officer, said it was important to avoid spooking the market since real estate investment produces much of the revenue that pays for these upgrades. This balancing act is especially important in Florida because the state and localities rely heavily on property and sales taxes for funding such projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Florida is not alone. Forty percent of Americans live and work in coastal areas, and those who can afford it are protecting their investments by building private bulkheads and lifting their homes onto stilts. But skeptics question the logic of upgrading individual properties if the surrounding areas do not keep pace and flooding or the rise in sea levels swamps nearby roads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many home buyers and owners, the cost of flood insurance is a growing worry. As premiums rise, property values fall, a trend already hurting home prices in places like Atlantic City, Norfolk, Va., and St. Petersburg, Fla., according to local real estate agents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Roy and Carol Baker, who now live in Sarasota, Fla., recalled trying for several months to sell their home in nearby Siesta Key in 2014. Interested buyers kept backing out of the purchase when they found out that the annual flood insurance premium was roughly $7,000, they said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This experience will become more common, economists say, as the federal government shifts away[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/03/your-money/federal-flood-insurance-premiums-for-homeowners-rise-as-much-as-25-percent.html] from subsidizing flood insurance rates to get premiums closer to reflecting the true market cost of the risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As difficult as it is to predict the pace of climate change, modeling how it will affect the real estate market is even more complicated. Like a game of hot potato, builders, homeowners, banks, flood insurers and buyers of securitized mortgages try to hand off risky properties before getting burned. Developers erect houses and sell them typically within a couple of years, long before their investments have a chance to depreciate. Banks earn commissions even on risky home loans before bundling these mortgages into securities and selling them to large pension funds, insurers or other buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home buyers tend to think short term, focus on what they can afford and hope that the local infrastructure keeps pace with the rise in sea levels. Home buyers are also generally on their own as they look at prospective properties and try to size up their risk, as real estate agents vary in what they disclose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most real estate agents say they try to tackle the issue head-on, providing clients with maps indicating federally declared high-risk flood zones, and using climate-change preparedness as a selling point, emphasizing if the house has a backup generator or shingles that can withstand hurricane-strength winds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But real estate agents risk putting themselves at a competitive disadvantage by overstating threats. Good information is hard to come by. No one knows whether, when or by how much properties will depreciate, seas will encroach or flood insurance policies will change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Valerie Amor, a real estate agent in Fort Lauderdale, said that, unlike most in her industry, she does a feasibility study before she assists in either buying or selling property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It should not be left as a moral or personal decision,” said Ms. Amor, adding that more disclosure should be mandatory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Disclosing Natural Disasters</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Norfolk is a city surrounded by water. In 2014, the <span class="companylink">Federal Emergency Management Agency</span> expanded the area designated as highest risk for a flood in an update to regional maps, requiring thousands of new homeowners to have flood insurance. The real estate industry worried about the impact on the market. Lawmakers responded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The region around Norfolk has among the highest rates of annual sea level rise on the East Coast. Rising water and sinking land could push the relative sea level up in some parts by six feet by the end of the century, the <span class="companylink">United States Army Corps of Engineers</span> estimates. Flood insurance in moderate- to low-risk areas nationally costs more than $200 a year, according to the National Flood Insurance Program, but for properties in flood zones, those rates could rise by as much as several thousand dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Virginia requires real estate agents to reveal whether a property is in a military airplane noise zone, has defective drywall or has ever been used to manufacture methamphetamine. After the flood maps were updated, the industry wondered what new disclosure rules would be mandated. Should homeowners or their agents be required to reveal to potential buyers if the house had been flooded? Should they have to tell how much flood insurance cost and was estimated to rise?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within a year, state lawmakers passed a real estate disclosure law that the industry hailed as a major step forward. “We are immensely satisfied,” Deborah Baisden, then president of the Virginia Association of Realtors, said of the law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the law encourages home buyers to exert due diligence in investigating the risk of living in a flood hazard area, it also explicitly states that the seller of a home is not obligated to disclose whether the home is in a zone that FEMA regards as high risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some city officials said the law did not go far enough. “It’s a nondisclosure disclosure,” Meg Pittenger, an environmental manager for the city of Portsmouth, Va., told [http://pilotonline.com/news/local/environment/buyer-beware-check-if-the-property-is-in-a-flood/article_ced5780a-aadd-5db8-88aa-313017bea9aa.html]  a [http://pilotonline.com/news/local/environment/buyer-beware-check-if-the-property-is-in-a-flood/article_ced5780a-aadd-5db8-88aa-313017bea9aa.html]  reporter for The Virginian-Pilot[http://pilotonline.com/news/local/environment/buyer-beware-check-if-the-property-is-in-a-flood/article_ced5780a-aadd-5db8-88aa-313017bea9aa.html]. She added that it should have required sellers or agents to inform prospective buyers whether a property lies in a flood zone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flood risks are easily overlooked because past flood damage often goes unreported and, as in Virginia, the burden of discovering it falls to the buyer. LexisNexis, a news and legal research company, can supply sellers a report with the history of flood claims on the property, but buyers usually do not know to ask for it. FEMA collects information on federal insurance claims for homes nationally, but the agency has been reluctant to make it public for privacy reasons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">States and local real estate agents are handling disclosure differently. In Florida, real estate agents have to notify purchasers if a property is subject to natural hazards, but the law applies only to a limited area along the Florida coast and has no penalties for noncompliance. And in 2010 lawmakers stripped the requirement to disclose a property’s windstorm mitigation rating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California, Washington and Pennsylvania, on the other hand, require the disclosure of past flooding or susceptibility to future flooding. In New York, sellers are required to disclose whether a property sits in a flood plain. “It may be a matter of life and death,” said State Senator Stewart Greenleaf of Pennsylvania, who sponsored a state disclosure rule that became law this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some real estate agents around Boston have begun taking prospective buyers to newly repaired multimillion-dollar sea walls built to protect homes from storm damage. They also have begun to encourage clients to increase the marketability of their properties by installing storm-resistant technology, including steel beams and window flaps that allow water to flow in and out of a basement during a flood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not everyone favors more disclosure, said Daren Blomquist, the senior vice president of communications at Attom Data Solutions, the real estate data tracking firm that serves brokers, lenders and insurers. After strong objections from real estate companies, which threatened to stop providing data, his firm took down its web page that integrated real estate listings with plot-by-plot information about the risks of floods, hurricanes, wildfires and other natural hazards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The pressure was intense,” he said, adding that the company still provides this information on separate web pages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks and Insurers Struggle to Adjust</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not just property owners, buyers and sellers who are struggling to estimate the potential financial impact of climate change on the real estate market. These risks compound as individual mortgages get bundled and sold as securities. In his April report, Mr. Becketti, the Freddie Mac economist, emphasized how difficult it was to predict whether the bubble in coastal real estate would slowly deflate slowly or suddenly pop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Will the value of the house decline gradually as the expected life of the house becomes shorter?” he wrote. “Or, alternatively, will the value of the house — and all the houses around it — plunge the first time a lender refuses to make a mortgage on a nearby house or an insurer refuses to issue a homeowner’s policy?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real estate and mortgage markets have been slow to confront climate change, said Albert Slap, an environmental lawyer and the president of Coastal Risk Consulting[http://coastalriskconsulting.com/], a company that advises communities on how to prepare for sea level rise. Most buyers of securities, for example, underestimate the risk in their portfolios by relying on FEMA flood maps, he said. Strictly backward looking, these maps are based on floods that have already occurred.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To make matters worse, the National Flood Insurance Program is more than $20 billion in debt. After several major coastal storms, Congress tried to fix the program, passing a law in 2012 requiring that insurance premiums be recalculated to accurately reflect risk. Coastal homeowners rebelled, arguing that the legislation made insurance unaffordable, and in 2014 Congress repealed parts of the law[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/29/us/politics/popular-flood-insurance-law-is-target-of-both-political-parties.html?ref=topics].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">George Kasimos, a real estate expert in Toms River, N.J., said homeowners had good reason to react. “A homeowner may be approved for a $300,000 mortgage with a $3,000 a year flood insurance premium,” he said, but the same person’s loan application would most likely be rejected with a $10,000 flood insurance premium. As insurance prices rise, some home purchases will become cash only, squeezing more middle-class and lower-income buyers out of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The North Carolina shore has been especially popular among baby boomers along the East Coast looking for an affordable retirement option.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Jacobs, 54, said he expected that his home — about 50 feet from the water in Wrightsville Beach, N.C. — will be washed away soon enough. “It pains me to think my children and grandchildren may not be able to enjoy it,” he said, adding that his flood insurance is now about $400 more per month than it was when he moved there in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists have also called for reporting rules so securities investors would know what portion of their bundled mortgages include high risk from climate change, like properties in coastal regions, river flood plains, flammable canyons and mountainsides, earthquake zones, tsunami washout zones and tornado alleys.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Coastal mortgages are growing into as big a bubble as the housing market of 2007,” said Philip Stoddard, the mayor of South Miami. But this time, he said, there will not be a rebound because the waters will not recede and properties will eventually lose all of their value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Politicians are more focused on keeping developers calm and reassuring people that technological solutions will save the day, he said, which plays into an expectation, especially among the wealthiest homeowners, that the government will bail them out if property values crash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Riding Out the Storm</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coastal homeowners are reluctant to leave. Robert Meyer, the co-director of the Risk Management and Decision Processes Center at the <span class="companylink">Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania</span>, has been using web surveys to assess the willingness of South Florida residents to pay higher taxes for climate-change upgrades rather than relocate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They show a remarkable willingness to stick it out,” Mr. Meyer said. His study found that by 2050 people would still be living in the riskiest areas and would have incrementally paid billions of dollars for adaptation measures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the slowdown in home sales, many flood-prone cities are still growing. Skyscrapers and new apartment buildings are going up all around Fort Lauderdale. The local chamber of commerce says the city expects to add about 50,000 people in the next 15 years and currently lacks housing to accommodate them. In Miami, much of the new construction consists of luxury condos aimed at a large number of cash buyers from Russia and Latin America.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, median home prices in areas at high risk for flooding are still 4.4 percent below what they were 10 years ago, while home prices in low-risk areas are up 29.7 percent over the same period, according to the housing data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chris Bergh, the South Florida conservation director at <span class="companylink">the Nature Conservancy</span>, said he was worried because his house on Big Pine Key is just over a half-mile from the beach and only about five feet above sea level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In planning for my 7-year-old child’s future,” he said, “I can’t count on him inheriting a valuable piece of property on Big Pine Key.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a modest house, a two-bedroom ranch in Arlington, Mass. Jerri and Richard Newman had to stretch to buy it for $169,000 in 1996, but with his job at Boston's Museum of Fine Arts and her freelance editing, they figured they could swing it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They took out a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage. But their son developed mental health disabilities, including a bipolar disorder. To pay for his care, and help compensate for Ms. Newman's interrupted career, the Newmans refinanced four times and took out a home-equity loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an earlier era, the Newmans -- he's 65; she's 62 -- might now be contemplating retirement in a paid-for home. Instead, they've amassed so much mortgage debt, about $375,000, that they're reluctantly considering selling. ''We tried for years to catch up,'' Ms. Newman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The norm for a long time was, if you bought a house at 35 and didn't refinance, you'd be done paying for it by retirement,'' said Geoffrey Sanzenbacher, a research economist at the Center for Retirement Research at <span class="companylink">Boston College</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amid the continuing fallout from the housing boom and bust, however, a growing proportion of older homeowners now carries mortgage debt. And the average amount keeps rising, according to two recent studies, which may portend lower standards of living for many retirees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than three-quarters of Americans over 65 remain homeowners despite housing market gyrations. Those houses usually represent their greatest single asset.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But often there's little equity left, even as prices have largely recovered, because so many older homeowners have borrowed against their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As housing values rose more than 60 percent nationally between 2000 and 2006, homeowners like the Newmans (more than younger ones) refinanced and took out cash, or signed up for home equity loans or lines of credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proportion of homeowners over 55 with housing debt has climbed, the <span class="companylink">Boston College</span> group recently reported. Dr. Sanzenbacher provided the numbers: 50 percent still had mortgages, home equity loans or lines of credit in 2013, compared with 38 percent in 1998.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An <span class="companylink">Urban Institute</span> study published this month, based on data from the national Health and Retirement Study, found a similar pattern among homeowners over 65. The proportion with housing debt rose to 35 percent in 2012 from 23.9 percent in 1998.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, the median amount they owed nearly doubled, to $82,000 from $44,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tapping home equity ''was an attractive opportunity,'' Dr. Sanzenbacher said. ''If you assumed housing prices would keep going up, it didn't seem very risky.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, cultural attitudes about owing money shifted, said Barbara Butrica, an economist and co-author of the <span class="companylink">Urban Institute</span> report. ''It used to be a stigma to have debt,'' she said. ''Now everyone has debt.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let's not overlook the role of banks and other lenders, either. ''Financial institutions were very opportunistic,'' Dr. Butrica said. ''They made it easy to refinance or take out a home-equity loan or line of credit.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing prices didn't keep rising, of course. After they plummeted, would-be retirees confronted the prospect of years during which salaries would stop, but monthly mortgage payments wouldn't.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of these households face a precarious financial future. In 1998, less than 3 percent of homeowners over 65 were ''underwater,'' with housing debt that exceeded the value of their homes, the <span class="companylink">Urban Institute</span> analysis found. By 2012, that proportion topped 8 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The institute also looked at older homeowners with loan-to-value ratios of 80 percent or more, meaning that their debts had reached 80 percent of their home values, often a point at which banks won't approve loans, charge higher interest rates or require mortgage insurance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1998, 8.4 percent of older homeowners had reached an 80 percent ratio. In 2012, 19.5 percent had. ''If you think of 80 percent as the threshold for being at risk of default, it's pretty dramatic,'' Dr. Butrica said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her study also found that health events or work-limiting conditions, like those the Newmans experienced, correlate with higher rates of home equity borrowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing debt can have the greatest impact on the middle class, Dr. Sanzenbacher said. Lower-income retirees are less likely to own homes, and the wealthy rely less on home equity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for most retirees, even if they don't tap their equity initially, a paid-for house represents security. They can live rent free (though, of course, they still pay property taxes, utilities and maintenance), or they can sell the house to finance a move to a retirement community or a nursing home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Sanzenbacher and his colleagues calculate a National Retirement Risk Index, which indicates how many working-age households may be unable to sustain their standards of living after they stop working.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's always a scary number: 30 percent in 1989, rising into the 40 percent range during the boom and bust. In 2013, given longer life expectancies, historically low interest rates and lower home equity, the figure reached 52 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's unclear, economists say, is whether this debt crunch will turn out to be a one-time phenomenon. Is it a consequence of an imploding housing market that will not recur, or an ongoing reality that now must be factored into most Americans' retirement planning?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Butrica votes for the latter. The rise in housing debt predated the recession, she pointed out. Even if that debt levels off, as recent data suggest, she doesn't see it going away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her work has shown that older people with mortgage debt tend to stay in the labor force longer, and to delay receiving Social Security benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Newmans are likely to be among them. Mr. Newman intends to stay in his job as long as possible; he likes his work and also hopes to rebuild his employee retirement savings. ''We're in better shape than a lot of people,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's particularly true for black and Hispanic homeowners and those with high school diplomas. They're more apt to be overextended, at the 80 percent loan-to-value mark, than whites, the college educated or upper-income households.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Newmans, living frugally and trying everything from a mortgage modification (they didn't qualify) to an interest-only arrangement (it helped, but lasted only two years) remain stuck with an 8 percent mortgage, twice the rate many local lenders offer. But they don't want to default.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The solution would be refinancing at a reasonable rate,'' Mr. Newman said. ''But because of our history and our credit rating, we don't qualify.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Meaghan Hannan Davant, Capitol Hill is not the throbbing, recently convulsed heart of political power in Washington, D.C., but an unpretentious small town. ''People don't wear makeup,'' said Ms. Davant, a 39-year-old lawyer, who has been living in the Capitol Hill Historic District since 2006. ''They wear yoga pants and drive Honda Odysseys. We do walk down the streets and see the newscasters and senators, but they're in their sweatpants, just like us.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neighboring the <span class="companylink">United States Congress</span> and the Supreme Court, the historic district is where monumental, white-stone Washington intersects with a quirky, lush village. Victorian houses send up peaks like flares, outdoor cafes hum with gossip and baby strollers seem as plentiful as business suits. Like the Capitol dome, which has a habit of popping up when you turn a corner, government is frequently in the foreground, but coexists with a larger, more diverse landscape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Davant typifies this neighborly relationship. She and her husband, Charles, and their two children live in a 3,092-square-foot 1895 house at 606 Massachusetts Avenue NE, which they bought in 2013 for almost $1.5 million. They rent their English basement to a congressional staffer for $1,850 a month, including utilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a common neighborhood practice. The extra income is welcome for homeowners shouldering the cost of expensive housing. For the year through Nov. 16, the median sales price of homes on Capitol Hill was $684,500, an increase of 6 percent over the previous year, according to the real estate information website Homesnap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These arrangements also provide young people, many working at lower-rung government jobs, with an affordable place for the short term -- a rarity for the area. In the historic district, which encompasses around 200 city squares, rental buildings are scarce. An exception is 700 Penn, a mixed-use development at 700 Pennsylvania Avenue SE, formerly occupied by Hine Junior High School. After six years of legal challenges from community members who objected to the size, the project is set to open next year with 162 affordable and market-rate rental apartments, 60,000 square feet of retail space and 150,000 square feet of office space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other new housing in the scrupulously preserved area takes the form of adaptive reuse. The Sanctuary, a renovated 1897 Gothic Revival church and adjoining townhouse at 819 D Street NE, began selling its 30 condominiums in June; the building is now 75 percent sold. The project is one of two recent church conversions on Capitol Hill currently marketed by Urban Pace, a real estate sales and marketing firm that focuses on new development. Matt Dewey, the company's president, described a trend of local churches following their congregations to the suburbs and selling their buildings to finance properties in the new locations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What You'll Find</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the ever-growing boundaries of Capitol Hill are disputed, the historic district is clearly defined. As designated by the District of Columbia's Historic Preservation Review Board, which revised the map last year, it touches H Street NE to the north, 14th Street SE to the east, M Street SE to the south and South Capitol Street SE to the west.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the area's roughly 8,000 buildings are houses with bay fronts, turrets, stepped Flemish parapets, Moorish balconies, gothic arches, dormers and many other features, sometimes in curious combinations. Judith Capen, an architect on a mission to catalog the various styles for the Capitol Hill Restoration Society, noted in a society pamphlet: ''The defiance of style labels of so many of Capitol Hill's buildings should be seen as a celebration of diversity and not as a source of frustration.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What You'll Pay</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of Nov. 17, 46 Capitol Hill Historic District listings from multiple brokers were featured on DC Condo Boutique's website. They ranged in price from a one-bedroom one-bath 585-square-foot condominium in a 1927 building at 115 D Street SE, listed at $379,000, to a seven-bedroom eight-bath newly built house with a two-bedroom one-and-a-half-bath 1877 guesthouse at 612 Third Street SE, listed at $2.85 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lee Murphy, a saleswoman at <span class="companylink">Washington Fine Properties</span>, said it was too soon to see ripples in the local real estate market from the changing administration; she expects robust activity by the spring. If, as seems likely, President-elect Donald J. Trump brings outsiders to Washington, Ms. Murphy predicts that the newcomers will buy homes on Capitol Hill and in other areas, given the low interest rates and the city's high rental prices. She and Mr. Dewey of Urban Pace both said they had had at least one prospective buyer who had anticipated working for a Democratic administration and had backed out of a deal after Mr. Trump's victory. Ms. Murphy was not sympathetic. ''Really, you do need to solidify your job before you start looking for houses,'' she said. ''Maybe I'm old-fashioned.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Vibe</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Capitol Hill is beloved for its walkability, parks, commercial corridors with good restaurants (including the revitalized Barracks Row, along Eighth Street SE, south from Pennsylvania SE to the Washington Navy Yard) and Eastern Market, a 143-year-old site for local food vendors at 225 Seventh Street SE.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Larry Janezich, a Capitol Hill resident for 50 years who edits Capitol Hill Corner, a news website, praised the neighborhood's two Carnegie libraries and pair of independent bookstores, its network of community gardens, its weekend flea market near Eastern Market and its Historic Congressional Cemetery, which allows dogs to walk off leash on more than 35 fenced acres. (This is a membership program with a wait list and costs $275 to $375 annually, depending on the number of dogs you sign up.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Janezich also noted that parking is a neighborhood concern, especially with 2,000 new apartments expected on the market in the larger Capitol Hill area in the next two years, many in buildings without provisions for cars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Schools</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The neighborhood public schools are ''improving dramatically,'' said Ivan Frishberg, a vice president of Amalgamated Bank, who was an advisory neighborhood commissioner on Capitol Hill from 2010 to 2014. But most of the strides are being made at the elementary school level, he added, while middle schools are lagging . ''We don't have one core Capitol Hill middle school,'' he said. ''And because of the kind of chaotic nature of charter schools popping up all over the place, the school population after elementary school gets spread out everywhere. It is a detriment to making neighborhood schools work.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brent Elementary School, at 301 North Carolina Avenue SE, a public school considered one of the best in the neighborhood, has 384 students, prekindergarten through fifth grade. On 2015-16 state standardized tests, 61 percent of students met standards in English, versus 28 percent in the District of Columbia over all, according to District of Columbia Public Schools data; 61 percent met standards in math, versus 33 percent districtwide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stuart-Hobson Middle School, at 410 E Street NE, has 424 students, Grades 6 through 8. On 2015-16 state standardized tests, 24 percent of students met standards in English, versus 27 percent in the District of Columbia; 11 percent met standards in math, versus 20 percent districtwide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two Rivers Public Charter School, at 1227 Fourth Street NE, has 526 students, prekindergarten through eighth grade. On 2015-16 state standardized tests, 43 percent of students met standards in English, versus 28 percent in the District of Columbia; 40 percent met standards in math, versus 26 percent districtwide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eastern Senior High School, at 1700 East Capitol Street NE, has 967 students in Grades 9 through 12. On 2015-16 state standardized tests, 18 percent of students met standards in English, versus 21 percent in the District of Columbia; 1 percent met standards in math, versus 11 percent districtwide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commute</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Centrally situated and highly accessible, Capitol Hill is served by the Capitol South and Eastern Market Metro stations, on the orange, silver and blue lines. The Capitol South station is two stops from L'Enfant Plaza, where five Metro lines meet, and a walk of about 15 minutes from Union Station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The History</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Capitol Hill evolved from Pierre Charles L'Enfant's 1791 plan for a ''Congress House'' to be built on Jenkins Hill, at one of the highest points in the new federal city. Two neighborhoods sprang up in the area and gradually merged. One, a group of boardinghouses, served as temporary quarters for early members of Congress; the other was a community of shipbuilders and merchants, southeast near the Navy Yard. A building boom in the 1870s brought many Victorian houses to Capitol Hill that remain neighborhood ornaments.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</span>, the nation's top consumer watchdog, is stepping up an investigation into seller-financed home sales that target lower-income home buyers unable to get a traditional mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The regulatory agency on Monday disclosed that it recently ordered two major companies that offer high-interest installment contracts called contracts for deed to comply with a civil investigative demand for documents. The request is a sign that the investigation is advancing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two firms, which challenged the demand for documents, are Harbour Portfolio Advisors of Dallas and National Asset Advisors of Columbia, S.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agency began informally looking at seller-financed homes, and specifically contracts for deed, this year. Enforcement lawyers at the agency have been investigating the prevalence of these types of transactions to determine whether they violate federal truth-in-lending laws. The agency posted the orders, signed this month, on its website on Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several recent reports, including a front-page article in The <span class="companylink">New York Times</span>, have explored a revival of these kinds of transactions and the abuses in the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harbour Portfolio bought more than 6,700 single-family homes after the financial crisis of 2008, most of them from <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, a government-controlled mortgage finance firm, through bulk sales. Harbour paid $10,000 or less for most of the homes, which were foreclosed on during the financial crisis, and sells them ''as is.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, Harbour began to sell off more than 600 homes with existing contracts for deeds in place to other investment firms and individual investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Harbour has been regulated at the state level since its inception, and it has always prided itself on following the law and treating consumers fairly,'' said a Harbour spokeswoman. ''We don't believe contracts for deed are a consumer financial product or service under the C.F.P.B.'s authority. Since these investigations are quite daunting and costly for a small organization such as our own, we thought it appropriate to exercise our right to challenge the C.F.P.B.'s basis for jurisdiction.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harbour Portfolio is represented by lawyers with Hudson Cook, a Maryland-based law firm that specializes in consumer finance regulatory matters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lawyer for National Asset said the firm stood by its legal filing sent to the agency opposing the document request.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The five-year-old regulatory agency has recently sought to flex its muscles with enforcement action -- announcing new rules this year that would prevent many financial companies from forcing consumers to resolve disputes through mandatory arbitration. It has also worked on a new set of regulations for payday loans -- which often carry high interest rates and predatory features.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet after last week's election of Donald J. Trump, the future of the regulatory agency seems more uncertain than ever.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President-elect Trump has signaled that his administration will seek to roll back some of the financial reform regulations and legislation enacted by the Obama administration after the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</span> has been a favorite target for critics in Congress and on Wall Street who contend the agency has been too aggressive and strayed from its mandate of better regulating the mortgage market by venturing into subprime auto loans, mandatory arbitration and payday lending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the investigation of contract for deed firms would seem to fall within the broad purview of the agency to oversee national standards for the mortgage market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contracts for deed and similar products -- such as rent-to-own deals for buying homes -- have become more prominent since the financial crisis because of the unavailability of smaller mortgages in urban and rural communities. These alternative deals, in which the seller retains ownership to a home until a contract is paid off, are popular in some Midwestern states hit hard by the foreclosure crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seller-financed transactions are particularly popular in Michigan and Ohio, two states that helped propel Mr. Trump to victory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RealtyTrac, a property data service, estimates that on average 20,000 homes a year have been sold nationally through contracts for deed since 2009 -- and the pace of deals has quickened since the crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it is difficult to know just how many homes are sold through contracts for deed or rent-to-own leases because not all states require such transactions to be publicly recorded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This summer, the <span class="companylink">National Consumer Law Center</span> issued a report in which it said many seller-financed deals were ''toxic,'' and were transactions that were built to fail and that had harmed consumers.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A WATERFRONT VILLA WITH A POOL</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">$2.3 MILLION</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This three-bedroom three-and-a-half-bath house sits on a two-acre waterfront lot on the eastern coast of the Caribbean island of Antigua. Behind the house is a large lawn dotted with trees, and past that, a small beach on Brown's Bay shared with neighboring homes, reached by taking a few steps and a pathway down from the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house is named Sehil Villa, said Ken Meade, the owner, for a combination of his daughter's and wife's names: Selina and Hilda. Built of concrete blocks, with a white exterior, it is surrounded by tropical plants. The living room has a ceiling trussed with pine beams and glass doors with views over Brown's Bay, Mr. Meade said; a dining area is to the right of the living room. The kitchen has Frigidaire appliances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two of the bedrooms are on the main floor and one is downstairs. Each has an en-suite bathroom, water views and access to the yard. There's also a laundry room downstairs. The house, which has air-conditioning units in each bedroom and ceiling fans throughout, is being sold furnished.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bedrooms, living room and kitchen all open onto a large terrace running along the back of the house. Parts of it are covered, including an area that accommodates a small dining table, just outside the living room. A saltwater pool is at the center of the terrace, and a gazebo is on the far left.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The interior has 1,935 square feet. Including outdoor living spaces, the total is about 3,300 square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property neighbors a small hotel with a restaurant called Harmony Hall, which can be reached by a walk on the beach or a very short drive. Nearby shopping for staples like eggs and milk is in Freetown, a village that's a three-minute drive from the property. The capital of St. John's, a 40-minute drive, has more substantial shopping as well as restaurants. An uninhabited island is accessible by a boat ride of less than 10 minutes, and one of Antigua's most celebrated beaches, Half Moon Bay, is a 10-minute drive, Mr. Meade said. The international airport is a 45-minute drive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARKET OVERVIEW</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real estate market of Antigua and Barbuda, a constitutional monarchy in the West Indies headed by Queen Elizabeth II and led by a prime minister and a parliament, is still recovering from the global housing crisis, real estate agents said. Prices are significantly lower than the peak, though buyer interest has recently increased. The country, encompassing both Barbuda and Antigua, has a population of around 90,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is very much a buyer's market,'' said Richard Watson, the owner of the Antigua real estate agency Richard Watson &amp; Company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2008, prices for all homes fell by about 40 percent, said Brad Esty, the owner and broker of Stanley's Estate Agents, which shares the listing with Seventh Heaven Properties. Today's prices are about 20 percent lower than at the peak, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luxury properties in Antigua tend to range from $1.5 million to $5 million, Mr. Esty said. It is common for properties on the international market to be priced in United States dollars, as this one is. The most expensive properties, in the Jumby Bay resort, top $20 million, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several recent changes -- including the initiation of a citizenship by investment program -- have increased demand, agents said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With growing interest from North American buyers, increasing airlift and large inflows of investment into new developments, the market is improving,'' Walter Zephirin, managing director of Seventh Heaven Properties, a luxury real estate company based in London that specializes in the Caribbean, wrote in an email.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Esty said prices, inquiries and the number of sales for all types of properties have risen since the same time last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Popular areas include Jolly Harbour, English Harbour, Jumby Bay, NonSuch Bay, Sugar Ridge, Tamarind Hills, and the residential area north of St. John's, agents said. There are also several developments underway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHO BUYS IN ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Zephirin said that recently the proportion of buyers from the United States had risen, mirroring an increase in tourism from the United States and as a result of improved air connections. <span class="companylink">JetBlue</span> started flying to Antigua nonstop from New York in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a consequence of the weaker pound following the Brexit referendum, Mr. Zephirin said he expected the share of British buyers to keep declining.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Esty said his buyers come primarily from Europe, North America and Asia. Though foreign buyers have historically used their properties as seasonal homes, an increasing number are relocating to Antigua, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">English Harbour is popular with yachters, Mr. Watson said. He added that Antigua's buyers tend to keep a lower profile than elsewhere in the Caribbean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Antigua attracts buyers who seek privacy, seclusion, and who wish to go around without being noticed,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BUYING BASICS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreigners who buy real estate in Antigua must obtain a noncitizens landholding license or be granted an Antiguan passport under the country's Citizenship by Investment Program, said Septimus A. Rhudd, the founder of Rhudd &amp; Associates, a law firm in St. John's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The license typically takes roughly three to six months to obtain, according to Nicolette M. Doherty, a lawyer with a practice in St. John's. Stamp duty on the license is 5 percent of the government assessed value of the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other closing costs paid by the buyer include a stamp duty of 2.5 percent of the government assessed value, Mr. Rhudd said. There are also land registry filing and processing fees, which he estimated at around $80 in United States currency for a $1 million home. Purchases are typically handled by a lawyer, and the cost of that service is usually 1.5 percent of the purchase price. There is a 15 percent tax on that service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rhudd said buyers should request current, dated copies of the Land Register to verify ownership of the property and confirm that the title is unencumbered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Esty said buyers and sellers should do due diligence before selecting a real estate agent, because the industry is unregulated and a license is not required.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Evan Kulman, a broker for the real estate firm Compass, was not surprised when the Amagansett luxury home that he listed for sale on the first of August sold in a swift six weeks -- nearly four times as fast as similar homes were selling a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new owner snapped up the Long Island property -- a 4,043-square-foot, five-bedroom home with two acres -- for slightly more than $4 million, about 7 percent under the asking price, to use as a second home year-round, Mr. Kulman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why the quick turnaround? ''The architecture,'' he said. ''My buyer loved the wow factor this house exudes: walls of glass and lots of natural light.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Generally speaking, buying an upscale property to use as a getaway has traditionally been viewed as a lifestyle investment. Stocks and bonds cannot give you the same satisfaction as a heated saltwater pool with a waterfall, surrounded by mahogany decking, and Amagansett ocean breezes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While owning residential real estate is typically part of a diversified investment portfolio, what is different in the last year or two is the role the uncertain economy is playing in making purchasing decisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High-end residential buyers still want a good deal, as they always have, and, of course, a property that will eventually have capital appreciation, or will generate rental income, said Kathleen Peddicord, the founder of the Live and Invest Overseas publishing group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But once they have found what they want, there's more urgency,'' Ms. Peddicord said. ''In the past year, they've been quicker to pull the trigger on a purchase once they've identified such an opportunity.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many high-net-worth investors are plunking cash in a second or third high-end residence as a safety net, stemming from concern about a wide range of economic and political factors. These include the possibility of rising interest rates in the United States, China's slowdown, low oil prices, conflicts in the Middle East and the reality that equities have been lethargic and bonds have floundered in a bear market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People feel more comfortable investing in things they can see and touch and feel, that's the tangible nature of real estate,'' said Michael Sonnenfeldt, founder and chairman of Tiger 21, a network of over 440 members who collectively manage more than $40 billion worth of personal investable assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's why our members are pulling in on some of their private equity and fixed-income exposure, rolling up their shirt sleeves and getting involved in tangible assets that they buy with cash,'' Mr. Sonnenfeldt said. ''Fewer people, though, think of it as a pure investment vehicle. They want the security.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And they are not just buying United States properties in upscale urban real estate markets like New York and Miami, and vacation spots such as the Hamptons, Jackson Hole, Wyo., and Nantucket, in Massachusetts. ''I believe the interest among high-end property buyers in overseas markets is greater than ever right now,'' Ms. Peddicord said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People with money are keen to diversify it beyond the U.S. stock market in particular,'' she said. ''A vacation or second or third home in a sunny Shangri-La is an increasingly appealing option. It's a hard asset that doubles as a lifestyle enhancement and that cushions the buyer from any shocks U.S. markets may be in for.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While most ultra-high-net-worth individuals opt for a second or third home in the country where they reside, an increasing number of people with net assets of more than $30 million are buying homes in other countries, according to a 2015 report by Wealth-X and <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>. International homes account for 16 percent of nonprimary ultra-high-net-worth residences, compared with 11 percent in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The middle-market buyers are spending $250,000 to $500,000 on single properties, but high-net-worth individuals are spending $1 million or more in many markets, including the Caribbean and Europe, Ms. Peddicord said. ''We're seeing increased interest in Panama and countries where the U.S. dollar is strong,'' she said. These include France, Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Call it market timing. As investors look for a shelter for some money, luxury home prices have softened and are continuing to decline in many markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Pricing on the high end of second homes has experienced an elevated level of 'luxflation' over the past five years that is unprecedented in history,'' said Leonard Steinberg, president of Compass. ''This pricing is adjusting to more realistic levels as we speak, and people, quite smartly, are buying into the luxury market at a better price than they could have 12 months ago.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gap between asking prices and sales prices of luxury homes is widening, according to Luxury Defined 2016, a study of 2015's top sales in 100 luxury-housing markets worldwide by <span class="companylink">Christie's International Real Estate</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the study, ''The highest priced home sold in each market traded on average 19 percent less than their original asking prices, compared with 14 percent less in 2014.'' As a result of these economic and political factors, ''several luxury real estate markets across the globe saw a marked increase in sales from overseas investors and second-home buyers over the past 12-18 months.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond more realistic prices and the allure of a stable investment to weather stock market volatility, wealthy buyers are also purchasing eco-friendly homes that are energy efficient and smart homes with the latest tech installed to make it seamless to work from any location, according to the Wealth-X and <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, in the last five years, the trend has been toward gated communities, said David Forbes, private office head of <span class="companylink">Savills</span>, a global real estate firm.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Evan Kulman, a broker for the real estate firm Compass, was not surprised when the Amagansett[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/classifieds/realestate/locations/newyork/longisland/hamptons/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] luxury home that he listed for sale on the first of August sold in a swift six weeks — nearly four times as fast as similar homes were selling a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new owner snapped up the Long Island property[http://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/10-Canvasback-Ln_Amagansett_NY_11930_M35179-53041] — a 4,043-square-foot, five-bedroom home with two acres — for slightly more than $4 million, about 7 percent under the asking price, to use as a second home year-round, Mr. Kulman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why the quick turnaround? “The architecture,[http://www.hreo.com/html/inn_search.jsp?innum=38873]” he said. “My buyer loved the wow factor this house exudes: walls of glass and lots of natural light.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Generally speaking, buying an upscale property to use as a getaway has traditionally been viewed as a lifestyle investment. Stocks and bonds cannot give you the same satisfaction as a heated saltwater pool with a waterfall, surrounded by mahogany decking, and Amagansett ocean breezes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While owning residential real estate is typically part of a diversified investment portfolio, what is different in the last year or two is the role the uncertain economy is playing in making purchasing decisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High-end residential buyers still want a good deal, as they always have, and, of course, a property that will eventually have capital appreciation, or will generate rental income, said Kathleen Peddicord, the founder of the Live and Invest Overseas[http://www.liveandinvestoverseas.com/] publishing group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“But once they have found what they want, there’s more urgency,” Ms. Peddicord said. “In the past year, they’ve been quicker to pull the trigger on a purchase once they’ve identified such an opportunity.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many high-net-worth investors are plunking cash in a second or third high-end residence as a safety net, stemming from concern about a wide range of economic and political factors. These include the possibility of rising interest rates in the United States, China’s slowdown, low oil prices, conflicts in the Middle East and the reality that equities have been lethargic and bonds have floundered in a bear market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“People feel more comfortable investing in things they can see and touch and feel, that’s the tangible nature of real estate,” said Michael Sonnenfeldt, founder and chairman of Tiger 21[https://tiger21.com/], a network of over 440 members who collectively manage more than $40 billion worth of personal investable assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That’s why our members are pulling in on some of their private equity[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/p/private_equity/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and fixed-income exposure, rolling up their shirt sleeves and getting involved in tangible assets that they buy with cash,” Mr. Sonnenfeldt said. “Fewer people, though, think of it as a pure investment vehicle. They want the security.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And they are not just buying United States properties in upscale urban real estate markets like New York and Miami, and vacation spots such as the Hamptons[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/classifieds/realestate/locations/newyork/longisland/hamptons/index.html?inline=nyt-geo], Jackson Hole, Wyo., and Nantucket, in Massachusetts. “I believe the interest among high-end property buyers in overseas markets is greater than ever right now,” Ms. Peddicord said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“People with money are keen to diversify it beyond the U.S. stock market in particular,” she said. “A vacation or second or third home in a sunny Shangri-La is an increasingly appealing option. It’s a hard asset that doubles as a lifestyle enhancement and that cushions the buyer from any shocks U.S. markets may be in for.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While most ultra-high-net-worth individuals opt for a second or third home in the country where they reside, an increasing number of people with net assets of more than $30 million are buying homes in other countries, according to a 2015 report[http://www.sothebysrealty.com/resources/v_3_9_1_1004/siteresources/my%20folder/wealthx/sothebys_report_nov5_lowres.pdf] by Wealth-X and <span class="companylink">Sotheby’s International Realty</span>. International homes account for 16 percent of nonprimary ultra-high-net-worth residences, compared with 11 percent in 2010.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A WATERFRONT VILLA WITH A POOL</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">$2.3 MILLION</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This three-bedroom three-and-a-half-bath house sits on a two-acre waterfront lot on the eastern coast of the Caribbean island of Antigua. Behind the house is a large lawn dotted with trees, and past that, a small beach on Brown’s Bay shared with neighboring homes, reached by taking a few steps and a pathway down from the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house is named Sehil Villa, said Ken Meade, the owner, for a combination of his daughter’s and wife’s names: Selina and Hilda. Built of concrete blocks, with a white exterior, it is surrounded by tropical plants. The living room has a ceiling trussed with pine beams and glass doors with views over Brown’s Bay, Mr. Meade said; a dining area is to the right of the living room. The kitchen has Frigidaire appliances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two of the bedrooms are on the main floor and one is downstairs. Each has an en-suite bathroom, water views and access to the yard. There’s also a laundry room downstairs. The house, which has air-conditioning units in each bedroom and ceiling fans throughout, is being sold furnished.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bedrooms, living room and kitchen all open onto a large terrace running along the back of the house. Parts of it are covered, including an area that accommodates a small dining table, just outside the living room. A saltwater pool is at the center of the terrace, and a gazebo is on the far left.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The interior has 1,935 square feet. Including outdoor living spaces, the total is about 3,300 square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property neighbors a small hotel with a restaurant called Harmony Hall, which can be reached by a walk on the beach or a very short drive. Nearby shopping for staples like eggs and milk is in Freetown, a village that’s a three-minute drive from the property. The capital of St. John’s, a 40-minute drive, has more substantial shopping as well as restaurants. An uninhabited island is accessible by a boat ride of less than 10 minutes, and one of Antigua’s most celebrated beaches, Half Moon Bay, is a 10-minute drive, Mr. Meade said. The international airport is a 45-minute drive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARKET OVERVIEW</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real estate market of Antigua and Barbuda, a constitutional monarchy in the West Indies headed by Queen Elizabeth II and led by a prime minister and a parliament, is still recovering from the global housing crisis, real estate agents said. Prices are significantly lower than the peak, though buyer interest has recently increased. The country, encompassing both Barbuda and Antigua, has a population of around 90,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It is very much a buyer’s market,” said Richard Watson, the owner of the Antigua real estate agency Richard Watson &amp; Company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2008, prices for all homes fell by about 40 percent, said Brad Esty, the owner and broker of Stanley’s Estate Agents, which shares the listing with Seventh Heaven Properties. Today’s prices are about 20 percent lower than at the peak, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Luxury properties in Antigua tend to range from $1.5 million to $5 million, Mr. Esty said. It is common for properties on the international market to be priced in United States dollars, as this one is. The most expensive properties, in the Jumby Bay resort, top $20 million, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several recent changes — including the initiation of a citizenship by investment program — have increased demand, agents said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“With growing interest from North American buyers, increasing airlift and large inflows of investment into new developments, the market is improving,” Walter Zephirin, managing director of Seventh Heaven Properties, a luxury real estate company based in London that specializes in the Caribbean[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/great-homes-and-destinations/destinations/caribbean/index.html?inline=nyt-geo], wrote in an email.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Esty said prices, inquiries and the number of sales for all types of properties have risen since the same time last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Popular areas include Jolly Harbour, English Harbour, Jumby Bay, NonSuch Bay, Sugar Ridge, Tamarind Hills, and the residential area north of St. John’s, agents said. There are also several developments underway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHO BUYS IN ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Zephirin said that recently the proportion of buyers from the United States had risen, mirroring an increase in tourism from the United States and as a result of improved air connections. <span class="companylink">JetBlue</span> started flying to Antigua nonstop from New York in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a consequence of the weaker pound following the Brexit referendum, Mr. Zephirin said he expected the share of British buyers to keep declining.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Esty said his buyers come primarily from Europe[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/great-homes-and-destinations/destinations/europe/index.html?inline=nyt-geo], North America and Asia. Though foreign buyers have historically used their properties as seasonal homes, an increasing number are relocating to Antigua, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">English Harbour is popular with yachters, Mr. Watson said. He added that Antigua’s buyers tend to keep a lower profile than elsewhere in the Caribbean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Antigua attracts buyers who seek privacy, seclusion, and who wish to go around without being noticed,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BUYING BASICS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreigners who buy real estate in Antigua must obtain a noncitizens landholding license or be granted an Antiguan passport under the country’s Citizenship by Investment Program, said Septimus A. Rhudd, the founder of Rhudd &amp; Associates, a law firm in St. John’s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The license typically takes roughly three to six months to obtain, according to Nicolette M. Doherty, a lawyer with a practice in St. John’s. Stamp duty on the license is 5 percent of the government assessed value of the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other closing costs paid by the buyer include a stamp duty of 2.5 percent of the government assessed value, Mr. Rhudd said. There are also land registry filing and processing fees, which he estimated at around $80 in United States currency for a $1 million home. Purchases are typically handled by a lawyer, and the cost of that service is usually 1.5 percent of the purchase price. There is a 15 percent tax on that service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rhudd said buyers should request current, dated copies of the Land Register to verify ownership of the property and confirm that the title is unencumbered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Esty said buyers and sellers should do due diligence before selecting a real estate agent, because the industry is unregulated and a license is not required.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Sales of new single-family homes unexpectedly rose in September, pointing to sustained demand for housing even as data for the previous three months were revised with lower figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other reports suggested a stronger pickup in economic growth in the third quarter than is currently anticipated. The goods trade deficit narrowed sharply, while wholesale and retail inventories increased in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of the pieces of the puzzle have come back together in a positive direction, with a pickup in the export of goods to the rest of the world and new-home sales,'' said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said new-home sales increased 3.1 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 593,000 units last month, pulling them closer to a nine-year high reached in July. However, the pace for the previous three months was revised down by a total of 85,000 units from past estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales, which are derived from building permits, are volatile and subject to large revisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists had forecast single-family home sales, which account for about 9.8 percent of overall home sales, falling to a rate of 600,000 units last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The housing market may not be booming but it is clearly moving forward at a steady pace,'' said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pa. ''But the big problem is still the lack of inventory.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Consumer confidence retreated slightly this month after reaching a 20-month high in September, but home prices continued to climb at a solid pace in August as more prospective buyers competed for fewer properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer confidence slipped to 98.6 this month after rising to 103.5 in September, the <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span> reported on Tuesday. The September figure was the highest since confidence stood at 103.8 in January 2015. The September confidence number was revised down from an initial estimate of 104.1, the highest in nine years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The October figure reflected a drop in consumers' assessment of business conditions and employment prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with the small decline, consumer confidence was still at a level expected to support consumer spending and economic growth in coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The October decline reflected decreases in consumers' view about current conditions and their future expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of consumers saying business conditions at present were ''good'' decreased moderately, to 26.2 percent from 27.7 percent, while those saying business conditions were ''bad'' rose to 17.7 percent from 15.8 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their assessment of the labor market was also less positive, with those saying jobs were ''plentiful'' dropping to 24.3 percent, from 27.6 percent in September, although those who said jobs were ''hard to get'' also declined slightly, to 22.1 percent from 22.3 percent in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said the October decline put the <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span>'s take on confidence more in line with other confidence readings, including the <span class="companylink">University of Michigan</span> survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We read the October data as suggesting that household confidence has corrected after the outsized increase in the previous month,'' Blerina Uruci of <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> said in a research note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andrew Hunter, a United States economist at Capital Economics, said the October reading from the <span class="companylink">Conference Board</span> was still consistent with solid growth in consumer spending at an annual rate above 2.5 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, the Standard &amp; Poor's CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-city home price index rose 5.1 percent in August, after a 5 percent gain in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Portland, Seattle and Denver reported the strongest year-over-year increases for the seventh month in a row. Prices in Portland rose 11.7 percent. In Seattle, prices jumped 11.4 percent; in Denver, they rose 8.8 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steady hiring, low mortgage rates and some early signs of rising pay have encouraged more Americans to buy homes. Sales of used properties increased 3.2 percent in September from August, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> said last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Demand is high and enthusiasm for homeownership remains strong, especially among all-important young, minority and would-be first-time buyers,'' Svenja Gudell, chief economist at the real estate data provider Zillow, said. ''Still, the market can't stay on this course forever, and continued inventory shortages are leading to intense competition.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller index covers roughly half of American homes. The index measures prices compared with those in January 2000 and creates a three-month moving average. The August figures are the latest available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers are building more homes, but not quickly enough to restrain price increases. Builders broke ground on 783,000 single-family homes at a seasonally adjusted annual rate in September, up 5.4 percent from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices rose 8.1 percent in Dallas from a year ago, 7.1 percent in Miami, and 6.7 percent in San Francisco. All 20 cities recorded price increases from a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices plunged 35 percent from their peak in July 2006 until they bottomed out in March 2012. They have since risen to just 7.2 percent below the peak.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Is the Overall Market for New York Apartments Softening?</span>
</div><div class="author">By RONDA KAYSEN </div><div>463 words</div><div>16 October 2016</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. Last spring, we put our Upper West Side apartment on the market. It is a two-bedroom in mint condition with wraparound views, and we listed it for a little over $2 million. Ten days later, our agent suggested lowering the price because she said the market was suddenly soft. After about four weeks, we took the apartment off the market. I have noticed that many comparable apartments are now off the market, too. Is the overall market soft? Are two-bedrooms the problem? Is it my neighborhood?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market in New York is not what it was a year ago. Gone are the days when you could list your apartment for 20 percent more than the last comparable sale and watch the offers roll in over the next couple of days. ''This has been the story for 2016,'' said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the real estate appraisal firm Miller Samuel. ''The market has largely reset.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. While 2015 was a tale of sparse inventory sparking crazed bidding wars, 2016 has taken it down a notch. More apartments are on the market, and they take longer to sell. The market has softened, particularly at the top. So for those of you trying to unload a $65 million spread, now is the time to lower your expectations. The lower end of the Manhattan market, with apartments priced around $500,000, is still tight, as those homes are in high demand. Your $2 million two-bedroom falls somewhere in the upper middle of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers, sellers and brokers are slowly adjusting to this new reality, which might explain why your broker suggested changing course. It might also explain why other similar listings have languished.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now is the time to do your homework. Enlist three brokers to assess your apartment and suggest list prices. Find brokers that specialize in your neighborhood and price category. And never rely on the advice of any one person. ''I don't care if it's your husband's best friend, you should always have three pricing opinions from three area experts,'' said Kathy Braddock, a managing director at William Raveis in New York City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market may not be white-hot, but it is still active. It just might take you more time to sell, and you might not fetch as much as you hoped. But as Barak Dunayer, an associate broker at <span class="companylink">Halstead Property</span>'s West Side office, said: ''When property is priced correctly, it sells. Period.''</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">On Brooklyn's Waterfront</span>
</div><div class="author">By ROSS BARKAN </div><div>1024 words</div><div>18 September 2016</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDWhen Hurricane Sandy lashed the New York coastline and drowned neighborhoods like Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, there was some chatter about retreating from the waterfront.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But four years later, volatile weather and the ever-present threat of another storm surge has not deterred developers in this former fishing village, where a 28-story condominium is rising on a street once deluged by floodwater. A few blocks away, on a restaurant-lined avenue facing the waterfront, a seven-story commercial and residential development, with a rooftop deck and pool, is also under construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The projects are hallmarks of a building boom in Sheepshead Bay, an oft-overlooked neighborhood on Brooklyn's southern shore. Now home to many émigrés from the former Soviet Union, as well as growing Turkish and Chinese populations, the neighborhood offers numerous dining options and convenient beach access, at prices below those of Brooklyn's brownstone and hipster belt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You're seeing a really dramatic transformation,'' said Krishna Rao, an economist for the listing website StreetEasy.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices are edging up. The median asking price for apartments in the neighborhood rose to $320,000 for the year to date through Aug. 10 from $299,000 during the same period a year ago, according StreetEasy. Median asking rents rose to $1,797 a month from $1,600.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some local residents fear that the new construction will alter the neighborhood's architectural character and strain the infrastructure, snarling traffic and backing up sewer lines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People that live in this area are used to looking out and having views -- now everything is going to be blocked by this tower,'' said Theresa Scavo, the chairwoman of Brooklyn's Community Board 15, which includes Sheepshead Bay. ''Most people are afraid. They are afraid the character has changed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sheepshead Bay has recovered well from Hurricane Sandy, which smashed apart storefronts and aged bungalows on Emmons Avenue, the waterfront thoroughfare, in addition to flooding the neighborhood's second business corridor, Sheepshead Bay Road.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2013, a year after the storm, only 13 initial permits were filed for new buildings in Sheepshead Bay's 11235 ZIP code, according to the city's Department of Buildings. In 2014, the number rose to 18, and a year later to 21. In a sign of development to come, the Buildings Department approved 14 permits for demolition in 2013 and 42 permits in 2015.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 28-story, 321-foot condo tower at 1501 Voorhies Avenue, a joint venture by Muss Development and AvalonBay, will become the tallest structure in Sheepshead Bay when it is completed in 2017. While neighborhood zoning caps most residential buildings at around eight stories, the developers are able to build as-of-right after acquiring a plot of land that once was a parking lot and has no height restrictions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending approval from the attorney general's office, Muss and AvalonBay expect to market apartments next spring, with one-bedrooms starting at around $500,000. Amenities will include an 18,000-square-foot outdoor swimming pool, a dog run and bike storage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perched next to the Sheepshead Bay subway station for the B and Q lines, the building will provide future residents with easy access to Downtown Brooklyn and Midtown Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are all kinds of people this project could appeal to,'' said Jason Muss, a principal of Muss Development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sergey Rybak, the developer of the VUE, the seven-story, 58-unit building on Emmons Avenue with the rooftop pool, acquired the property for $13 million, buying out a diner that had operated on the site for 40 years. Mr. Rybak noted that the building, with its glass-sheathed retail base and spacious pedestrian plaza, is a ''drastic architectural departure from the stereotypical red brick and mortar and stucco-facade buildings that have plagued the area.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not everyone is a fan. A small group, the Committee to Save Sheepshead Bay, has urged Mr. Rybak to revamp plans because the building would be so unlike anything else in the area. Others worry that any new construction on the waterfront is a folly, considering how floodwaters rushed across Emmons Avenue during Hurricane Sandy. Both 1501 Voorhies Avenue and the VUE will lie in the most vulnerable of the city's six designated flood zones, the one closest to the shoreline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We should be pulling back from the waterfront, not doing density,'' said Steven Barrison, the president of the Bay Improvement Group, a coalition of Sheepshead Bay businesses and civic groups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rather than promote a gradual retreat from the waterfront, the de Blasio administration has focused on making the city's coastlines, and its structures, more resilient to storms, pointing to successes like Arverne by the Sea, a 117-acre development in Rockaway, Queens, that withstood Sandy with a heavy-duty drainage system, natural buffers and elevated land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sixteen new building codes have been added since Hurricane Sandy, including the mandatory elevation of crucial mechanical and electrical equipment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The neighborhood, like many others wedged against city coastlines, should see sea level rise by 11 to 21 inches by midcentury, said Ted Steinberg, a professor of history and law at Case Western Reserve University and the author of ''Gotham Unbound: The Ecological History of Greater New York'' (<span class="companylink">Simon &amp; Schuster</span>).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is this short-term, profit-driven real estate logic in conflict here with an extremely likely long-term trend toward environmental instability,'' he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: September 25, 2016, Sunday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about new developments in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, misstated a projected rise in sea level on the New York City coastline by midcentury. It is 11 to 21 inches, not 18 to 39 inches.</p>
<p>The seven-story VUE, on Emmons Avenue, is rising on a site where a diner once stood. There will be 58 luxury units, many of which will offer bay views. At the building's bottom is a glass-sheathed retail base and pedestrian plaza. (PHOTOGRAPHS FROM RYBAK DEVELOPMENT) </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dreaming of buying a home in the city? Using data from the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span>, HSH.com, which compiles mortgage and consumer loan information, crunched some numbers that reveal what it would take.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using the association's data for the second quarter for median home prices and HSH.com's average interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages for the same time period, the site calculated what you would need to earn annually to afford a home in 27 metropolitan areas around the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data showed that the national median sales price for homes is $240,700. And to be able to afford that, the average homeowner would have to earn $52,699.17 a year. But real estate, of course, is all about location, and the markets for homes are local.</p>
