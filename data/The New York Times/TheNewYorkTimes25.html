<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2003, Middlesex County residents had a median household income of $61,770, the highest in Connecticut, according to United States Census Bureau data released on Tuesday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Households in Tolland County had the second-highest median income, $61,290, while Fairfield County was third at $60,881.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Edward Deak, an economics professor at Fairfield University, said he was surprised that Fairfield County was not first. ''My take is that it's almost exclusively the fact of lower capital gains,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median household incomes for the other Connecticut counties in 2003 were Litchfield, $57,691; Hartford, $51,622; New London, $51,457; New Haven, $50,723; and Windham, $45,929.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The state's median household income, $56,409, was the highest in the country in 2003. New Jersey's was next, at $56,356. The national median was $43,318.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Deak attributed the state's first-place finish for 2003 to an improving stock market, but pointed out that in 2000, when the market was stronger, the state's median household income was much higher, and first in the nation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Deak also warned of the downside of a high median household income. ''The high income reflects high wages, which is good for the people who are working,'' he said. ''But it also makes it difficult for firms to locate and expand here because it is expensive to do business.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN the United States, there is talk about real estate bubbles. In Japan, there is knowledge, and plenty of it, about what happens after one pops.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Figures on housing starts released this week in Tokyo provided evidence that the market finally has gotten over the long and painful decline, and that the Japanese are more willing to buy new homes after avoiding them as prices fell for many years. In the 12 months through October, construction began on 1.22 million homes, nearly 8 percent more than at the low point reached in early 2003.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, there were limited signs that the growth in the housing market in the United States was leveling off, if not starting to fall. Sales of existing homes came in lower than expected, although new-home sales continue to set records. The number of housing starts in October was a little below the level of a year earlier, and mortgage applications were down.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ingrained beliefs in consumers in the two countries could not be more different. In the United States, houses have been an excellent investment for years, with property values rising rapidly in many markets. The conventional wisdom was that anyone who waited to buy was foolish.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Japan, on the other hand, the greatest real estate boom ever seen had, by the late 1980's, led to calculations that the grounds of the Imperial Palace in Tokyo were worth more than the state of California.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That was followed by 15 years of falling prices,'' said Richard Jerram, an analyst for Macquarie Research who is based in Tokyo. In Central Tokyo, he said, apartment prices probably fell 70 percent to 80 percent from top to bottom. Even with rock-bottom interest rates, many thought it foolish to buy a home that was virtually certain to lose value.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even now, the prices would not seem cheap to many Americans. Mr. Jerram said a typical Tokyo apartment of 70 square meters, or about 750 square feet, now costs about 40 million yen, or around $330,000. That is affordable to many, given that fixed-rate mortgages are available at 2 percent interest rates.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But those who bought in the past came to regret the decision. ''You could have paid $1.5 million a few years ago,'' Mr. Jerram said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It appears that home prices hit bottom about two years ago, and since then housing starts have gradually revived.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, Japanese housing starts remain below the levels of 1996, when a planned change in tax law made it seem wise to invest in housing before the law changed. But in the crucial area of housing starts intended for purchase by residents, the number has climbed above 1996 levels.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among such housing units, there is also a trend toward what the Japanese call collective housing, the equivalent of condominiums in the United States. During the bubble, many who worked in Tokyo were willing to endure two-hour rail commutes by rail to find affordable housing. Now, with prices down, some of those people appear to be buying new apartments in the city.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Japan and the United States are half a world apart, geographically. In terms of long-term housing cycles, they may be even more distant.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chart: ''As U.S. Boom Slows, Is One Starting in Japan?''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In contrast with the United States, the annual rate of total housing starts in Japan has not recovered since the real estate bubble there burst in 1990 . . .  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">. . . but more nonrental housing is being built in Japan, and the number of units is likely to rise above 1996 levels this year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Graph shows the nonrental housing units built in Japan for houses and apartments.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes fell 2.7 percent last month and the inventory of houses and condominiums on the market rose to the highest monthly level in more than two years, an industry trade group reported yesterday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said home sales fell to an annual pace of 7.09 million units in October, down from 7.29 million in September, which was the second-highest level ever.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were 2.9 million single-family houses, condominiums and co-ops for sale in October, enough to keep the market supplied for 4.9 months, up from 4.6 months in September and the most since June 2003, when there was a 5-month supply.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News had expected sales to fall to an annual pace of 7.2 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The association estimated that sales would have fallen by an even-greater 3.2 percent in October, had it not been for a surge in activity in cities like Baton Rouge, La., and Jackson, Miss., where evacuees from New Orleans and Mississippi coastal areas have bought homes since Hurricane Katrina struck at the end of August. Sales in the South fell 1.8 percent over all, to an annual pace of 2.8 million units.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing-home sales reflect the closing of transactions that were entered into a month or more before.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, in an indication that demand for homes remains relatively strong, the median sales price -- half the homes sold for more and half for less -- rose to $218,000 last month from $213,000 in September and was 16.6 percent higher than a year earlier.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The evidence is consistent with a slowing housing market but one that is still very strong,'' said Patrick Newport, an economist at the research firm Global Insight.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even a moderate slowdown will have a noticeable impact on economic growth, Mr. Newport indicated, because the rise in home values and the boom in mortgages has helped fuel consumer spending. ''There is no way around it,'' he said. ''The housing market is going to be a drag on the economy next year.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest data reinforced other recent measures of the housing market, like home construction, new-home prices and mortgage applications. Economists and real estate industry officials link the slowing to a rise in interest rates and, in some hot markets, worries that prices have risen too fast in a run of speculation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report also appeared to confirm anecdotes from real estate agents and others that houses were taking longer to sell, which suggests a decline in sales and prices in coming months, analysts said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory increase in condominiums and co-ops -- a 5.5-month supply in October, up from 5.1 months in September -- has been particularly sharp in recent months. There was a 4.8-month supply of single-family houses, up from 4.5 months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a note to clients, Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics, wrote: ''There are now 14.4 percent more homes for sale than a year ago, while actual sales are up just 3.3 percent. With mortgage demand slipping a bit and supply rising, price gains cannot continue at their current pace.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales were weakest in the Northeast, where they dropped 7.4 percent, and strongest in the West, where they were down 1.2 percent. Sales in the Midwest fell 1.9 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors' association characterized the sales drop as a healthy cooling of a heated market. ''Housing activity has peaked and is coming down a bit,'' David Lereah, the group's chief economist, said in a statement, ''and we expect further cooling in the coming months.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average interest rate on 30-year mortgages was 6.28 percent last week, up from 5.77 percent at the start of the year, according to Freddie Mac, the mortgage reseller.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">YOU make an offer on a condo, sign a contract, put together a sizable down payment and look forward to closing. Maybe you even start picking out furniture. People do it every day in Manhattan, but in recent months at the Essex House, the Central Park South mainstay that is both hotel and condominium, a large dose of uncertainty has been injected into that seemingly straightforward transaction.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least three times in the last 12 months, buyers expecting to close on apartments at the Essex House have seen the units taken away from them by the building's sponsor, which took the unusual step of exercising a right of first refusal to pre-empt the transactions.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost all New York condos reserve a right of first refusal for the condominium board, which allows the board to stop a sale if it agrees to buy the apartment for the same amount. But it is rare for boards to do so, largely because few have the cash or the willingness to borrow the money.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the bylaws of the Essex House condominium are unusual because they establish two rights of first refusal: one for the building's board and the other for the condominium sponsor. And in the case of the Essex House, a succession of companies that have held the role of sponsor have been willing to spend large amounts of money to get their hands on certain apartments. The sponsor currently owns seven condo units in the building. But city records show that since a portion of the Essex House was converted to condos in the 1970's, the sponsor has bought and sold several other units.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Essex House was acquired for $431 million in September by a company controlled by the crown prince of Dubai, Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, and the new owner has shown it is willing to use the sponsor's right of first refusal to buy up units in the building.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A condo buying binge of sorts was begun earlier this year by the previous sponsor, Strategic Hotel Capital, which used the sponsor's right of first refusal to buy Unit 2001 for $1.4 million on Feb. 10, according to a deed filed with the city. Strategic Hotel did the same 15 days later with Unit 3007, paying $1.05 million, records show. In April, it moved to intervene in another sale, saying it planned to take over the contract for Units 901 and 962, which had been combined into a single two-bedroom apartment and had gone to contract in March for $2.365 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this time the buyer went to court, filing a lawsuit against the seller that seeks to block the transfer of the apartment to the sponsor. The buyer was Gerald R. Benjamin, a managing director of Casas, Benjamin &amp; White, a financial advisory firm that specializes in mergers and acquisitions. Lawyers for Mr. Benjamin, who is based in Atlanta and who had made a down payment on the apartment of $236,500, filed the lawsuit in State Supreme Court in Manhattan on June 22. The seller of the apartment, a company called DTF Trucking, got the suit moved to federal court in August.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Essex House was sold on Sept. 8, but the new owner intends to complete the purchase of the apartment that had been in contract to Mr. Benjamin, according to the sponsor's lawyer, Jeffrey J. Temple. ''When they looked at the apartment, they decided it would be a strategic acquisition,'' Mr. Temple said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bruce Blum, an executive vice president of the Oxford Lodging Advisory and Investment Group, the asset manager for the Dubai owners, said a settlement in the case was close, but he would not give details.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Blum said the spurt of condo buying by the previous sponsor was driven by an expectation that values in the building would rise. Last fall some units were selling for about $1,300 to $1,500 a square foot. Today, he said, they are selling for $2,300 to $2,500 a square foot.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you look over the long term, for the most part the sponsor does not buy the units,'' Mr. Blum said. ''Given this recent spike in value in the last 18 months, it turned out to be a very wise decision by the prior sponsor to execute its right of first refusal. It was a bet by the former sponsor that values would increase, and they did.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the Essex House is different from other condos because the sponsor owns the hotel portion of the building, pays about 70 percent of the common charges and controls the condo board. He said the current owners had waived their right of first refusal on about four sales since taking over. ''The right of first refusal is something that came with the acquisition of the property and time will tell whether or not that will be something they will be exercising,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Benjamin refused to discuss the apartment fight. ''The parties are all working on a mutual resolution to the matter,'' he said. Ryan A. Becker, a lawyer for DTF Trucking, said the company would not comment.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Benjamin's real estate broker, Monica Dalton, said that the liberal use of the right of first refusal at the Essex House undermines the faith of buyers and that brokers should warn their clients that they might not be able to close on an apartment there. After Strategic Hotel intervened in Mr. Benjamin's purchase, she wrote a letter to condo owners in the building warning that the practice could harm values in the building.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's terrible and it's stupid because they're just going to knock themselves right out of the market,'' Ms. Dalton said. ''Knowing this, would you take a client over there?'' Ms. Dalton said that her commission on the sale comes out of the purchase price, so she will get paid even if the sponsor buys, but that she is upset over what her client has gone through.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cecilia Serrano, a managing director of Warburg Realty Partnership, said that she has sold about 40 apartments in the Essex House and that three of them over the years were taken by the sponsor. The most recent was earlier this year, when she represented both the seller and the intended buyer of Unit 3007, one of the units that Strategic Hotel snapped up in February.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said the buyer, who was from Mexico, was very upset. The buyer, she said, had spent money traveling to New York to choose the apartment and had paid legal fees related to the expected sale. ''I felt very bad for the buyer,'' Ms. Serrano said, ''but there was absolutely nothing we could do.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">J. Gregory Saver was the lawyer for the seller of Unit 2001, the other apartment Strategic Hotel bought in February. He said he had seen a right of first refusal purchase in a condo only twice in his career -- both times in the Essex House. ''Most condominiums in New York City simply don't have the funds to buy these things,'' Mr. Saver said. But he said that at the Essex House, the sponsor, as a large corporation, has had no difficulty coming up with the purchase price. When he asked why the sponsor wanted Unit 2001, he said, ''They told me they planned to hold it for short-term rentals and they thought it was a good price.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buyer who was shut out of that sale was Wallace Turner, a broker with Sotheby's International Realty in Palm Beach, Fla. Mr. Turner, who wanted the apartment as a pied-a-terre, went to contract on the two-bedroom unit in late November 2004 and had expected to close in early January. He and his wife, Betsy, hired a decorator and spent a substantial amount of money buying furniture and antiques to decorate it. Then, on Christmas Eve, he got a call from his lawyer, telling him the deal was off because the sponsor had stepped in to take the apartment. Mr. Turner said he was ''devastated'' by the news.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Listen, if we're going to spend all kinds of money on designing the apartment and ordering things, we fully expected to get that apartment,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Turners were able to return many of the things they had bought for the apartment, and they canceled orders for others. They have since recovered from their disappointment and gotten back to their New York apartment hunt. Last Monday, they were back in the city, looking at another apartment in -- of all places -- the Essex House. The unit was not right for them, Mr. Turner said, but he is still drawn to the building, with its park views, and he said he would consider trying to buy there again. ''Would we go through all this again?'' he said. ''Yeah, we probably would, but obviously with opened eyes.''  </p>

</div><div class="author">By DANIEL GROSS  </div><div>776 words</div><div>20 November 2005</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2005 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THERE'S a growing consensus that the housing market is cooling off. This month, Toll Brothers, the luxury home builder, warned that sales of McMansions were falling, and its highflying stock fell to earth. Last Thursday, the Commerce Department reported that housing starts, a reliable gauge of present activity, fell 5.6 percent in October from year-ago levels, while building permits, a reliable gauge of future activity, fell 6.7 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These data points are potentially worrisome, and not only for the legions of real estate brokers and Sheetrock layers toiling in offices and job sites across the country. In recent years, economists from Alan Greenspan on down have been discussing the way rising home prices and the growth of home-equity borrowing have fueled consumer spending, the piston that drives the country's economic engine. But in recent years, housing, real estate and the related industries have become a huge factor in another crucial economic area: employment growth.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the brief and shallow recession of 2001, the resilient United States economy stubbornly failed to create payroll jobs at the rate of past recoveries. Economists and politicians blamed factors and trends like outsourcing, global trade, high benefit costs and productivity growth. But amid the gloom, the real estate sector shouldered the burden of job creation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asha Bangalore, an economist at Northern Trust in Chicago, tallied figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics for sectors like construction, building material and garden supply stores. She found that from November 2001 to October 2005, housing and real estate accounted for a whopping 36 percent of private-sector payroll job growth. ''In four years, 2.3 million private-sector jobs were created in the U.S., and 836,000 were related to the housing sector,'' she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given everything else happening in the corporate world, the housing sector was the ideal place to have an investment boom. Building, selling, decorating and renovating homes is labor intensive. And unlike much investment in the broader manufacturing sector, the money pouring into the housing industry creates demand for American labor. Yes, some housing materials come from overseas. But virtually all the labor associated with housing -- the roofers, the investment bankers who securitize mortgages into bonds, the clerks at Home Depot -- is based in the United States.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result of the boom, the economy is more concentrated on housing than ever before. ''Residential investment as a share of gross domestic product is at the highest level in 50 years,'' said Jan Hatzius, senior economist at Goldman, Sachs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Zandi, chief economist at Economy.com, notes that real-estate-related industries accounted for 9.7 percent of total domestic employment in the second quarter of 2005, up from 9.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2001. And in areas with the hottest markets, housing plays an even more important role. In California, 13.4 percent of jobs in the second quarter of 2005 were housing-related, versus 12.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2001. In Las Vegas, the figure rose to 14.6 percent from 12.9 percent; in Panama City, Fla., it rose to 15.4 percent from 11.7 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what should we expect, now that housing appears to be cooling off?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the frothy regional markets go flat or if prices simply stop rising at the rates of recent years, there will surely be wide-ranging economic effects on consumer spending and on jobs. ''Housing and the job markets are joined at the hip,'' Mr. Zandi said. ''And if housing cools, so too will hiring and the job market more broadly, particularly in the more juiced-up housing markets.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If housing prices are flat in 2006 and residential investment falls 5 percent, there could be a direct loss of a few hundred thousand jobs related to real estate, Mr. Hatzius said. And the indirect effects will certainly be larger, Mr. Zandi said: ''Housing is going to go from being a key contributor to the job engine to being a significant drag on job growth.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there's some good news. Ms. Bangalore notes that while housing's contribution to job growth has declined in recent months, ''other sectors are picking up the slack.''  </p>

</div><div class="author">By VIKAS BAJAJ  </div><div>606 words</div><div>18 November 2005</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2005 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home construction dropped to its slowest pace in five months and building permits had their biggest monthly drop in almost six years in October, the government reported yesterday, providing more evidence of a housing slowdown.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although not conclusive, a stream of reports in recent weeks has signaled that the long housing boom is coming off its peak and that slower growth or even a decline might lie ahead.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A monthly report from the Commerce Department yesterday showed that builders started homes at an annual pace of 2.01 million in October, down 5.6 percent from September and down 2.3 percent from October 2004.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local authorities issued 6.7 percent fewer building permits in the month, for an annual rate of 2.07 million, a decline of 1 percent from October 2004.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What we are now seeing finally is enough of the housing indicators suggesting that the cooling process has begun to be a believer,'' said David Seiders, chief economist of the National Association of Home Builders.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, the association reported that a monthly index measuring its members' confidence fell in November as builders reported a decline in potential buyers. The group cited mortgage rates, which have risen in the last two months but remain near historical lows, and a decline in consumer confidence.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this month, Toll Brothers, the nation's biggest maker of luxury homes, reduced its sales forecast for the coming months and year, noting that buyers have become more restrained after Hurricane Katrina.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage interest rates have been rising steadily for several months. Last week, the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage carried a 6.36 percent interest rate, up from 5.77 percent at the end of July. Applications for loans for purchases and for refinancing have fallen an average of 2.9 percent in the last four weeks, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer confidence, as measured by leading surveys, fell after Katrina in September and October, but the shopping behavior of Americans appears to provide mixed evidence of that. Retail sales, excluding automobiles and gasoline, have grown briskly in recent months. But real estate agents and others in the industry have reported that homes are staying on the market longer, and that prices are increasing more slowly or even falling in some of the nation's hottest markets.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reports on other forms of economic activity have looked positive in recent weeks, as they did yesterday. In one, the Federal Reserve said industrial production rose by 0.9 percent in October as more factories, oil refineries and other plants on the Gulf Coast resumed operations. Production fell by 1.5 percent in September because of shutdowns in the region.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The numbers were also bolstered by resumed production at Boeing, which had a machinists' strike in September. Construction and manufacturing were both up 1.4 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is further evidence that the economic expansion remains intact,'' Anthony Chan, a senior economist at J. P. Morgan Asset Management, said, noting that gulf recovery accounted for only part of the growth.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department reported yesterday that initial claims for unemployment benefits fell to their lowest level in seven months in the week ended Nov. 12 -- to 303,000 from 328,000 the week before. People displaced by the three hurricanes -- Katrina, Rita and Wilma -- added about 19,000 claims to the totals.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DARIEN -- A HUSBAND-AND-WIFE development team is invoking Connecticut's controversial affordable housing law to circumvent restrictions on multifamily housing in an exclusive neighborhood here. Their proposal for 20 units of senior housing on one acre in a section more acclimated toward Wall Street moguls and yachting enthusiasts has riled residents and resurrected calls for repeal of the statute.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple, Christopher and Margaret Stefanoni, plan to raze their contemporary home on the Noroton shore of Long Island Sound and build two larger structures designed to resemble a manor house and barn.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Situated on Nearwater Lane, the 20,000-square-foot manor would hold 14 one- and two-bedroom condominiums on three floors; the 9,400-square-foot, three-story barn would house six two-bedroom units. All units would be for buyers 62 and older. ''There's a need for this housing,'' Mrs. Stefanoni said. ''It's huge.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Six of the one-bedroom condominiums would be sold at below-market rates of $160,000 to $220,000, depending on the buyer's income. To be eligible, a buyer would have to earn 80 percent or less of the state's median income (currently $77,100).  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The proposed density level is unheard of in this affluent community of roughly 20,000. The average home in Darien sells for about $1.68 million, and the town's top three taxpayers are country clubs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even more unlikely is the site. Zoned for single-family housing, Nearwater Lane is the sole access road to the Noroton Neck peninsula, home of the Noroton Yacht Club and of power brokers like Richard C. Breeden, the former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and Daniel P. Tully, the former chairman of Merrill Lynch.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Stefanonis, however, are claiming exemption from local zoning restrictions under Connecticut's Affordable Housing Appeals Law. Under the law, any town in which less than 10 percent of the housing stock meets the state definition of affordable cannot rely on zoning restrictions to deny developments that set aside at least 30 percent of their units as affordable.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An affordable housing developer who is turned away may appeal in court, thereby placing the burden on the town to prove that the project's potential infringement upon the public interest outweighs the need for affordable housing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Every year, there are perhaps dozens of bills filed that would either repeal or seriously undermine the law,'' said Jeffrey Freiser, executive director of the nonprofit Connecticut Housing Coalition. But the Legislature has stood by the 1989 law, which, by overcoming ''exclusionary zoning,'' has created an estimated 3,200 units of affordable housing, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like most Fairfield County suburbs, Darien falls far short of the 10 percent threshold (at 1.8 percent), despite 42 affordable units at a 189-unit complex developed two years ago by AvalonBay Communities. That project's 30-acre site is next to the railroad tracks in the more-densely-developed Noroton Heights.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prime location of the Stefanoni project has focused attention on Darien's exclusivity, only adding to residents' resentment. At a Planning and Zoning Commission hearing on the proposal earlier this month, one attendee cursed at a television cameraman, suggesting he go cover some other event. As the Stefanonis presented their proposal, the audience of more than 300 people snickered until the chairman asked that the heckling stop. The hearing was continued until Nov. 29 to accommodate the large number of speakers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the Stefanonis see it, residents' objections are grounded in fear of what an affordable housing project will bring. ''There's a lot of closed-mindedness about who people like that are and what they'll do to property values,'' Mrs. Stefanoni said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The young parents of four (with a fifth on the way), the Stefanonis said the homogeneity of Darien produced a ''culture shock'' when they arrived seven years ago from Cambridge, Mass., a much more diverse municipality. Not developers by profession, the couple are circumspect about how they make a living, saying only that they specialize in identifying properties with title problems and removing encumbrances to make them salable as single-family homes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Nearwater Manor project came about because providing housing for seniors is ''the right thing to do,'' Mrs. Stefanoni said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 60 seniors are on a waiting list for openings at Darien's only low-income elderly housing complex, according to Jo Lorraine Tatum, executive director of the Town Housing Authority. Turnover at the 30-unit rental complex is slow, averaging about three openings a year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Judith Morrison, Darien's social services director, also senses the need. ''We get lots and lots of calls from people looking for housing for their parents or for themselves because they're downsizing,'' she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Stefanonis' expressions of altruism are laughable to opponents, who accuse the couple of using the affordable housing law to squeeze a more-profitable high-density project onto an inappropriate site.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An e-mail message circulated before the hearing cautioned critics to avoid making public objections to the affordable and senior aspects of the project, lest they buttress Mr. Stefanoni's public arguments about the town's insensitivity to those who are not wealthy ''and make him more of a martyr.'' Speakers at the hearing cited concerns about traffic, emergency access to the site and the scale of the project.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most upsetting for some is the possibility that it will set a precedent. If the Stefanonis' project is approved, other developers may quickly follow suit, said Joseph R. Warren, an elected member of the town's Representative Town Meeting, which has no role in deciding this application.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project ''would do more to destroy the residential character of Darien than anything I have seen in recent years,'' Mr. Warren told the audience. ''It is in Hartford where this has to be addressed.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neighbors of the Nearwater Lane site take the project more personally. The senior housing proposal is ''sort of an exclamation point'' to several years of back-and-forth litigation involving the Stefanonis and at least two neighbors over the couple's right to an easement granting access to the water and their extensive cutting of trees, said Bruce Hill, a lawyer for three abutting neighbors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Stefanonis' development plan calls for 16-foot pole lights against one neighbor's boundary line, Mr. Hill said. A parking lot is three feet from another neighbor's property line, while six compressors for the central air-conditioning system are just 10 feet from the line. ''It almost seems deliberately to have violated every zoning regulation,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the Stefanonis acknowledge that they have had legal battles with their neighbors, they insist that allegations of retaliation are no more legitimate than claims that the project will cause traffic congestion.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It would be a lot easier to just build a McMansion, sell and move to another town,'' Mr. Stefanoni said. ''But Darien has enough McMansions. Darien needs some humility.''  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IS the safest bet in New York real estate also the smallest one?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Years ago, studios and one-bedrooms were the dingy wares at the bottom of Manhattan's property bin. Brokers disdained the tiny commissions their cheap prices brought. Common wisdom dictated that small apartments were poor investments.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But recent market reports show that studios and one-bedroom apartments are increasing in price, while the values of larger apartments are not keeping pace.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Studios and one-bedrooms made up 55 percent of all sales from July to September -- the most recent quarter -- compared with a market share of 50 percent last spring. Their average values climbed 11 percent, while prices on larger apartments fell an average of 16 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Market data show that the average studio in Manhattan now costs $428,831, and the average one-bedroom is $687,744. In some neighborhoods, studios are more expensive, per square foot, than the average for all apartments. The most recent median price data was not available for different sizes of apartments.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've seen a huge increase in the studios, and it's because of the first-time buyer,'' said Vickey Barron, an agent with Prudential Douglas Elliman. ''A few years ago people would have waited. They would have passed on the studio and pounced on the one-bedroom. Now the one-beds are priced out of their range. They're coming out of the woodwork.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shift has surprised some brokers, who remember when small apartments languished on the market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When I first started in the business 10 years ago, most brokers wouldn't even handle one-bedrooms,'' said Denice Rich, a broker with the Corcoran Group, because there was too much supply, and movement was slow. ''I was the only one who would take the sale.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, this sector hasn't become magically inoculated against slow spells and price drops. But real estate brokers and analysts say small apartments are now more resilient. For one, construction in Manhattan is geared toward sprawling luxury and not modest affordability, limiting the number of new one-bedrooms and studios entering the market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because they are cheaper to buy and maintain, small apartments also make natural second homes or pieds-a-terre for commuters or suburbanites tiptoeing into the city, according to Jonathan J. Miller, president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel. And they are often easier to rent, and draw high rents relative to an owner's mortgage burden, making them more profitable investments for buyers looking for rental income.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buyers buoying this wedge of the market are largely students and young professionals planting a foot in Manhattan, rather than families of four squeezing into a too-small home, brokers say. On the low end of the scale, they are singles looking for the cheapest studio available.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the higher end, they are buyers who could have afforded a two-bedroom in 2000 but now must settle for a large one-bedroom.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Typical of the young buyers is Laura Cave, 24, who bought a 450-square-foot studio at 20th Street and Seventh Avenue after moving from California to study graduate-level humanities at New York University. As with many younger buyers in the studio market, Ms. Cave's parents financed the purchase, and she pays rent to them. The apartment is in all their names.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because Ms. Cave plans to stay in New York after she graduates, her family decided that buying a small place would be a smart investment. They wanted an apartment near Gramercy, Murray Hill or Chelsea that could be renovated to increase its value.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventory analyses show that about 140 studios a month are arriving on the market this year, about the same rate as last year. Many of those were beyond Ms. Cave's grasp, or below her standards. The cheaper ones -- around $300,000 to $350,000 -- were tiny and shabby, with slanted floors and bad lighting. Other buildings had income requirements or policies against parental buyers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We didn't really have a lot of options because our price range was really low,'' Ms. Cave said. ''We were like, anything that wasn't a hovel, we'd look at. It was definitely a shock coming from L.A.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eventually, they found the studio on 20th Street, a clean and bright space with a sunken living area, separate kitchen and enough room for a full-sized bed and bulging sofa.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Younger buyers like Ms. Cave are not active only in New York; they make up the fastest-growing segment of the real estate market in the country, according to census data from 2004, the most recent available. The number of homeowners younger than 25 more than doubled over the last decade, to 1.64 million from 807,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ignoring the loft-buying Olsen twins, almost all of these younger buyers have incomes and savings that qualify them for entry-level apartments at entry-level prices, said Avi Voda, a broker with Douglas Elliman.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the high end of the small apartment market are couples like David and Ann Rosenbach, who live in Tampa, Fla., but fly to New York 10 times a year to visit friends, family and the Carnegie Deli. The Rosenbachs had talked for years about buying a second home in the city before finally snapping up a large one-bedroom on Central Park South last winter.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Rosenbach, an event planner, and her husband, a radiologist, had always wanted a two-bedroom apartment. But as prices rose, it became more difficult to find anything below their $1 million price limit. So they started looking at one-bedrooms with an eye toward renovation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is something different about a sense of ownership,'' Dr. Rosenbach said. ''It's so different from being a visitor. It's a sense of being a part of the city that I didn't have before.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When they found a 1,100-square-foot one-bedroom at 128 Central Park South, they pounced. They bought the eighth-floor apartment and soon began construction to add another bedroom. They probably saved tens of thousands of dollars by building their own two-bedroom.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers have always paid a premium for space and rooms in Manhattan, where prices per square foot for the largest apartments are easily double or triple the cost per square foot of a modest one-bedroom. Market data from Brown Harris Stevens show that the average price gap between studios and one-bedroom co-ops is $229,685. The leap from one-bedrooms to two-bedrooms is $693,358.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But those price gaps and disparities are shrinking, market data shows.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three years ago, prices of classic six apartments were rocketing past smaller homes. Two- and three-bedroom apartments sold for an average of $816 a square foot, while studios and one-bedrooms sold for $524 a square foot -- a $292 difference.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A third-quarter report by Brown Harris Stevens shows that the disparity between these smaller and larger homes has shrunk to $241 a square foot.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some neighborhoods, studio values have actually outpaced one-bedrooms, according to an analysis by Miller Samuel. On a square-foot basis, studios are more expensive than one-bedrooms in Yorkville, Hell's Kitchen, the Financial District and Turtle Bay, the analysis found.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Near Lincoln Center, studios cost $133 more per square foot than one-bedrooms, according to the Miller Samuel data. Along Riverside Drive and West End Avenue, they are $264 more per square foot. On the Lower East Side, Riverside Drive and in Midtown West, studios cost more per square foot than the average apartment price, which includes prices for two-, three- and four-bedrooms. Only in Chelsea did one-bedrooms cost more per square foot than an average apartment.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, not everyone selling small homes is throwing confetti. Denise Rosner, a senior vice president at Bellmarc Realty, said she sees weakness in this sector. She says one-bedrooms are sitting longer on the market, and apartments priced at $725,000 are being discounted and sold for $655,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Lately, the buyers that are out there aren't really a lot to write home about,'' Ms. Rosner said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for studio owners like Pam Shiu, 32, a buyer for Ann Taylor, rapid price increases have opened the door for better neighborhoods and larger homes. Seven years after she bought a studio in the Cherokee Apartments building on York Avenue for $72,000, Ms. Shiu decided to cash in. Over the summer, she sold her studio for $290,000 and bought a $435,000 one-bedroom in Park Slope, Brooklyn.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I wanted to have a grown-up apartment, with cupboard space,'' Ms. Shiu said. ''It was definitely a maturing phase.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some buyers said they worried about investing in homes whose value may have peaked. Studio values rose 35 percent over the last year, and one-bedrooms climbed by 27 percent, according to Miller Samuel. But what if that growth slows or stops?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suzana Grego, 33, chewed over those questions last month before she bought a one-bedroom in the West 80's for $645,000. It was her first home purchase in New York City and she worried about buying at the market's peak.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was thinking: 'This is not the time to be doing this. Do I really need to be doing this?' '' said Ms. Grego, a communications director for a nonprofit group. ''The one thing that made me worry less, the one thing that calmed me down is that I think you have to buy a place for the quality of life. Am I going to be happy here? Yes. Did I get what I want? Yes. I think the value is there.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A picture caption last Sunday with an article about Westchester real estate misstated the price and the location of an eight-room co-op. The listed price is $949,000, not $900,000; the building is in Yonkers, not Bronxville.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Sun Nov 20 2005   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AT dinner parties, on train platforms and in the supermarket aisle, as Westchester indulges in its favorite topic -- real estate -- one word is being heard more often than any other.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's all this talk about bubble, bubble, bubble,'' said Joe Houlihan, an owner of Houlihan &amp; O'Malley in Bronxville. ''The word has become part of the vernacular.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But is there a bubble? If so, is it about to burst?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local real estate professionals maintain resolutely that what we are witnessing is merely a healthy market coming out of an extraordinary growth spurt.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An overinflated market, about to explode? That is the unlikeliest of possibilities, they insist. In fact, the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service revealed in an October report that house prices have again reached record heights.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet for sellers about to list their homes, the numbers in the October report argue against unrealistic optimism in pricing. ''There were signs that the breakneck local market of the past two years had begun to ease to a more sustainable pace,'' was the phrasing it used.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also found that the double-digit price gains of the last two years had outpaced the financial capacities of many buyers -- even those relying on equity accrued in their present homes for trading up.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In other words, sellers cannot command excessively high prices,'' said Sona Davidian, a broker and owner of C. S. Mc Clellan in Pelham. ''They have to be realistic and look carefully at what similar properties are actually selling for.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The best strategy, Ms. Davidian said, is to price a house correctly to begin with -- especially with bidding wars occurring less frequently these days.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another factor: In early winter during the holiday season, sales velocity slows. A house that goes on the market too late in the fall, or at too high a price, may languish, and properties that become stale cause some buyers to shy away.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sellers looking to avoid such pitfalls should act now and not expect the windfall profits of previous quarters, agents advise.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of the third quarter of this year, the median sales price of a single-family home hit $711,700 -- 4 percent higher than for the third quarter a year ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median for a condominium soared to $390,000 -- an all-time record, 12 percent higher than it was a year ago. And the median for cooperatives jumped 16 percent in a year, to $185,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when it came to the number of sales, the story was slightly different. The listing service reported that in the third quarter, the number of single-family houses sold was down by 5 percent, to 2,002, and the number of co-ops sold was down by 1 percent, to 620. Condo sales increased by 3 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, while dollar volume of sales for single-family homes edged downward more than 1 percent, the dollar volume of sales for condos and co-ops increased by 20 percent and 13 percent, respectively.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another significant variable in assessing market strength is inventory. For the third quarter of this year it rose, to the concern of some experts. They point out that the supply of for-sale units typically declines from the second to the third quarters, reflecting brisk sales in the spring and summer months. This year, though, the end-of-quarter inventory for all types of for-sale units (single-family houses, co-ops, condos and multifamily homes) was 6,005 -- 21 percent higher than a year ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Market analysts are carefully watching a 45 percent year-to-year increase in the supply of condos, to 688 units, from 473 last year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is too early to tell from one quarter's experience whether this was a statistical fluke or a consequence of more units coming online from new construction, true market retraction, or some other anomaly in that sector of the market,'' the listing service said in its report.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, third-quarter inventory numbers represent only a small portion of Westchester's total housing stock (more than 200,000 owner-occupied units). And considered from a historical perspective, they were far below the 10,000 units available in the 1980's and early 90's.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's still an excess of demand over supply,'' said P. Gil Mercurio, executive director of the listing service.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">George M. Stone, a co-owner of Julia B. Fee in Scarsdale, said: ''My advice is that we are in a very healthy market, and it's still a good time to buy and sell.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But sellers of 20th-century homes should realize they are competing in a market for the attention of buyers with 21st-century needs,'' added Mr. Stone, whose agency has offices along the Long Island Sound and recently acquired Burbank/Whittemore in Larchmont.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHEN developers opened new buildings for sale in New York a year ago, brokers jostled for appointments, buyers camped out before open houses and people made decisions to part with thousands of dollars in a matter of minutes. One sales agent famously sold five luxury condos from the back seat of her BMW in a day.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The frenzy has died down, but the buildings keep going up.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With close to 16,000 units being built in Manhattan alone this year and next, and another 23,700 planned, according to Yale Robbins, a real estate publishing company in New York, there is much to choose from, especially at the high end, where a disproportionate amount of building is going on.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plentiful options mean that buyers can now return to a sales office repeatedly to examine floor plans before writing a deposit check. Where some buildings might have sold three or four apartments in a day, now developers are happy to sell that many in a month. And some buyers even feel bold enough to offer less than the asking price, though few developers are biting.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I just feel like people are waiting to pull the trigger,'' said Ariana Meyerson, project manager at 225 Fifth Avenue, a 192-unit building with $1 million one-bedroom apartments. ''They are waiting to see where the market goes.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some brokers predict that sales will slow more as newer apartments, often with fancier amenities than the building down the street, come on the market. ''I do think that there is going to be product sitting on the market a year from now,'' said Michael Shvo, a broker who markets new developments.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Citywide, developers applied for building permits representing 15,870 new units in the first six months of this year, census figures show. Last year they applied for 25,208 units, the most since 1971. A large proportion of the newest units are being marketed as ''luxury'' apartments, a term that has come to mean anything from $600,000 studios in Brooklyn to $40 million penthouses on Central Park West.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bounty of choice includes the planned condominiums at the Plaza Hotel and in the Stanhope Hotel on Fifth Avenue near the Metropolitan Museum; chic new apartments designed by the French architect Jean Nouvel at 40 Mercer Street in SoHo; and the Philip Johnson-designed units at the Urban Glass House on Spring Street nearby.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We do have a healthy amount of developments coming on stream,'' said Kirk Henckels, director of Stribling Private Brokerage in Manhattan. ''And if there is one question mark'' looming about the state of the market, he said, ''that may be it.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although condo prices are still increasing, brokers said buyers are being shrewder about what they are willing to pay. Six months ago the luxury market was so heated that ''you could basically put a 3,000-square-foot coal chute on the market and three people would try to buy it,'' said Frederick W. Peters, president of Warburg Realty. Now, he said, buyers were being more selective about location and quality.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stacey Silverman, 41, has been looking for a two-bedroom apartment in a new development for the past six months. She has yet to put down a deposit. ''I think there is a lot to choose from, and there is more coming on the market,'' she said. ''So I'm taking my time.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some developers have not caught on to this new reality. ''Sellers are in denial that the market has shifted,'' said Jonathan Miller, a New York appraiser. ''On projects that appear to have stalled, the developer kept ratcheting up the prices systematically -- which was the norm for the past few years -- until it was priced out of the market.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some new developments are still selling briskly, even at the superluxury end of the market. The developers of the condominiums at 15 Central Park West have had no trouble selling 74 units worth $650 million in the two months since the sales office opened.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">William Zeckendorf, a partner in the development, said 12 of 16 penthouses, including one at $45 million, were under contract. A prominent Wall Street investor lost out on a duplex penthouse when he tried to buy at a discount and another buyer offered full price, Mr. Zeckendorf added.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But brokers said the scramble at 15 Central Park West, designed by Robert A. M. Stern in the spirit of such grand buildings as the San Remo and the Dakota, was largely a reflection of its irresistible location, lavish amenities and old-world charm.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alex and Luba Rabey were not even looking to move from their apartment at the Grand Millennium on Broadway when they heard about 15 Central Park West. Mr. Rabey, a 65-year-old consultant, said they were attracted to the building's particular vantage on the park, its gym facilities and its 11-foot ceilings. They have signed a contract to buy a $4.87 million three-bedroom apartment.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Name architects have not necessarily spurred sales at either the Richard Meier tower at 165 Charles Street or Charles Gwathmey's undulating glass building at Astor Place. They are both in downtown locations that some brokers said wealthy buyers do not prefer.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tower at 165 Charles Street, the third to be designed by Mr. Meier overlooking the West Side Highway, has been on the market for over 18 months. Out of 31 units, 24 have sold, including a $20 million penthouse. One broker who asked not to be named because she did not want to criticize a building where she might bring clients said it should have sold out by now. Izak Senbahar, the developer, said, ''It's a very specialty product that sells at its own speed.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite extensive media coverage and a model apartment sponsored by Esquire magazine, the Related Companies, developer of the Gwathmey building, has sold only 24 of 39 units there. David J. Wine, vice chairman of Related, said he was perfectly happy with those numbers, given what buyers were paying: $1,400 to $2,600 a square foot.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, he acknowledged, ''buyers, at those numbers, because they have more choices, are being more cautious about where they buy.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even at less lofty levels, buyers are hesitating. ''It's taking longer to sell out buildings,'' said Richard Cantor, a principal at Cantor &amp; Pecorella, a marketing firm that is handling 1,500 units in 10 new buildings around Manhattan.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has taken 10 months to sell 43 of the 79 units at Beacon Tower, a high-rise condominium in the Dumbo neighborhood of Brooklyn, despite the lure of a Zen garden, a gym and high-end kitchens. Steve Rutter, who handles marketing of new developments for Corcoran Group in Brooklyn, said the developer, Leviev Boymelgreen, closed down the sales office for part of the summer because sales were sluggish, and reopened after Labor Day. Only four apartments have sold since then.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, nobody is predicting a glut or that prices will collapse. That is partly because today's building boom pales in comparison to the one that took place in the 1980's (developers built 125,623 units in Manhattan from 1985 to 1991, Mr. Miller, the appraiser, said). That building spree exacerbated the effects of the stock market crash and a severe recession, and median prices fell as much as 45 percent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 1999 builders have put up only 13,374 units, about a tenth of what was built in the 1980's.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time around, Mr. Miller pointed out, developers have focused on the upper third of the market, making it vulnerable to the impulses of one group of buyers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the moment, many remain in the game. Ali Akansu, a professor at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, recently bought an $815,000 one-bedroom apartment in Bryant Park Tower, a 94-unit condominium that will sit atop a hotel. He said he figured that it would be a good investment, and that maybe his college-age daughter would move in at some point. But when he was looking, he said, he saw several other projects that he deemed overpriced.   </p>

</div><div class="author">By VIKAS BAJAJ and DAVID LEONHARDT; Motoko Rich contributed reporting for this article.  </div><div>1332 words</div><div>9 November 2005</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2005 The New York Times Company.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nation's largest maker of luxury homes, Toll Brothers, said yesterday that soaring home prices appeared to have ended. It was the latest sign that many real estate markets are slowing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the company said it expected to report a record profit for the last 12 months, it predicted that it would sell fewer homes over the next year than it had forecast and would make less money than previously anticipated. High gas prices and the recent hurricanes seem to have rattled consumers, causing some to delay purchases of houses, company executives said. Also, some local governments appear to be holding back on construction permits, to slow new building.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of Toll Brothers fell after yesterday's announcement and ended the day down 14 percent, at $33.91. The news dragged the shares of other home builders lower, and the Bloomberg United States home builders index fell 7 percent yesterday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The price increases pre-Katrina were at warp speed, and since Katrina, instead of going up $5,000 or $10,000 every week or two, we have been limited to no price increases or very limited price increases,'' Robert I. Toll, the company's chief executive, said in a conference call yesterday. The number of investors buying condominiums and houses in the hope of turning a quick profit also seems to have plunged, he said in an interview last week. ''The true speculator is gone from the market,'' Mr. Toll said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Certain markets appear to be losing steam faster than others, Mr. Toll said. Washington, Chicago and Northern California were slowing from high levels of activity, while Boston, Denver and the west coast of Florida were still hot markets for the company. Las Vegas, which has experienced a huge condo building boom, slowed down ''ever so slightly'' in July and appears to be staying at that level, he added.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company, whose homes sell at an average price of $679,000 and whose typical buyer has an annual family income of more than $100,000, emphasized that it still expected a happy ending for the long housing boom.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices, the company said, are expected to continue rising, but at historical averages and not at the rapid rates that they have recently in the Northeast and California. Since 1964, new-home prices have risen an average of 6 percent a year, according to the Commerce Department. Last year, they rose 13 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with its reduced forecast, Toll Brothers expects to sell 7 percent more homes in its current fiscal year, which began Nov. 1, than it did in the previous year. Last year, the company's revenue rose 50 percent, to $5.8 billion, according to preliminary figures released yesterday. The company will disclose detailed financial results and projections for 2006 on Dec. 8.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many of the nation's hottest real estate markets, houses are taking much longer to sell than they once did, and some agents are talking about a slowdown in attendance at open houses. In September, there was a 4.7-month supply of already- built homes on the market, up from 4.2 months a year ago, according to the National Association of Realtors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Toll said last week that in some markets, the company was starting to offer incentives like a luxury kitchen at no extra cost to the buyer.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">J. Patrick Lashinsky, a senior vice president at ZipRealty, a brokerage firm with offices in 15 metropolitan areas, said, ''In a lot of our markets, we're seeing inventory levels up 20, 30, 40 percent from a few months ago.'' Some of the biggest increases were in the Phoenix, San Diego and San Francisco areas, he said, and the number of houses for sale had also risen in Atlanta, Boston and Chicago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the moment, at least, prices have stopped their steep climb, with some owners reducing asking prices to attract buyers. Average sale prices traditionally drop in autumn, because home purchases slow then, but the decline appears to have been steeper than usual this year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between August and September, the median sales price of already-built homes dropped 3.6 percent nationwide, to $212,000. During the same period last year, prices fell 1.6 percent, according to the National Association of Realtors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price for new homes fell 5.7 percent, to $215,700, from August to September, according to the Commerce Department. That compares with a 3 percent drop a year ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard A. Smith, chairman and chief executive of Cendant's real estate business, said he, too, expected a slowing in the housing market next year, but that 2006 would still be one of the strongest years on record for home sales. ''The problem with forecasting this time of the year is, if you look at the seasonality of the business, this is always the slowest time of the year,'' Mr. Smith said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slowdown appears to be linked to a steady rise in mortgage rates in recent months. The average rate on 30-year fixed mortgages was 6.31 percent last week, up from 6.15 percent the week before and 5.77 at the start of the year, according to Freddie Mac. Even with the increases, the rates are still below historical averages.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Loan applications for purchases and refinancing fell 4.8 percent in the last week of October and were 15.2 percent lower than the same week last year, the Mortgage Bankers Association said. Loans for purchases fell 6.2 percent for the week and 11.9 percent from a year ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists argue that the recent softening might be the beginning of a more severe downturn. Neither income nor population has grown quickly enough to justify the doubling of prices in some areas since 2000, these economists say. They add that rents have risen much less than home prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is a large psychological element behind current housing prices,'' said Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic Policy Research in Washington. ''People are willing to pay them because there is an expectation that prices will continue to rise. Once people don't have that expectation, things will change.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even many analysts who are not so pessimistic say the recent increases cannot continue.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Home prices have been growing so fast for so long, outstripping income growth for many years,'' said Gene Huang, the chief economist of FedEx, who keeps an eye on home prices as an overall gauge of the economy's health. ''Some kind of adjustment has to happen.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Per capita disposable income grew 3.6 percent over the last year, according to the Commerce Department.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than four out of five economic forecasters surveyed by Blue Chip Economic Indicators said they expected existing-home price growth to slow to 5 percent by the end of 2006, from 13 percent over the last 12 months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All of a sudden, the ads in the paper show special mortgage deals, special incentives,'' Mr. Toll said last week, referring to new housing developments nationally. ''That's an absolute indicator that the market has softened.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Toll also attributed his company's new sales forecast to toughening local regulations, saying governments in many cities were delaying new projects to placate existing residents who want slower growth.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are building in pretty well-established territory which means it's also pretty well regulated,'' he said on the conference call. ''We have a heavier-hitting average population, and their desire is 'Not in my backyard, please slow it down.' ''  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IT has been the unbroken code of Long Island living, at least since Levittown and American suburbia were born in the 1940's: Buy a home, hold on to it and watch its value climb.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With only an occasional pause, the axiom has held true through recession, inflation and expansion, and the red-hot property market of recent years has done little to tarnish it. On paper, at least, homeowners have been rewarded as property values have soared to unprecedented heights.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this paper prosperity comes at a cost, one that is growing so fast that it is starting to erode the benefits for anyone who is not ready to cash in now and relocate to some less-expensive region.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the last decade, home prices have outpaced incomes by such a wide margin that many of Long Island's festering problems -- worsening shortages of rental housing and of lower-priced homes, taxes that are high and still rising, the sometimes prohibitive costs of doing business and providing social services, and the flight of young families -- have become harder to ignore.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barring a sudden downward spiral in home prices -- which few experts foresee and which would create another set of headaches -- Long Island's leaders have little choice but to confront the politically thorny problems surrounding high prices, which are sapping the region's economic vitality.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Otherwise, Long Island is likely to go on losing businesses and young residents to other regions at an accelerating clip, economists say. Nassau and Suffolk, whose populations are already aging faster than the nation as a whole, will grow even grayer, putting more strain on the region's finances and inhibiting its growth.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''New businesses and young college graduates are discouraged from locating here,'' Thomas R. Suozzi, the Nassau County Executive, said earlier this year. ''And the seniors who moved here when suburbia first began 50 or 60 years ago are now house-rich but income-poor, and are especially hurting.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A litany of troubling figures supports Mr. Suozzi's claims. Since 1998, housing prices on Long Island have nearly doubled as a percentage of family income, making it difficult not just for low-income families, but also for people with middle-class jobs, to buy a home. The median sale price hit $470,000 this year in Nassau and $385,000 in Suffolk.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The usual way to ease such a strain is for local lawmakers to allow more land to be developed. But Long Island is rapidly running out of available property for new homes; by one count, there are just 67,000 acres of suitable land left.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With land scarce, the only way to increase the housing supply is to allow more living units on each acre. But plans for high-density housing are usually bitterly resisted by suburbanites because of the association with urban problems like poverty and crime.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are lingering fears in the suburbs that we're inviting the city in'' if we build high-density housing, said Pearl M. Kamer, the chief economist at the Long Island Association, the Island's largest business organization. ''Most people came from the city, but they like to shut the door when they get here.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The same goes for rental housing in general, which has been strongly discouraged for years by zoning laws in many Island communities. Long Island has only half as much residential rental space, as a percentage of housing, as the national average; just 19 percent of all housing units on the Island are rentals, and the rents they command are much higher than they would be if the supply matched the national average.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anyone who already has a home and is not currently looking to move may be tempted to shrug off high prices and short supply as of no immediate concern to them. But the hot housing market is taking a growing toll even on those who are not in the market and have no plans to move.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most significant way is through property taxes. Local governments rely heavily on them, and the taxes Island homeowners pay are among the highest in the country; they have continued to rise along with home prices, which have grown at double-digit rates in each of the past five years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taxes are rising in great measure because the cost of doing anything on Long Island, from repaving a street to hiring a middle-school principal, has been driven up by the high cost of housing and the higher wages that employers, including governments, must pay to attract and keep workers. High house prices also make it much more expensive for municipalities to acquire land they need for public purposes like parks or widened streets, which also feeds back into higher taxes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People on fixed incomes, like retirees, and working people whose paychecks have not kept pace with their tax bills are being squeezed hard by the rising burden, despite their paper gains in net worth from the appreciation of their houses. ''You can't pay your taxes with the equity in your house,'' said Steve Levy, the Suffolk County executive. ''It helps you only if you sell it and move.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher house prices mean that businesses and governments, schools and hospitals all have a hard time recruiting promising new employees from other regions of the country to live on Long Island. And the employers who do manage to bring young recruits to the Island often find that they lose them again in a few years, when they prepare to start a family, because suitable homes on the Island are out of their reach.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, many native Long Islanders who are starting careers find that the only way to afford a place to live other than mom and dad's spare room is to leave the region.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the Long Island Association, between 2000 and 2003, Nassau and Suffolk suffered a net loss of 26,000 residents between the ages of 25 and 34, a loss five times the national average in proportion to the total population. Among people 35 to 44, the net loss was 13,000 people over the same period.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some older people are also going because their children are. ''If your children can no longer live here, why not move where your kids are?'' said Nancy Douzinas, president of the Rauch Foundation, which compiles an annual statistical study of Long Island life. ''People are leaving in tandem.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Northrop Grumman, the military and aerospace company, is trying to fight the trend. The company, no longer the Island's largest employer but still an important presence with 2,000 workers in Bethpage, says it has little trouble attracting entry-level engineers with starting salaries of about $55,000 a year. A survey found that nearly one-quarter of its work force, including many of the new employees, lived with parents.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But retaining them is another matter. ''Local schools are turning out good people right out of college, but the problem is keeping them,'' said Tom Sullivan, a senior real estate project manager at Northrop Grumman. ''When the folks who were living with their moms and dads started looking for their homes, that's when the sticker shock hit them.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The attrition is a financial blow to Northrop Grumman, which spends about $250,000 in salary, benefits, training and other support costs on each engineer over the first three years on the job.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To slow the brain drain, Northrop Grumman started working with two nonprofit groups, the Long Island Housing Partnership and the Community Development Corporation of Long Island, to make it easier for employees to qualify for help putting together a down payment on a new house.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The program has slowed the departures. But Northrop Grumman says it is difficult to attract experienced employees from other parts of the country because of high home prices and taxes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Workers at Northrop Grumman are not alone. George Ciresi III, an East Patchogue native, returned to the Island in 2003 after spending seven years in college and graduate school in Connecticut. As a physical therapist, he earned $60,000, which he thought would be enough to cover a mortgage. But he couldn't find anything affordable within reasonable commuting distance of his clinic in Great Neck.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When I was in school, I thought I could afford a house, but the reality of how much it costs has set in,'' said Mr. Ciresi, now 26.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like a growing number of young professionals on Long Island, Mr. Ciresi moved back in with his parents instead, so he could pay off his student loans and save money for a down payment.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two years later, his annual income was up to nearly $90,000, including bonuses. But that made him ineligible for many public subsidies and low-cost mortgages intended to help first-time home buyers. Eventually, he found the Community Development Corporation, which helped him with the mortgage on the $270,000 condominium he recently bought in Medford.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, ''I'm just barely able to afford the apartment,'' Mr. Ciresi said. ''I'm very family-oriented and I don't want to leave Long Island. But if it came to living at home for another five years, I might leave.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other suburban counties across the country, including those near San Francisco, Washington and Atlanta, suffer from many of the same ills that plague Nassau and Suffolk.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Long Island's problems are more pronounced than most, because developable land is more scarce and the geography of the Island more constricting: There is hardly a practical way to commute to the Island from some other suburban or rural area, or even most of New York City.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Island's infrastructure -- its highways, schools, hospitals and water mains -- is also older on average than that of most other suburbs, and more expensive to maintain for that reason as well. And the Island's complex web of local governments and taxing jurisdictions has not made it any easier. Nassau County alone has 3 townships and 2 cities, 64 villages, 58 school districts, 71 fire districts, 24 garbage districts and 36 water districts, among scores of others.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These overlapping layers of local government developed in large part because Long Islanders wanted to exercise local control over the places where they live. But experts point to the inherent duplication and inefficiency of the system, which many call an expensive anachronism.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anachronistic is also what many advocates call the Island's zoning and land-use laws, which have been shaped by the political imperative to protect homeowners' property values and have arguably worked too well. Now, many housing advocates say, they stand in the way of creative approaches to the housing problem, like higher-density housing and mixed-use developments.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House prices are now so high that residential development tends to crowd out all other land uses on the Island. Brownfield sites that once held job-creating businesses and institutions, like the old Thypin Steel works in Port Washington or the state psychiatric hospitals in Kings Park and Brentwood, are proposed for redevelopment as housing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sites like these often need significant environmental cleanup before homes can be built. To pay for that, developers demand permission to build at high densities, or government agencies demand that subsidized housing for low-income people be included in the project -- either of which is likely to provoke major opposition in the community.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet without housing that first-time buyers and lower-income people can afford, either on their own or with subsidies, Long Island risks driving away the workers who are needed to keep the local economy running, and the families who are needed to refresh and sustain community life.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People are starting to realize that there has to be a sea change in attitudes,'' said Jim Morgo, the Suffolk County commissioner of economic development and work-force housing. ''If there isn't affordable housing for our young people, it's a prescription for economic disaster.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE building of houses, which buoyed the American economy during the 2001 recession and then spurred the recovery, is no longer leading the economy up.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Figures released this week by the Commerce Department showed that private construction spending set a record in September, but the third-quarter average was only 6.5 percent above the figure in the quarter a year ago, before adjusting for inflation. That matched the growth of the overall economy. By contrast, in 2004 residential construction spending was growing twice as fast as the overall economy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While home builders were raking in the money, other areas of construction were not nearly as strong. The most drastic change was in office construction, which set a record in December 2000, when spending hit a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $58 billion. By early 2003, the rate had fallen more than half, and most of that lost ground has not been made up.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A result has been a fundamental shift in the proportion of private construction spending going to building homes and apartments. The proportion fluctuated around 60 percent of total spending for years, but now it is around 70 percent. That makes the economy potentially more vulnerable than it usually is if housing construction were to decline sharply.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By contrast, office buildings now account for a little more than 4 percent of the private construction budget, half what they accounted for in 2000. Commercial building, of stores and malls, has not suffered as much, but it has lost a quarter of its market share.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A person looking for signs of an American industrial revival -- or at least an end to decay -- could take heart from the figures for manufacturing construction. Its share of the total construction pie, above 9 percent a decade ago, fell to 3 percent but has now stabilized and even begun to edge up. In dollars, September spending was at an annual rate of $27.6 billion, up almost 40 percent from the low reached in February 2003.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An area with little sign of a turnaround is utility construction. Spending on communications sites has stabilized, but power plant spending in September reflected an annual rate of $22.6 billion, the slowest pace since early 2001. Over all, the utility share of private construction spending is down to 4.2 percent, the lowest since the government began collecting such figures in 1993.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There has been widespread talk of a cooling in the housing market, and mortgage applications have slowed in recent weeks -- possibly an indicator of slower sales to come. But while spending on residential construction is no longer rising at 20 percent or more a year, as it was a year ago, it is still rising. Builders, it appears, are not worried.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chart: ''Fading Boom''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private construction spending was a source of strength for the United States economy for much of the last decade. A year ago, it was growing twice as fast as the overall economy, but over the last four quarters it has grown at a slightly slower rate. Spending on new homes and apartments was the big factor in the boom, but the residential share of construction spending is down a little from the peak reached earlier this year.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eleven months after taking office in 2002, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg unveiled the most ambitious housing initiative undertaken by any mayor since Edward I. Koch -- a $3 billion, five-year plan to begin to tackle New York City's housing shortage by producing 65,000 apartments and homes for New Yorkers with low and moderate incomes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several years into the plan and facing an election next week, the Bloomberg administration says it has financed nearly 29,000 of the promised units; it has started construction on more than 12,000 and work on preserving some 16,000 units. It has rezoned large swaths of the city to make room for new apartments. Its Housing Development Corporation is now the nation's biggest issuer of bonds to finance lower-cost housing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the administration says it financed an additional 18,550 units before its plan went into effect.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing has become one of the hottest issues in the mayoral campaign. Mayor Bloomberg's Democratic opponent, Fernando Ferrer, has accused the administration of not doing enough to solve what is increasingly called the crisis of affordability in the city. And while some find fault with specific elements of the mayor's housing policy, many housing experts say the administration has done more than any administration in decades to address the shortage of homes for low- and moderate-income people.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The administration's record has been praised by community organizations, developers of low- and moderate-income housing and the city's extensive network of housing advocates, many of whom say they have found the Bloomberg administration more interested in housing, more open to new ideas and more willing to compromise.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The mayor's first five-year plan put housing back on the screen in public policy,'' said Victor Bach, senior housing policy analyst at the Community Service Society of New York. ''There has been a long history of Washington looking the other way on housing issues. To find local government stepping into the breach is very heartening. That's what the mayor did. He put some fire into a major development initiative.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of what the administration has accomplished has been done under less than optimal conditions. Federal financing for low- and moderate-income housing has dwindled. The supply of city-owned buildings taken in foreclosures has almost run out, cutting off a major source of what was once low-cost land. With the real estate market booming, developers have options they have not had for years: They can build market-rate housing almost anywhere in the city.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, one part of the administration's strategy has been to rezone areas of the city to create more developable land, then to use so-called inclusionary zoning provisions to encourage developers to include lower-priced units. Other administration initiatives have included the creation of what is said to be a $200 million acquisition fund, supported by five major foundations, for low-interest loans to developers of lower-cost housing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, the administration has agreed to use $130 million in Battery Park City Authority revenues to help subsidize low-income housing. It is enlisting developers to build affordable housing on vacant land, including parking lots, on New York City Housing Authority property. It wants to overhaul the city's building code in order to streamline regulation, allow new technologies to be used, and bring down construction costs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's been a tremendous record,'' said William R. Frey, senior vice president for the Enterprise Foundation, a national foundation that works with investors, including banks, to encourage the development of housing for low-income people. In response to Mr. Bloomberg's 2002 initiative, Mr. Frey said, the foundation decided to invest a billion dollars in grants, loans and equity in New York City.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In light of the challenges of affordability which face the city, they could have just allowed the market to pick up and pay significant amounts of money for city-owned property for development of market-rate projects,'' Mr. Frey said. ''But instead they have a program which allows for private development to happen but also created programs and resources targeted for affordable low-income housing development.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even the administration's admirers want more done. Some want its housing programs more focused on the city's poorest residents. Some want inclusionary zoning to be official policy citywide. Some want greater priority given to housing the homeless, a more aggressive approach to policing housing-code violations, and more attention to what they say are the shortcomings in the city's rent regulation rules.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael McKee, associate director of Tenants and Neighbors, a statewide organization that lobbies for tenants' rights, accused the administration of ignoring the loss of moderately priced apartments from the city's rent regulation system as a result of vacancy decontrol. He faulted Mayor Bloomberg for failing to take on the State Legislature to try to regain local control of the rent regulation rules -- a fight that others doubt the city could win.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It doesn't do any good to build a few thousand units when you're losing hundreds of thousands of units,'' Mr. McKee said. ''It's like one step forward and five steps back. The failure of the mayor to fight for home rule over our rent laws the way he fought for control over the schools will prove deadly to the future of the city. It's going to be a market-rate town. It means there won't be any affordable rental housing.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shaun Donovan, the commissioner of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, said the administration had produced a net gain in affordable housing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many housing advocates who praise the mayor's efforts have been especially admiring of Mr. Donovan, who remembers being at Yankee Stadium as a child during the 1977 World Series when Howard Cosell, the sportscaster, famously observed that the Bronx was burning. Mr. Donovan became fascinated by urban policy and poverty at Harvard, then embarked upon a career in low- and moderate-cost housing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the time Mayor Bloomberg appointed him in 2004, Mr. Donovan had earned two master's degrees and had worked for a private mortgage lender, had served as acting commissioner of the Federal Housing Administration in Washington, and had been a managing director of a mortgage capital company, overseeing $1.5 billion in debt and equity investments in subsidized low- and moderate-income housing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outlining his housing plans for a second term in office, Mayor Bloomberg two weeks ago proposed building or preserving an additional 100,000 homes for poor and moderate-income New Yorkers by 2013. Among other things, he said the administration would create a new city agency to finance the construction of rental apartments for families with incomes between $50,000 and $100,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the plan, the city would also make greater use of inclusionary zoning. And it would intervene to insure the continuing affordability of apartments in privately owned low- and moderate-income buildings with state and federal subsidies that are expiring.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think the mayor seems to be very much focused on affordable housing,'' said Shaun M. Belle, president and chief executive of the Mount Hope Housing Company, which develops and manages housing for low-income people in the Mount Hope and Morris Heights sections of the Bronx. ''That as a policy mandate is important to us because it sends a signal that he is in tune with the fact that the average person in the city finds it extremely difficult to pay for housing.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For decades, the city's affordable housing policy centered largely on selling off its inventory of blighted property, taken through tax foreclosure in the 1970's and 1980's and then made available for development as low-income housing. The program was so successful, however, that the land ran out; the Bloomberg administration announced in August that it was selling its last 248 lots.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city's population, meanwhile, has climbed to an all-time high. Real estate prices have risen sharply. According to Mr. Bach, 65 percent of poor households pay more than half their income in rent. And thousands of apartment buildings built several decades ago with federal and state subsidies in return for renting to low-income tenants are now becoming eligible to leave the programs and start charging market-rate rents.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Confronted with the shortage of land and the strong housing market, the Bloomberg administration has ''upzoned'' three major areas -- Hudson Yards and West Chelsea in Manhattan, and Greenpoint-Williamsburg in Brooklyn -- to encourage development. Under pressure from community groups, it adopted inclusionary zoning provisions under which developers can build at higher densities if they include some percentage of lower-cost units.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To help finance an estimated 30,000 homes for low- and moderate-income New Yorkers, the administration and five major foundations, including Rockefeller and Ford, also set up the New York City Affordable Housing Acquisition Fund. The aim is to provide speeded up access to loans and loan guarantees for land acquisition and predevelopment expenses borne by developers of low-income housing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the administration has proposed another fund, the New York City Housing Trust Fund, made up of $130 million in Battery Park City Authority revenues. That money is to be used to subsidize housing for households with incomes well below the area's median household income as well as to buy up portfolios of ''at-risk properties,'' buildings in danger of slipping out of the affordable category, including buildings with expiring subsidies.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the city's Housing Development Corporation, which provides financing programs to create and preserve low- and moderate-income housing independent of the city budget, now has $4.8 billion in bonds outstanding, up from $2.8 billion in 2001. The agency makes available low-cost mortgages through the sale of bonds, as well as subordinate mortgages through its own corporate reserves.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The private market will be increasingly important going forward,'' said Emily A. Youssouf, the investment banker whom Mr. Bloomberg appointed president of the agency in 2003. Ms. Youssouf has worked to reinvigorate the agency; her predecessor, Russell A. Harding, a Giuliani administration appointee, was sentenced in July to more than five years in prison for embezzling more than $400,000 from the agency.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among other things, the Housing Development Corporation has put in place new programs to ensure that some 59,000 Mitchell-Lama apartments remain affordable to the middle class. The agency has issued $235 million in bonds to fund refinanced mortgages, lent $57.5 million from corporate reserves for capital improvements, and financed the rehabilitation of 6,500 units.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you're going to provide for a city that continues to attract immigrants and that continues to attract a mix of people, then you have to provide not just one kind of housing opportunity but a myriad,'' said Mr. Frey. ''You have to provide for middle income, moderate income, younger couples starting out, lower-income families who continue to be vital in providing services and working in the city. That's the kind of mix that you want to see from an administration, and I think they have done that.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EVELYN AND DON LEWIS lived through a typical suburban life cycle in the town of Ridgefield: they had children, watched them grow and watched them leave. Then, they saw younger families move in with small children.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At that point, they thought it might be time to find a new place to live, in keeping with their post-child-rearing lives. ''We were looking for a neighborhood with people we could share more in common with,'' Mrs. Lewis said. They found it in Newtown in a place not far from their old neighborhood, but a world apart otherwise, because children are not allowed to live there.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Towns call them age-restricted developments; marketers call them active-adult communities. Whatever the label, their numbers have grown explosively in Connecticut in the past several years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Jane O'Connor, the editor of Mature Living Choices, a housing guide for those 55 and older, there are three areas in New England that are ''white hot'' for such developments: southern New Hampshire, the Boston area and the entire state of Connecticut.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Connecticut, more than 7,000 units of housing aimed at buyers 55 and older, including both apartment-style condominiums and single-family homes, are for sale in about 150 new neighborhoods, Ms. O'Connor said. (While the State of Connecticut does not track how many active-adult communities have been built, Ms. O'Connor's company, 55 Plus L.L.C. of Hawley, Mass., has done numerous surveys of towns within Connecticut to reach its totals.)   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This growth has come in part in previously unmined upscale markets, including Litchfield and Fairfield Counties, and in shoreline towns like Madison, where a proposed development of $500,000 to $1 million homes is awaiting a permit for its own sewage treatment plant.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That 127-unit development, Madison Landing, is the latest flavor of 55-and-older complexes, serving up a town-within-a-town theme. Single-family detached houses, town houses and apartment-style condominiums will be part of a new village that includes a community center with an exercise room, a swimming pool and dining facilities. It will even have its own post office. The condominiums there are 1,200 to 1,900 square feet; the attached town houses, 2,000 to 2,500 square feet; the single-family homes, 1,850 to 3,000 square feet.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A survey by 55 Plus L.L.C. this year found that the average square feet for 55-and-older developments built in New England in recent years was 1,907, up from 1,200 square feet four years ago. ''It's a direct evolution of this product line,'' Ms. O'Connor said. ''We know some of the homes being offered in this market are supersized, with some going toward 3,000 square feet.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers are also marketing more upscale amenities to these home buyers, as many are moving from larger homes. Those buyers do not want to feel as though they are leaving anything behind except for large lawns that need mowing in warm weather and long driveways that need plowing when it snows.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That means their new homes have granite countertops, washers and dryers on the main floor, luxe master bathrooms -- often bigger and better than their old houses had -- more open spaces, and, in apartment-style condominiums, elevators.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What we're finding is that we're getting a number of empty nesters who have larger homes with larger grounds who want to downsize their property size but do not want to give up the fine craftsmanship and quality of the residences they're in,'' said Monica Quigley, vice president for sales and marketing at LeylandAlliance, a firm in Tuxedo, N.Y., that is developing the property. ''The focus on design is paramount to us.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Design has become increasingly important to older home buyers, who are often looking at a preretirement or retirement purchase as an opportunity to buy their dream home.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. and Mrs. Lewis, who are both 64, moved from a 2,500-square-foot colonial-style home on half an acre to a 2,100-square-foot one-floor condominium at Liberty at Newtown in September of 2004. They said they originally had concerns about moving to a condominium, particularly because they wanted to be able to accommodate their children and grandchildren.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They chose the garden level, which sits below the main level of the condominium, because it offers a space for residents on that level to garden, and they face the woods.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't feel the loss of space, with the high ceilings and spacious open rooms,'' Mrs. Lewis said. Her new master bedroom is larger than the one in her Ridgefield house; she has a granite-topped kitchen island she did not have in Ridgefield; and her master bathroom is bigger than she could have imagined if she had built it herself.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Liberty at Newtown, which has 96 units, seems to be serious about trying to appeal to active residents; it has 37 acres of trails, a clubhouse, a fitness center and a swimming pool as well as a library. Prices range from $564,900 to $744,900.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But developments with so many units are more an anomaly than the norm, Ms. O'Connor said. In Litchfield County, which has been far slower than Hartford and Tolland Counties in developing 55-and-older communities, several new developments are going up.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indian Knolls, on 16 acres surrounded by the Bantam River in the town of Litchfield, is offering 18 colonial-style single-family houses ranging from $495,000 to $638,000. It will not have a clubhouse or any of the other amenities the larger developments have, but the developer, CT Adult Condominiums of Connecticut, is betting on the lure of Litchfield and the desire of many older residents to stay near home but in a luxurious space, said Jill Wolowitz of Prudential Connecticut Realty, the sales agent for Indian Knolls.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're charting new paths here, because there is nothing up here of this quality for 55 and older,'' Ms. Wolowitz said. ''These neighborhoods are really up and coming. Every day, you read about another active adult community being built. They're popping up all over the place.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes rose in September from the previous month, but prices dropped and the number of homes for sale increased, the government reported yesterday, in another sign of some softening in the housing market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home sales in September rose 2.1 percent from August, to an annual rate of 1.22 million, but that was slightly below sales in September 2004, the Commerce Department said. The median price -- at which half the homes sold for more and half for less -- fell 5.7 percent from August, to $215,700. Still, prices were up 1.9 percent from a year earlier. Also, the August home sales figure was lowered to 1.197 million from the 1.237 million reported initially.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September, homes on the market rose 3.1 percent, to 493,000, a 4.9-month supply. That was up slightly from August and almost 20 percent from September 2004.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales were strongest in the Midwest, up 24.9 percent from August, and the South, up 5.6 percent. In the Northeast, the region with the least new-home-building activity, sales were down 20 percent, and in the West they were down 11.8 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report came two days after the National Association of Realtors said sales of existing homes were unchanged in September. New and existing home sales data do not move in tandem because the Realtors count an existing home as sold when a contract is closed, while new home sales are counted when the contract is signed. New home sales make up 15 percent of the market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said both sales reports showed that the housing market had lost some steam this fall but remained at an elevated level.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's certainly consistent with the idea that the upturn has ended,'' James O'Sullivan, an economist at UBS, said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since home sales hit records this summer, mortgage rates have climbed steadily -- reaching a national average of 6.15 percent for 30-year fixed-rate loans this week, up from 5.53 percent at the end of June, according to Freddie Mac. The Mortgage Bankers Association said on Wednesday that its weekly index of loan volume was down 7.9 percent for the week that ended Oct. 21.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are definitely headed for record home sales in 2005,'' David F. Seiders, the chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders, said in a statement. ''However, the pattern of sales in recent months suggests that the new home market may have tapped out around midyear, a conclusion consistent with findings from our builders surveys.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even stabilization in home sales could affect the economy, analysts say, because rapidly rising home sales and mortgage refinancing have driven up consumer spending and generally made people more well off. ''This has important implications for overall growth,'' Mr. O'Sullivan said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, durable goods orders fell 2.1 percent in September, after jumping 3.8 percent in August, according to the Commerce Department, as orders for military equipment and airplanes dropped. Excluding the transportation sector, orders for durable goods -- those that last more than three years -- fell 1 percent last month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daniel J. Meckstroth, chief economist of Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, a research and consulting group, said September was unusual because of a strike at Boeing and Hurricane Katrina.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, the Labor Department reported yesterday that claims for unemployment insurance fell to 328,000 last week, from 356,000 the week before, as applications from people displaced by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita continued to drop. Jobless claims dropped by 24,286 in Louisiana and 7,336 in Mississippi.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By VIKAS BAJAJ  </div><div>690 words</div><div>26 October 2005</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2005 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales prices for existing homes fell last month and total sales stayed flat, according to a report released yesterday, providing further indications that the housing boom is starting to cool.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total home sales were still at their second-highest pace on record in September, the National Association of Realtors said, as people displaced by Hurricane Katrina snapped up homes in nearby cities with the help of employers and quick-moving mortgage lenders.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other reports, consumer confidence in October fell unexpectedly for the second consecutive month as Americans grew more pessimistic about higher energy costs and the prospects for finding new jobs later this year, the Conference Board reported yesterday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales in September were unchanged at an annual pace of 7.28 million, second only to 7.35 million homes sold in June, the National Association of Realtors reported. But the median price -- meaning that half of the homes sold for more and half for less -- fell 3.6 percent, to $212,000. The price of condominiums and co-ops fell more steeply, dropping 4.6 percent, to $213,600. Home prices are still up 13.4 percent since September 2004.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data appear to corroborate other recent reports showing sales stabilizing, prices dipping and homes staying on the market for a slightly longer period.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It would be difficult to go much more beyond the current housing activity,'' said Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America in New York. ''It's not troubling that we would see a flattening in home sales and housing starts.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage interest rates, a major factor driving home sales in recent years, have climbed in recent weeks: the national average for a 30-year mortgage was 6.10 percent last week, up from 5.77 percent in January, according to Freddie Mac.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low rates and the increase in interest-only and adjustable-rate mortgages have made home buying more affordable, and they also appear to have increased speculative buying and selling of condominiums and second homes in some hot housing markets.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said the data showed that the housing market was gliding to a slower but more sustainable pace. ''The demand is still there,'' said David A. Lereah, chief economist for the group. ''I think some people may be pausing, they may be looking to see the shape the market is in. They will come right back in springtime.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales were strongest in the South, up 3.7 percent, to an annual pace of 2.83 million, and Mr. Lereah said the data indicated that a surge of transactions in cities like Baton Rouge, La., more than made up for lost sales in New Orleans and other devastated regions.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data from the National Association of Realtors measures the closing of sale contracts. Hurricane Katrina made landfall at the end of August and the fact that so many people were able to close on homes in nearby cities in September was surprising.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Anecdotally, we are getting reports that employers are going out of their way and helping their employees relocate and buying some of this inventory in places like Baton Rouge,'' Mr. Lereah said. Lenders may also have accelerated home closings to help evacuees, he added.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales fell in the West, down 4.1 percent, and the Midwest, down 3 percent, while the Northeast eked out a 0.8 percent gain. There was a 4.7 months supply of homes on the market, unchanged from August but up from 4.2 months last year. There was a 5.3 month supply of condos and co-ops, up from 4.3 months in September 2004.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for consumer confidence, the Conference Board reported that its index fell to 85 this month after it plummeted to 87.5 in September from 105.5 in August.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers said they were more optimistic about the current situation than they were about the coming months, when heating bills are expected to soar. Economists had expected the confidence index to turn up to 88 this month, according to Bloomberg News.  </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Slippery Devil, That Real Estate 'Bubble'   </span>
</div><div class="author">By MOTOKO RICH and DAVID LEONHARDT   </div><div>1094 words</div><div>23 October 2005</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2005 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JUST about everybody has taken to using the word ''bubble'' when talking about the housing market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the optimists who have embraced the idea is a condominium developer in Miami who is running an advertisement for two new properties that shows a woman blowing an enormous chewing-gum bubble above the word ''Boom!'' And at the Mortgage Bankers Association, the chief economist, Doug Duncan, says he subscribes to the Don Ho way of thinking, referring to the singer's hit, ''Tiny Bubbles.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the pessimists aren't surrendering the metaphor they started. Robert Shiller, an economist whose 2000 book predicted the stock market crash, has re-released the book with a new cover warning of ''the world wide real estate bubble and its aftermath.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of which leads to the question: Does the word ''bubble'' have any meaning anymore?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some cases, the word indicates a market in which prices have gone up so far and so fast that they are destined to crash, as some fretted when a recent report showed that Manhattan apartment prices had dropped 13 percent from July through September.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others use ''bubble'' to suggest that prices could drift along for years to come. They might trail inflation for as much as a generation, even if the nature of real estate, with its slow and infrequent transactions, prevents a Nasdaq-like collapse.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To many developers, brokers and bankers -- not to mention homeowners -- who all have a big stake in the boom, the word has come to symbolize a fabulous market that is likely to slow eventually. The 15 percent annual price jumps of recent years will gently ease into 5 or 8 percent increases, they say.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even some who insist there is no bubble in real estate use a similar metaphor. David Lereah, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors and the author of a recent book urging people to buy more real estate, said ''air will come out of the balloon'' in coming months.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is still not clear who will end up being right about house prices, but the vast housing industry has already chalked up one victory by muddying the linguistic waters like this. If the true worrywarts convince you that there is indeed a bubble, but real estate agents tell you that it is not so bad, you might just go ahead and buy a vacation home with no money down.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Grant Barrett, a lexicographer for Oxford University Press in New York, compares this obfuscation to the linguistic tactics of politics.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's that weird behavior of trying to make a word mean what you want it to mean,'' Mr. Barrett said. ''We call it the thesaurus defense: it's basically redefining a word in order to suit their own point of view and in order to make themselves feel right or sound right.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be fair, there is no precise economic definition of a bubble, and uncovering one in the housing market is particularly tricky. When the same question came up about the stock market in the late 1990's, the terms of the debate were clearer. People who used the word ''bubble'' generally meant that stock prices would soon fall sharply, which they did.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the real estate market is not nearly as volatile as the stock market. Deals are not done in a day. When house sellers cannot get the price they want, they often wait, instead of panicking. The worst declines in real estate values usually happen over years, often at the hands of inflation rather than in the form of a sudden decline.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That means that even popped bubbles do not always go by that name. During the most recent real estate downturn, in the late 1980's and early 1990's, prices fell by more than 10 percent in New York and more than 20 percent in Los Angeles, according to the National Association of Realtors.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adjusted for inflation, the losses were far worse: about 30 percent in parts of the Northeast and even more than that in Southern California. Prices peaked in about 1988 and did not return to their highs -- relative to the price of everything else in the economy -- until about 2000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Boston, where prices fell 25 percent in the early 1990's, after adjusting for inflation, ''people were bringing checks to the table'' to cover shortfalls in selling prices because their mortgages were larger than what the buyer paid, said Robert Buckley, a real estate lawyer in Boston.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet there is far less talk today about the 1990's real estate crash than there is about the 2000 stock market crash, despite the current obsession with housing. Slow declines are simply not as memorable, and real estate agents like to talk in terms of list prices, which present a sunnier if less meaningful picture than inflation-adjusted numbers do.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't believe real estate acts in any way that could be a bubble, because a bubble pops and real estate doesn't explode overnight,'' said Pamela Liebman, chief executive of the Corcoran Group, one of New York's largest real estate firms. What happened in Manhattan in the first half of the 1990's, she said, was ''a slow leaking.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adding to the current confusion is a flurry of recent statistics that have pointed every which way. The Commerce Department reported last week that the number of homes starting to be built last month surged more than 10 percent compared with a year ago, a sign of builder optimism. But the number of existing homes for sale in several markets, including New York, Boston and Washington, is also rising, as is the average amount of time it takes to sell a home. In Manhattan, the recent fall in apartment prices caused The New York Post to exclaim, ''Real Estate in Bubble Trouble.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taken as a whole, the numbers suggest that the hottest markets really are cooling off, in a way that seems more serious than other pauses of recent years. Still, both versions of the boom's end -- the gentle one and the harsh one -- look possible. So both definitions of bubble remain in play.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the average homeowner, though, a definition of bubble that avoids all these subtleties might be the best one of all. ''Anyone who bought after you bought,'' suggests Erin McKean, editor in chief of the Oxford American Dictionary in Chicago, ''bought in a bubble.''   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HERE are the stories of four towns the housing boom forgot.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their house prices have sat still or crept up slowly while values across the country raced past them at gold-rush pace.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For some people, these cheap markets represent the last true bargains in America. Bit by bit, families are relocating from expensive towns to affordable ones, drawn by the good housing stock and low home costs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To understand the lure of these overlooked markets, it helps to begin with the median price of an existing home nationally-- $220,000 -- and see what it buys in these four locations. Go west, to Billings, Mont., and you can buy that median house and still have $80,000 left over. Head south, to Spartanburg, S.C., for an even better deal -- housing prices there are about half the national median. In upstate New York, the cheapest market in the Northeast, $220,000 will get you two houses in Binghamton and leave $40,000 to furnish them. In Youngstown, Ohio, you could buy almost three houses.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's nothing compared to the rest of the country -- nothing,'' said Billie Briggs, a real estate agent in Binghamton, N.Y. ''We're still very affordable. I have schoolteachers who are looking to buy houses in the $70,000 to $85,000 range. A lot of times, people can buy mansions.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As with any cheap investment, homeowners in these areas risk buying a seed that will never sprout. Houses are inexpensive for a reason. Often, local economies are depressed, the population is aging and shrinking, and the cities are far from cultural and economic hubs. Families who have moved to these towns for their affordability say it has been painful to leave behind family and friends, yank their children from school and move to places that are physically remote and culturally foreign. Some have contemplated moving back.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But day by day other transplants said they are making their decisions work.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Binghamton, N.Y.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median price: $93,000  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though home prices in Binghamton have grown 10 percent since 2002, the city remains one of the cheapest metropolitan housing markets in the Northeast, according to the latest quarterly index by the National Association of Realtors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like Rochester, Buffalo and other struggling upstate cities, Binghamton saw its housing prices stagnate as the local economy shed nearly half its manufacturing jobs over the last 15 years. That trend may be starting to turn around, however. In the last few years unemployment levels have dropped and now stand at 4.7 percent, and real estate agents say housing prices are showing some bounce.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jim and Loretta Beals, a retired couple living on Long Island, are now trying to buy a ranch house in Binghamton before the prices bounce too high. After living in various parts of New York, they had retired to Long Island to be close to their children, but Mrs. Beals said she and her husband are weary of living in a two-room apartment attached to their children's home in Lindenhurst.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Sometimes you just want a little more room,'' said Mrs. Beals, who worked for the state Department of Motor Vehicles and Department of Correctional Services before retiring. ''We couldn't afford to buy a home on Long Island, and the apartments are very expensive to rent,'' she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple began looking along Interstate 81 and near the Pennsylvania border. The commuter suburbs of New York City were too expensive, and Syracuse was nice, but too far away. Towns of 2,000 and 3,000 people were simply too quiet, Mrs. Beals said. Binghamton was affordable, and a four-hour drive from Long Island -- just close enough.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, two newlyweds, Rita and Scott Morgan, are reaping the economic benefits of buying in Vestal, in the Binghamton area, where Mr. Morgan got a job at the State University of New York. Ms. Morgan sold her three-bedroom town house in Wappingers Falls in Dutchess County for $215,000 and bought a larger home upstate for $160,000. It is a 1936 Cape Cod that sits on a half acre, and Ms. Morgan said she plans to put $20,000 into renovations. The rest of the profits will go toward the couple's savings and big-ticket purchases like furniture and a riding lawn mower.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's all-around much nicer,'' Ms. Morgan said. ''We're on a dead-end street in a beautiful section. We did very well.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Billings, Mont.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median price: $142,500  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the online economy burst in 2001, Kim Backstrom found herself out of work and unable to afford her condominium in the San Francisco Bay area. She scraped for 18 months doing freelance graphic design work, but she ultimately put her condo on the market and began looking for a cheaper place to live.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'd done some research in the Internet and found out that I could make a good living and afford a good lifestyle'' in Montana, Ms. Backstrom said. ''It was kind of a crazy whim.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She wanted rocks, views and a dry climate, but not the unyielding heat of the Arizona deserts. She also wanted to buy a home that didn't require a large mortgage. Missoula was too expensive and other towns were too remote, so Ms. Backstrom bought in Billings, which the real estate firm Coldwell Banker this year named the cheapest market in Montana.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She had sold her 1,300-square-foot condo in San Francisco for $325,000, and started looking for comparable condos in Montana until her real estate agent stopped her and described the buying power of $325,000 in Billings. Ultimately, she found an 80-year-old house downtown that covered 2,600 square feet and sat on half an acre. It cost her $140,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Backstrom found a job designing advertisements for The Billings Gazette and hikes through the hills on weekends, but she said she sometimes feels unmoored, isolated from her old social and cultural nexuses. In San Francisco, culture seemed to drive to her doorstep. In Montana, she said, she has to prospect for it.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was definitely an adjustment,'' she said. ''I questioned, What am I doing here? I should have given poverty a try in California. Maybe it wouldn't have been so bad. I'm missing out on the sense of class and glamour. I feel like that's absent.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spartanburg, S.C.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median price: $118,700  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spartanburg used to be called Textile Town before the factories were shuttered and a new BMW plant became the city's main hope for economic health. The National Association of Realtors calls it one of the cheapest markets in the South, where the median home price has ticked up a mere 3 percent since 2002.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was those housing prices and the possibility of work at that BMW factory that lured Shirley and John Coleman to South Carolina from North Brunswick, N.J.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple, in sight of retirement, recently began considering how old age would affect their financial health and living standards. Could they pay their $7,000 annual property tax bills with pensions and Social Security? Were they happy with their social network?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then Mr. Coleman lost his job with Electrolux and Ms. Coleman, 53, had to quit her job in December for medical reasons. Suddenly, economic circumstance had decided. They would sell the house and move south, where land was cheaper and where their family once lived.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's just so hard now,'' Ms. Coleman said. ''The mortgage, the insurance, the car insurance and the taxes were just outrageous. We had to change our ways. We couldn't go out like we used to. Things just got really tight.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They began driving south. Virginia wasn't far enough for Mr. Coleman, so the couple visited North Carolina and looked at some ''really nice houses'' in Raleigh and Durham. Nothing captured their attention, so they continued on, landing in Spartanburg.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They pounced on a foreclosure deal, paying $85,000 for a four-bedroom house with a large kitchen and a $600 annual property tax bill. The Colemans sold their house in New Jersey for $260,000, enough to pay for a roof and a kitchen floor in their new house, with plenty left over.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We don't have the big bills,'' Ms. Coleman said. ''It'll be a different environment. We're ready for that, too -- ready to slow down.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Youngstown, Ohio  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median price: $82,900  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Youngstown was an escape hatch for the Kaplin family.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three years ago, Ken Kaplin lost his job developing stealth technology, but he and his wife, Sherri, decided to stick it out at their home in New Haven. The Kaplins' children were in school and the family had a well-formed social network through their Orthodox Jewish synagogue.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But three years passed with no job prospects for Mr. Kaplin, and the pressure of caring for children and aging parents forced Ms. Kaplin to give up her job as a certified nurse's assistant. With each month and each mortgage payment, the family carved itself more debt. They decided they had to sell the house, buy in a cheaper market and use the equity to pay their bills and survive until Mr. Kaplin found work.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kaplin began cross-checking cities with affordable housing against cities with Orthodox synagogues, quickly narrowing his search to Ohio. They discovered Youngstown, a struggling Rust Belt city whose economy is propped up by an aluminum factory. Home prices have dropped nearly 3 percent since last year, according to the National Association of Realtors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They needed a house within walking distance of a synagogue, one that would be big enough for Mr. and Ms. Kaplin and their two daughters, and the husband and wife's two aging mothers. And they needed the house to cost less than $200,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August, they bought a 2,800-square-foot colonial for $169,000. Previously owned by a doctor, it is just outside Youngstown, in Liberty Township, and has six bedrooms and a finished basement, Mr. Kaplin said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kaplins' 6-year-old daughter took the move in stride, but they had problems placing their 15-year-old daughter in the right classes at school. She fell behind in her classes and has struggled to adjust to a new state where she knows no one, but has been making progress.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kaplin is looking for work in any field he can, as a truck driver, teacher or banker. The New Haven house remains a millstone.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kaplins gambled, buying in Ohio before selling their ranch-style home, on the market for $320,000. Once they close that deal, they said, they'll at last be free.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THERE are many signs that could signal the end of a speculative bubble: increased market volatility, shifts in economic fundamentals, galloping investor euphoria. And then there is David Denby.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Denby, a film critic for The New Yorker, was looking for a quick killing in early 2000 when he jumped into the stock market -- just as the technology boom was peaking. He then watched his portfolio fizzle as boom turned to bust, a process he chronicled in his book ''American Sucker'' (Little, Brown, 2004).  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Mr. Denby has entered the Manhattan real estate market, putting his two-bedroom apartment on West 72nd Street up for sale for $1.1 million. Hmmm. Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But maybe real estate will be kinder to Mr. Denby than stocks were.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Denby's stock market travails had a real estate angle as well. He got into the market in the hopes of making enough money to buy out his ex-wife's share of their marital apartment, on West End Avenue, after they broke up. But his stock picking led only to ruin and the couple finally sold the unit in mid-2003 for $1.5 million, Mr. Denby said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said that they paid about $460,000 for the apartment in the mid-1980's.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After bowing to the inevitable, Mr. Denby bought himself the two-bedroom, 1,100-square-foot co-op on West 72nd Street, at the lower end of Riverside Park. He paid $617,000 in early 2003. ''It was a wreck,'' he said. ''It hadn't been touched for 45 years.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Denby spent about $140,000 to gut it and fix it up, putting in a new kitchen and plenty of built-in bookcases. ''It's a kind of writer's paradise,'' he said. ''It's light, it's quiet, there's a lot of book space, and music space.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He lived there with his son, Thomas, who went off to college this fall, and then just over a year ago he was married again, to Susan Rieger, an associate provost of Columbia University. Now, they are looking for a larger place to share, and Mr. Denby has put his apartment up for sale. He has listed the apartment with Sherry Matays, a senior vice president with the Corcoran Group.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he no longer dreams of instant riches.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm cured of my stock mania,'' Mr. Denby said. ''I'm very conservative these days. But this is not about investment. This is about finding a place large enough for two grown-ups, settled in their ways, where sons and daughters can visit.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added: ''All New York stories become real estate stories.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New Real Estate Math  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOW much does combining two apartments add to the sale price? A banker and his wife on Park Avenue are betting that it adds a lot.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brendan Dillon, an executive with UBS, and his wife, Eva, bought an eight-room apartment on the fifth floor of 655 Park Avenue, at 68th Street, several years ago. The building is a co-op and city records do not show the sale price, but it was on the market for $2.1 million in April 2000, according to listing data shared by real estate brokerage firms. Then, last July, city records show, the Dillons closed on the apartment directly below theirs. It had been listed for $3.7 million with Eileen N. Mintz, a broker at the Corcoran Group.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Mintz said that the building requires all apartments to be offered internally to other residents before they hit the open market and that the Dillons had taken advantage of this provision to buy the unit directly from the previous owner. Because there was no broker's fee, it is likely that they paid less than the listed price.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, without doing the work to join the two apartments, the Dillons have put them up for sale together for $15 million -- making the theoretical whole worth more than double the sum of the parts.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartments together could be configured into a duplex with five bedrooms, a library, a formal dining room, a media room, an eat-in kitchen and ''ample staff quarters,'' according to the listing, posted online by Elizabeth Lee Sample and Brenda Powers of Brown Harris Stevens. Each apartment has a working fireplace.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's very hard to find that kind of space in a prewar building uptown, and families really want big spaces today,'' Ms. Sample said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to listing the two apartments together, the Dillons have listed the fourth-floor unit on its own for $4.85 million -- at least $1 million more than they paid for it three months ago. Melinda Ely Dubow, a Corcoran agent, shares the listings.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dillon declined to discuss his real estate dealings.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building, which dates from the 1920's, has an unusual layout for Park Avenue. It occupies the full block between 67th and 68th Streets and is built in a C-shape around a central courtyard garden.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Bursting Bubble? Never Mind.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE bubble has popped! Long live the bubble!  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much was made in recent weeks of brokerage and appraisal reports that the average price of a Manhattan apartment had tumbled in the third quarter, suggesting that the real estate market had reached a turning point. But averages can be deceiving, and data on closed sales in September suggests other interpretations. A new report on the Manhattan market by Halstead Property shows that the average price of an apartment -- excluding lofts -- fell considerably in July and then rose in both August and September.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everybody's saying it's starting to get bad, but August and September were better than July, so how's it getting worse?'' said Gregory J. Heym, vice president and chief economist for Halstead. ''It's not a way to prove that there isn't a market decline, but it certainly has to put into question that the market is getting worse.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Halstead report shows that the average apartment price fell to $1.115 million in July from a high of $1.33 million last June. It then rose to $1.145 million in August and $1.187 million in September. The median price -- the point where half the apartments sold for more and half sold for less -- also fell, to $725,000 in July and August from a high of $831,250 in June, then rose again to $749,000 in September.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report was based on 667 co-op and condo sales that closed during the month. The average price in September was 12 percent higher than the previous September and the median was 15 percent higher than the sales figures from the same month a year ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report by Brown Harris Stevens evaluating 2,380 sales in the third quarter, also produced by Mr. Heym, was released earlier this month, showing that the average apartment price had dropped 10.8 percent from the previous quarter, although it was still higher than the third quarter average a year earlier. Data from other brokerage firms showed similar declines.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with other signs of a slowdown, including reports of increased apartment inventory and apartments taking longer to sell, the drop in the average price led some observers to predict an end to the boom market of the last few years. But the average largely reflected a decrease in the number of very high-end properties that had closed in the quarter (for instance, Rupert Murdoch bought a $44 million apartment on Fifth Avenue, and it closed in May).  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other segments of the market held their own. One-bedroom apartments made up 43 percent of the third-quarter market, according to the Brown Harris survey, and their average price rose 1.7 percent from the previous three months, and 17 percent from a year earlier.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By Floyd Norris  </div><div>654 words</div><div>22 October 2005</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2005 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE housing boom in the United States has survived 11 rate increases by the Federal Reserve. Lately it has faced jawboning from Fed officials who warn bankers not to ease lending standards too far and caution homeowners that, as one Fed governor, Donald L. Kohn, said this week, ''a substantial slowing in the pace of house-price appreciation seems inevitable.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But on the same day that Mr. Kohn pointed to ''scattered and mostly anecdotal'' signs that the housing market was cooling, the Commerce Department reported that builders started 183,000 homes in September, notwithstanding the impact of Hurricane Katrina. That was more than expected, and made the month the strongest September in three decades.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing has been in a prolonged boom. The total number of housing starts is not unprecedented; it is in fact lower than the peak reached in late 1972, when a boom was nearing an end that would be worsened by a totally unexpected rise in oil prices. But what is unprecedented is the mild nature of booms and busts in the housing market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It used to be common to see start volume rise and fall by huge percentages. In the spring of 1975, with a deep recession ending, the number of houses started over the previous 12 months was off 37 percent from the figure of a year earlier. In the fall of 1983, as the economy emerged from recession, housing starts were 66 percent above where they had been a year earlier. But in the last decade, the annual gains or losses in housing starts have never exceeded 14 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is different now? One factor is the way houses are financed. It used to be that banks and savings and loan associations made mortgage loans, and they would be cut off when the Fed pushed up interest rates above the levels the banks could pay on savings. But those rules are long gone, and the Fed cannot turn the housing market on or off.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, as the current boom shows, the Fed has some trouble even slowing a boom. Long-term interest rates have not risen with the short-term rates the Fed does control, and the financial system has responded with creative mortgages that let homebuyers hold down monthly payments even as the purchase price rises.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although overall housing starts remain lower than their peak in the early 1970's, that is in part a result of the changing nature of the housing market. When overall starts hit a record in 1972, 44 percent of the starts were in apartments and other multifamily buildings. The latest figures show just 17 percent of the starts in multifamily units. Single-family homes are being built at the fastest pace ever.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the Fed worried about speculative excesses in housing, it would dearly love to slow the boom without bringing on a bust reminiscent of the old days. Builders know what the Fed is saying, but so far they believe that customers will keep lining up to buy whatever they build.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chart: ''The Boom Lives On''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction began on more than two million homes during the last 12 months, the highest for any such period in more than 30 years. In years past, housing was very much a boom-or-bust industry, but in recent years it has shown far less volatility.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nation's economy displayed resilience in September despite two devastating hurricanes and surging energy costs, economic reports released yesterday show.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home construction picked up speed in September and permits for new building jumped, the Commerce Department reported yesterday, indicating that rising interest rates and concerns about inflation have not yet slowed the new housing market. A separate report said mortgage applications for home purchases rose last week.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And a Federal Reserve survey of the national economy, known as the beige book, said that most of the country was experiencing ''moderate or gradual'' economic growth because of improved hiring, higher wages and increased growth in several industries.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones industrial average rose 128.87 points, or 1.25 percent, to 10,414.13 yesterday. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index climbed 1.5 percent, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 1.71 percent. The stock market, which surged late in the day, was responding not only to the economic data but also to quarterly profit reports from J.P. Morgan Chase, Bank of America and Yahoo, among others.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, the markets reacted to a report showing rising inventories of oil and gasoline.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When you look through the vast majority of reports -- even the ones that are bad -- what you see is the undertow is still pretty strong,'' said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Wells Capital Management.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joshua Shapiro, chief United Sates economist at Maria Fiorini Ramirez, an investment firm in New York, agreed with that assessment. ''Basically, what they are saying is the underlying health of the economy was very good pre-hurricane and pre-spike in energy prices,'' he said. ''And it is still pretty good after those things.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts, which measure the beginning of new construction, increased 3.4 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 2.1 million, after dipping in July and August, the Commerce Department reported. New housing permits rose 2.4 percent, to an annual pace of 2.1 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed's survey reported robust hiring in financial, professional and technical services and even cited labor shortages in industries like trucking. But it also noted concerns about rising energy prices, particularly higher home heating bills expected this winter, and the potential for weaker consumer spending and broader inflation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Clearly, retailers are very nervous,'' Mr. Shapiro said, noting the early Christmas promotions.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts and investors have been closely monitoring the housing sector to gauge the effects of higher interest rates. Some reports have shown that housing prices in some cities have fallen in recent months and that homes are staying on the market longer.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists had expected housing starts to fall to an annual rate of 1.97 million and building permits to dip to a pace of 2.08 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest data confirmed some economists' belief that home sales and prices are likely to remain at a fairly high level, without seeing the explosive growth rates of recent years or the sharp drop that some analysts have predicted.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The market is strong,'' said Ken Mayland, president of ClearView Economics, a research firm based in Pepper Pike, Ohio. But, he added, ''I think we are in the final throes of these superstrong housing start numbers.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increased construction activity was not spread evenly across the country: housing starts were up 6.9 percent in the South and 1.9 percent in the Midwest, but unchanged in the West and Northeast, where the boom has been strongest until recently. Permits rose the most in the West, Northeast and Midwest, and fell in the South.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed's beige book also said it was difficult to get a clear national picture on housing. Federal Reserve branches in Chicago, St. Louis, Dallas and San Francisco said activity was expanding or staying strong. But Boston and New York reported homes were not selling as fast. The Atlanta branch, which covers the Gulf Coast, said demand was strong in areas that have drawn evacuees from the hurricane-damaged areas.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home-building activity on the Gulf Coast is expected to pick up later this year and early next year. The areas affected by the storm make up just a small portion of the Southern economic region, 2.4 percent, according to the Commerce Department.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another report yesterday, from the Mortgage Bankers Association, said loan applications for home purchases were up 7.3 percent last week. The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage was 6.03 percent last week, about a quarter-point higher than at the start of the year, according to Freddie Mac. Rates on five- and one-year adjustable rate mortgages have increased by half a point.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Exceptionally low mortgage rates, combined with the rapid growth in interest-only and adjustable-rate loans, have allowed more Americans to buy homes in recent years. They have also been blamed by some analysts for helping to feed regional housing bubbles.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have some indications that housing markets are cooling off, although the signs are scattered and mostly anecdotal,'' Donald L. Kohn, a Fed governor, said in a speech in Pittsburgh yesterday. ''A substantial slowing in the pace of house-price appreciation seems inevitable as prices reach high levels relative to interest rates, rents and incomes.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Citing the strength in the economy and rising prices, Mr. Kohn also suggested that the Fed would continue to raise interest rates. The Fed has raised the short-term fed funds rate that determines overnight borrowing costs between banks 11 times since June 2004. It now stands at 3.75 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The beige book, which policy makers will consult when they meet next on Nov. 1, noted strength in the labor market, construction industry, manufacturing activity and lending.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Economic Scene column in Business Day on Thursday, about the high cost of housing, referred incorrectly to a tax that might be one way of controlling prices. It is a 10 percent tax on housing values, which would theoretically push prices down 10 percent -- not a 10 percent increase in property taxes (which are typically a small fraction of a house's value).  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Wed Oct 26 2005   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TO paraphrase Yogi Berra, it seems that houses are now so expensive that no one can afford to own one.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, economists know better. In the short run, the supply of housing in most areas is more or less fixed. Hence the price of housing is determined primarily by the demand side of the market -- by how much people are willing to pay for housing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last few years, we have seen historically low mortgage rates, which feed directly into housing demand. In several locations, particularly on the East and West Coasts, where land-use restrictions make it difficult to increase the supply of housing, prices have been pushed up to unprecedented levels.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether these low mortgage rates have created a housing price bubble has been a matter of debate. There is no universally accepted definition of a ''bubble'' in economics, but the idea is that a significant part of the demand for housing is based on an expectation of future appreciation. The more prices go up, the more people want to buy so as to reap the gains from expected future price appreciation, pushing prices up even more.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is quite possible that there is some ''froth'' in the market, to use Alan Greenspan's term, particularly on the coasts. But even when the froth subsides, housing will remain quite expensive in those areas. Can anything be done?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some municipalities have started subsidized housing programs that provide various types of assistance to new homeowners. Unfortunately, such programs just increase demand even more, pushing prices up. In fact, in an ideal market with a constant supply of housing, a 10 percent subsidy offered to a broad segment of the market would simply push housing prices up by 10 percent. The out-of-pocket, after-subsidy price would end up right where it started.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you really wanted to push housing prices down, you would increase taxes on housing. Analogous to the imposition of a subsidy, a 10 percent increase in property taxes would push housing prices down by 10 percent. Of course, the total cost of the housing (purchase price plus the present value of the taxes) would be unchanged, so this really does not solve the housing cost problem either.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In California, tax policy has played a significant role in housing price dynamics. Proposition 13, passed in 1978, limited property tax increases to 2 percent a year for owner-occupied homes. But when the house is sold, the property tax assessment is based on the sale price. This means the new owner typically faces a significantly higher property tax bill than the old owner.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Proposition 13 has been called a ''tax on moving.'' Indeed it is, since a homeowner in California is much better off remodeling than moving. It is a lot cheaper to add a bedroom to a three-bedroom house than to buy a similar four-bedroom house because of the tax treatment of renovations as compared with new sales. For the same reason, empty-nesters have strong tax incentives to keep their houses, regardless of whether they need all that space.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result is that fewer houses come on the market than would otherwise be the case, pushing prices up even more for the limited stock of housing that is available.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, if you intend to move out of state, these considerations are not so relevant. In California, the best thing for empty-nesters to do is to sell their nests and migrate to Oregon. This seems to have become a pretty common practice, at least in some demographic groups.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what is the answer to high home prices? Basic economics tells us that for housing prices to fall we have to see a reduction in demand or an increase in the supply of housing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is some hope on the demand side. As interest rates rise, we should see some moderation in demand; indeed, it appears that housing prices are flattening out in some areas.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultimately, the only reliable way to make housing more affordable is to increase the supply. But a new house requires land zoned for housing. We cannot make more land, so we either have to use the land we have more intensively or we have to build houses farther from jobs. Both of these options are unattractive.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In urban California, traffic has become increasingly congested, putting a limit on how far away from their jobs people can live. Land use restrictions are tight in many desirable residential areas, and political forces are aligned against relaxing these restrictions.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Imagine someone who scrimps and saves to buy his dream house in an area zoned for one-acre lots. The last thing he wants to see is his neighbor's lot being subdivided to build two or three new houses. Not only would it affect his quality of life, but, even more important, it would also affect the value of his house.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zoning laws and land use restrictions are unpopular among those seeking less-costly housing since they push up the price. But by the same token, once a searcher becomes an owner, he often becomes a fervent supporter of such restrictions. As Pogo put it, ''We have met the enemy and he is us.''  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE incessant talk of housing bubbles and of rising interest rates, which will make homeownership even less affordable, has some investors focusing on the rental markets.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is there a big upswing in the works for apartment owners as more people put off home buying? And what, in particular, will this mean for dividend-paying real estate investment trusts with portfolios of rental apartment properties?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already, rental vacancies have been creeping lower, according to the latest Census Bureau data, which puts the nationwide rate for buildings with five or more units at 10.2 percent in the second quarter versus 11.8 percent a year earlier. And the National Apartment Association, which represents multifamily housing companies, reports that owners are increasing rents in some regions because of a stronger job market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All this augurs well for publicly traded apartment REIT's, whose stocks have risen in the last two years despite the growing trend toward homeownership. Still, market analysts are split over the investment prospects for the sector over all.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent report by Friedman Billings Ramsey, an investment bank in Arlington, Va., paints a somewhat favorable picture for landlords, forecasting that ''the next round of interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve will put a damper on housing affordability and, hence, sales growth and pricing power.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Standard &amp; Poor's remains more cautious, noting that weakness in the home-selling market ''could dramatically improve the REIT outlook,'' but an oversupply of housing in general could have a negative impact as well. Comparing new construction with household formation, it estimated that 630,000 excess units would be built this year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many money managers are not making any big moves for now. ''We're a tad lower,'' Samuel A. Lieber, the chief executive of Alpine Management and Research, said of his funds' exposure to the apartment sector. The Alpine U.S. Real Estate Equity Fund has around 2 percent of its portfolio holdings in apartments, and the Alpine Realty Income and Growth Fund has 10.1 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lieber says he thinks any changes in the coming months will be incremental, ''not dramatic.'' Besides, he said, ''the stocks are not cheap.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ralph L. Block, a senior portfolio manager for the Phocas Financial Corporation, an asset management company, agreed. ''This is one of the few sectors of real estate that could benefit from rising interest rates,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he added that investors seemed to have already factored that into apartment REIT stock prices, as more economists contend that a housing bubble exists in many parts of the country, especially around big cities on the East and West Coasts.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apartment REIT's have been outpacing REIT's in general. For the first nine months of this year, the sector returned 9.54 percent, although by last week it was up only 2.54 percent, after a 34.72 percent return in 2004, according to the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts. The average return on the trade association's composite index of all REIT's, by contrast, was 6.94 percent for the three quarters and 30.41 percent for 2004. By last week, it was minus 1.36 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the economic pressures working against apartment REIT's, some companies, like AvalonBay Communities and Archstone-Smith Trust, have managed to profit handsomely from the red-hot home-buying market by selling rental properties to developers for condominium conversions. Others, like Equity Residential, have even formed units to convert their own apartments into condos.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first nine months of this year, 108,181 existing rental units were sold to developers for condo conversions, according to Real Capital Analytics, a New York consulting firm. In 2004, there were 75,606, and in the previous year, 22,078.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Market analysts expect more condo conversions in 2006, though not at the same frenetic pace as this year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It wasn't widespread in all markets,'' said Bryce Blair, chairman and chief executive of AvalonBay, which is based in Alexandria, Va., ''just in higher-cost markets, like Washington, D.C.; New York; California; and South Florida.'' Of AvalonBay's $500 million in asset sales expected for this year, he said, 90 percent are to condo developers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Archstone-Smith of Englewood, Colo., meanwhile, sold more than $2 billion in apartments over the last two years or so, and a large portion went to developers, according to the company's chairman and chief executive, R. Scot Sellers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Every year, we look at our portfolio and identify the buildings that we think will pay us a price that allows us to improve our portfolio and obtain better long-term returns,'' he said. ''With the money that we've raised, we have bought other apartment buildings.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Raymond Mathis, who covers REIT's for Standard &amp; Poor's Equity Research, calls condo conversions a temporary blip on the earnings radar screen that does not really change the fundamental problem that many apartment REIT's face: supply and demand. (Analysts say the mass evacuation in the hurricane-ravaged gulf area isn't expected to have a significant impact on the apartment REIT market because the cities that evacuees are moving to in large numbers tended to have vacancy rates that were already high.)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conversions can benefit owners of multifamily projects, of course, by shrinking the supply of rental apartments, though some of the converted units could end up as rentals again and compete once more in that sector.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Market watchers think that some REIT's are better positioned than others, pointing, in particular, to companies like AvalonBay, Archstone-Smith and BRE Properties, that build luxury rentals in pricey housing markets like California and the Northeast.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This summer, Archstone-Smith broke ground on the Mosaic, a 627-unit high-rise building in Manhattan's Clinton neighborhood, and it has four apartment projects under construction in Southern California, including the 522-unit Archstone Warner Center in Los Angeles. Two years ago, it completed the 354-unit Archstone Playa del Rey.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AVALONBAY is working on Avalon Chrystie Place, a four-building mixed-used project that will include apartments, at Houston and Chrystie Streets on the Lower East Side.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They develop primarily in markets where housing affordability is the most constrained right now,'' said Craig Kucera, the senior multifamily REIT analyst for Friedman Billings Ramsey.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One potential problem, though, could be rising expenses. Higher construction and labor costs may cut into profits, analysts say.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Sellers of Archstone-Smith says he is confident that his company has chosen wisely in deciding where to do business. ''You have to have job growth, plus expensive single-family homes, plus a low supply of new apartment rentals,'' he said. ''That's been the formula that we followed for many years, and it has worked well.''  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SEVERAL reports this week gauging the temperature of the housing market are expected to show a continuation of the easing that persisted through the summer.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts are estimated in a poll of economists by Bloomberg News to have fallen to 1.97 million units last month from 2.01 million in August. Their peak this year of 2.23 million units occurred in February.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits, a predictor of construction down the road, are estimated to have declined to 2.07 million in September from 2.14 million a month earlier. Those reports, as well as one on mortgage applications, are due to be released on Wednesday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet another indicator of the sector's health is the Housing Market Index, compiled by the National Association of Home Builders from surveys of construction firms. A reading of 64 is expected when the October report is released on Tuesday, compared with 65 in September and a high for the year of 72 in June.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan Golub, a strategist at J.P. Morgan Funds, warned that several permutations of the housing numbers could worry Wall Street traders of a nervous disposition.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Evidence of a significantly deepening slowdown could stir fear that consumers, who have so much of their wealth tied up in their homes, will slash spending. On the other hand, a pickup in housing activity could provoke concern that there will be no letup in Federal Reserve interest rate increases.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Golub's prediction is for none of the above, but instead a set of numbers that point to a benign easing in the growth of home prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Every single thing is pointing to real weakness, but not a collapse, in housing prices,'' he said. ''Home values aren't going down. They're simply not going up.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If such modest weakness continues, he said, ''things leveraged to real estate development may take a hit,'' such as shares in construction companies, but he added that their valuations suggest that investors are already anticipating a bout of sluggishness.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What you're likely to see is a flattening in home-equity values for a reasonably long period of time,'' Mr. Golub said. ''Given how much people have made on their houses, they should count their blessings.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DATA WATCH -- The week begins with the release Monday of the ''Empire State'' report, the New York Federal Reserve Bank's assessment of business conditions at factories in New York, which traders take as a hint of the strength of manufacturing nationwide. Economists in Bloomberg's poll anticipate a reading of 19.0 for October, up from 17.0 last month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Producer prices for September are due on Tuesday. An increase of 1.2 percent is expected, or 0.2 percent after food and energy prices are removed from consideration.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, leading economic indicators for September are scheduled to be released. A decline of 0.5 percent is forecast, after a 0.2 percent decline in August.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Graph tracks housing starts (monthly, in millions) for 2004 and 2005.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HAS it finally arrived, the end of Manhattan's real estate orgy, the autumn of our discontent? After four years of record-breaking prices and consistent growth, brokers and sellers are examining the latest sales data and wondering whether they indicate a stall, a pause or an insignificant blip.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So it's time to shake the Magic 8 Ball and ask: Is the party over?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some signs point to yes. New market data show that the number of sales in the third quarter dropped 17.8 percent compared with the same quarter a year ago. Average prices fell some 12 percent, or about $160,000 per apartment, from July to the end of September while median prices dipped only 3 percent, or $25,000. Apartments are spending longer on the market, and inventory is building up. Sellers are cutting prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is a standstill situation,'' said Jacky Teplitzky, a broker with Prudential Douglas Elliman. ''We all thought September was going to be a strong month, but that did not happen. The phones did not ring. Turnout at the open houses was low, lower than we had expected.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are these just the summer doldrums, the slow exhale after a barn-burning spring? It's difficult to say. In the last 10 years, third-quarter posted gains over the second quarter five times; the other five, they showed a slump, according to data from Miller Samuel, an appraisal firm.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, any dark signs may be false harbingers. If the Manhattan market is pyramid-shaped, with a few $10 million and $20 million properties at its apex, the broad base of cheaper studios and one-bedrooms seems to be as strong as ever. Average sale prices for large apartments -- four bedrooms or more -- plunged some $2 million over the last three months. Luxury inventory built up and top-shelf apartment sales, whose stratospheric prices can skew averages, dropped off sharply.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data from Brown Harris Stevens show the number of new listings this September was 60 percent higher than a year ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, prices for studios and one-bedrooms leapt by 10 percent. Brokers say there has never been a stronger demand for studios.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And over all, home prices in the city are still up 10 to 12 percent over last October.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Corcoran Group said that this August was its busiest ever, and brokers are expecting robust Wall Street bonuses to buoy the high end of the market. Lisa Maysonet, an Elliman broker, said she sold three-fourths of a loft conversion in Bushwick, Brooklyn, in a single weekend. Many brokers are still moving properties and insist the Manhattan market remains fundamentally strong.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Caught in the middle of these currents are the brokers who tend empty open houses like farmers waiting for rain, the cautious buyers wary of entering a peak market and sellers who cannot fathom why no one wants to buy their once-coveted homes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take the case of Randall Trombley, a portfolio manager at Bear Stearns, and his floating one-bedroom at 100 United Nations Plaza, overlooking the spires of Midtown. Mr. Trombley had lived in the 1,242-square-foot condo since April 2001 and wanted a larger apartment with another bedroom, so he listed his home for $1.33 million in August and waited for the offers to roll in.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first week, buyers dangled offers of $1.2 million and $1.15 million, but never made formal bids. Others said he should lower the price by 10 percent, or praised the apartment and left without making an offer. Two weeks ago, Mr. Trombley sliced his price by $86,000, and said he may cut it further still.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm beside myself,'' he said. ''I feel like I'm caught in the crossfire here. I have a high-floor apartment priced right around what the average has been, and we're not even getting into a negotiating stance. It's crazy. It's like, what are they waiting for?''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are waiting for prices to drop, said Pamela Liebman, the chief executive of the Corcoran Group. The last four years were a sellers' bacchanalia, with average prices rising 70 percent, to a peak of $1.317 million in July from $778,575 in 2001. Even as the market has tempered, sellers still expect prices of $2,000 per square foot.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When you see things that have stalled, it's because of price,'' Ms. Liebman said. ''The million-dollar one-bedroom is not a fact of life. It exists, but it exists in special buildings with something that is beyond the ordinary.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Douglas Elliman market report released last week showed that prices are starting to recede as units sit longer and longer on the market. The median apartment price citywide dipped to $750,000 from $775,000 over the last three months while the mean price -- a simple average -- fell to $1.1 million from $1.3 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bigger the apartment, the worse it fared. Two-bedrooms fell by 3 percent, three-bedrooms by 9 percent and apartments larger than that took a 35 percent price hit, according to the Elliman report.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan J. Miller, whose appraisal firm, Miller Samuel, conducted the study, said the slow rise in mortgage rates, coupled with anxiety about gasoline prices and bubble warnings from the Federal Reserve, had compelled buyers to lock in at the low end of the market but kept richer buyers away from the high end.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Duke-Semans mansion, a $50 million town house on Fifth Avenue, is still on the market. A $70 million penthouse at the Pierre Hotel remains up for grabs. In the second quarter, 17 homes sold for $10 million or more; last quarter there were four such sales. ''Our interpretation was there was a pause or a pullback,'' Mr. Miller said. ''It just seems like all these external factors made everybody take a breath. We're not used to that. If we see another drop for the next couple of quarters, you may see something more negative.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The season's new buzzword is negotiability. The gap between what sellers ask for their apartments and what they will accept is slowly widening, said Ronald Tardanico, the sales manager for Bellmarc Realty's East Side office. In February, an average apartment in the listings represented by Mr. Tardanico's office sold for 1.68 percent higher than the asking price. Last month the average was 2.68 percent below asking price.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tardanico said sellers were still overestimating the worth of their apartments, such as a couple asking $100,000 more than the market would bear for a one-bedroom in NoLIta. ''Nobody's looking at it, and nobody will look at it,'' Mr. Tardanico said. ''A lot of sellers are inclined to try it at an overly optimistic number, and if they're not getting the money, they come back a bit.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carmen J. Cook, a vice president at Halstead Property, said she is aiming to ignite interest in a two-bedroom in the West 50's by slashing the price from $975,000 to $899,000 -- about 8 percent. Forty blocks north, another Halstead broker, Brian Lewis, is trimming $20,000 off a $559,000 one-bedroom to sell it quickly.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm not a pessimist,'' Mr. Lewis said. ''I just feel that the buyers that are out there from last spring are bruised. They're circling the pool and just putting their toe in.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The longer an apartment sits on the market, the more negotiable it becomes. Apartments now spend 133 days on the market, a month longer than they did three months or a year ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Janice Silver, a vice president at Bellmarc, said she persuaded the sellers of a two-bedroom on Madison Avenue in the East 60's to drop their asking price by $150,000 after the apartment lingered for five months with no takers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For brokers, the long marketing times mean they must pay more for advertising and spend more weekends at open houses and showings. Some firms are coping with the new market with seminars on how to bargain and how to sell during a slump.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Last spring it was a whirlwind,'' Ms. Silver said. ''No matter what youput on the market, it sold in a second, and you didn't even have to think. You don't see that now.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Except if you're trying to sell a studio or one-bedroom. The Elliman report showed studios rising an average of 13 percent this quarter and one-bedrooms by 10 percent. Combined, these sales represent 55 percent of all apartments sold in Manhattan.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The demand is there, and the supply isn't going up,'' said Gregory J. Heym, an economist with Brown Harris Stevens. ''It's just been solid growth.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As larger apartments float out of range, average buyers naturally turn to smaller, cheaper apartments. And as that demand grows, square-foot prices for studios have risen while the higher square-foot prices for larger units decline. Brokers said that studios are also being gobbled up as homeowners combine apartments within buildings.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Heym's numbers showed that, for the first time, studios and one-bedrooms sold for the same price per square foot, $879. The gap between two-bedrooms and studios shrunk by $17 per square foot over the past year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These new buildings, they're not building studios,'' said Richard Hamilton, a Halstead broker who specializes in Chelsea studios. ''They're ignoring a market.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's likely to happen next? With the city forecasting Wall Street profits at $14.4 billion, some say big bonuses will keep the market strong. Others say new inventory will drive down prices, spur buyer interest and rekindle sales numbers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others say it's simply all about value, and when the price is right, things will move.  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A real estate slowdown that began in a handful of cities this summer has spread to almost every hot housing market in the country, including New York.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More sellers are putting their homes on the market, houses are selling less quickly and prices are no longer increasing as rapidly as they were in the spring, according to local data and interviews with brokers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Manhattan, the average sales price fell almost 13 percent in the third quarter from the second quarter, according to a widely followed report to be released today by Miller Samuel, an appraisal firm, and Prudential Douglas Elliman, a real estate firm. The amount of time it took to sell a home was also up 30.4 percent over the same period.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another sign that the housing market might have reached a peak, executives at big home builders have sold almost $1 billion worth of company stock this year. [Page C1.]   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outside Washington, in Fairfax County, Va., the number of homes on the market in August rose nearly 50 percent from August 2004. In the Boston suburb of Brookline, Mass., where many three-bedroom houses cost $1 million or more, the inventory of homes for sale has increased in just the last few weeks, said Chobee Hoy, a broker there.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For-sale listings have also swelled throughout California, according to the California Association of Realtors. In the San Francisco Bay area, they have increased 16 percent in the last year, Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are seeing a market in transition,'' Leslie Appleton-Young, the association's chief economist, said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers said that some houses seemed to be on the market longer because sellers priced them too high, assuming that their value was still rising sharply. In other cases, people who otherwise would have waited a year or two to sell their homes -- like empty nesters ready to move into smaller quarters -- had listed them now out of fear that prices would soon fall.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question remains whether all of this represents a momentary cooling off of some overheated housing markets, or it presages a more pronounced downturn that would end a decade-long boom.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists and commentators have for years predicted the bursting of a real estate bubble, and previous slowdowns have turned out to be relatively brief pauses before prices started accelerating again.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with mortgage rates now rising, the cost of gasoline hovering at or near $3 a gallon and house prices in some areas out of reach for many families, brokers and analysts said they thought that this slowdown could be the real thing.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, the change remains a far cry from the bursting bubble that some have predicted.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Massachusetts, for example, the median house price remained flat from July to August, and the median condominium price fell only slightly, according to the Realtors' association there. At the start of the year, prices had been rising at an annual rate of more than 15 percent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If anything, some brokers said, the recent slowdown meant a return to a healthier, more sustainable market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What we had was abnormal,'' said Dottie Herman, chief executive of Prudential Douglas Elliman. ''People get used to abnormal times and then when they're normal, they think there's something wrong.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alexander Shakhov, 47, listed his two-bedroom house in Frederick, Md., an outer suburb of Washington, for $529,000 in July, and it remained unsold for the rest of the summer. A   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">month ago, he reduced the price to $499,000 at the suggestion of a broker. A week ago, Mr. Shakhov accepted an offer at the lower price.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market ''is not as hot as the last two years,'' Mr. Shakhov, a scientist at a biotechnology company, said, ''but I'm pretty happy.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He bought the house three years ago for $230,000. He now lives in Cleveland, where he has bought a home that is nearly twice as large as his Frederick house for less money.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cooling off has forced both sellers and real estate agents to begin changing their attitudes about residential property, many said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Houses that are priced too high are sometimes on the market for weeks or months now, rather than fetching even more money than their owners had imagined they could get.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Manhattan, the average sales price of co-op and condominium apartments fell 12.7 percent, to $1.15 million, in the three months that ended on Sept. 30 compared with the second quarter, according to the Prudential Douglas Elliman report. The median sales price -- which means half of homes sold for more and half for less -- fell 3.2 percent, to $750,000.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the average sales price was 10 percent higher this summer than it was a year earlier, according to the study.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, housing prices rose at the fastest rates since 1979 in the 12 months through August, the National Association of Realtors said last week.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the changes that real estate agents have seen in recent weeks -- increased inventories and longer sales times -- have often preceded market slowdowns in the past.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason properties are remaining on the market longer is that sellers still expect to reap double-digit price appreciation each year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What will slow this market down, and has slowed certain segments of the market down, is overpricing,'' said Pamela Liebman, chief executive of the Corcoran Group, a large real estate firm in New York. ''Back in the spring, there was such a frenzy that very pedestrian product was drawing multiple bids.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of today's sellers appear to be pricing their homes as if the frenzy were continuing.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Their neighbors sold their house when the market was red-hot, and everybody thinks their house is better than their neighbor's house,'' said Maggie Tomkiewicz, the president of the Massachusetts Association of Realtors and a broker in South Dartmouth. ''But when the neighbor sold, there may not have been five other houses on the market'' in the area.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slowdown has also jolted the thousands of people who have become licensed brokers in the last few years. Until now, many of them knew only galloping price appreciation.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've gotten these calls from newer agents saying: 'I've had this property on the market for 60 to 90 days. What do I do?''' related Buzz Mackintosh, an owner of Mackintosh Realtors in Frederick, who has been selling houses for two decades. ''And I say, 'It's called, 'Reduce your price.'''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indications of a slowdown have appeared before. Jonathan Miller, president of Miller Samuel, said the last time that average and median sales prices dropped below those the previous quarter at the same time that inventories and sales duration rose in Manhattan was in the fourth quarter of 2002. But by the end of 2003, the market had come back.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An important difference now, though, is that mortgage rates are creeping up, whereas previous comebacks have been fueled by ever-lower rates.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On five-year adjustable-rate mortgages -- a popular loan with a fixed interest rate for the first five years -- the initial rate has risen to 5.59 percent on average, from 5.14 percent in June, according to BankRate.com.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is more, some mortgage lenders have started to tighten credit standards, making it harder for buyers to get loans.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Low interest rates and easy credit standards are just about over,'' said Kenneth Rosen, chairman of the Fisher Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics at the University of California, Berkeley.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is this a housing bubble, or the first baby steps in the real estate equivalent of some ''Dow 100,000'' nirvana? (A copy of the 1999 book by that name, by the way, was available on Amazon.com last week for a penny, in case that provides a clue.)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If it is a bubble, it seems likely to end not with a crash but a whimper, for it's far less practical to dump a house than a stock. (No one lives in a stock.) The whimpering will come from people kicking themselves for not cashing in when they had the chance -- or maybe from people who are ready to move now but refuse to let go of the lofty price they locked in their minds.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, could the whimpering be about to begin? Perhaps, to judge by the National Association of Homebuilders' housing market index, derived from sales, expected sales and buyer traffic.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE Manhattan real estate market can be a bewildering place, with stratospheric prices and a chorus of warnings about speculation and bursting bubbles. No wonder anxious buyers are gasping for breath.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what is the true state of the market here? Is it fueled by speculation? How much do low interest rates increase buying power? How are people able to afford double-digit price increases? Will thousands of new apartments coming on the market bring a glut that spells the beginning of the end?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the articles about the state of the market nationally fail to account for patterns in the city, where many residences are not real property, but co-ops whose sale is recorded as stock transfers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are more questions than answers, but what follows is an attempt to look at New York real estate from varying perspectives.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is Speculation Rampant?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Market bubbles, whether in stocks or real estate, are typically characterized by an increase in speculation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So is New York rife with people rolling the dice on real estate riches?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An analysis of sales going back to the mid-1980's found little evidence that flipping property is common.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study, done at the request of The New York Times by the appraisal firm Miller Samuel, which tracks both co-ops and condos, found that of 4,339 condo sales in Manhattan last year, 5.9 percent involved apartments that had been bought and resold within 18 months. Since 1997, that number has remained relatively constant, ranging from 5.9 to 7.5 percent annually.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flipping, if it goes on at all, is done almost entirely with condos, because co-op boards favor owner occupants and make the resale process too cumbersome. Figures for co-op sales since the mid-1980's show that 1.3 to 4.9 percent of all transactions each year were for apartments that were held for 18 months or less. But assuming that almost none of the co-ops were sold by speculators, those sales were most likely occurring because of situations like job transfers or changes in income -- and the same would apply to many of the quick condo sales.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only a small part of the overall sales, therefore, would be by flippers hoping for quick profits, according to Jonathan J. Miller, president of Miller Samuel. ''The way I characterize the market flip phenomenon in Manhattan is that it's a non-factor,'' Mr. Miller said. ''It's not influencing the way projects are being developed, it's not influencing the way properties are being marketed, it's really incidental to the overall market activity.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That makes Manhattan very different from markets in South Florida or Las Vegas. A study last month by First American Real Estate Solutions, a provider of real estate data, found that 36 percent of all home sales last year in Miami-Dade County, Florida, and 40 percent of sales in Clark County, Nevada, where Las Vegas is located, were for homes sold in less than two years. By comparison, only 7.1 percent of all apartment transactions in Manhattan were for units that sold twice in 24 months, according to Miller Samuel. Real estate brokers and lawyers say that flipping in Manhattan is simply too costly for much of it to be going on.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Shvo, a broker who markets new developments, said that taxes, closing costs and broker fees usually mean that a flipper must see at least a 10 percent appreciation before he will begin to profit.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How Cheap Is Cheap Money?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a truism of the current real estate boom that the surging market across the country is driven by low interest rates that allow people to borrow more money, and to buy bigger apartments and houses.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the link between interest rates and real estate prices hasn't always seemed so direct, especially when evaluated over several decades and considering inflation. It is important to consider inflation when talking about mortgage rates, economists say, because it gives a truer picture of the real value of money over time. Inflation eats away at the value of a loan over time, as well as the real cost of monthly mortgage payments, and that helps determine the overall value of a real estate transaction.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage available in the first half of this year was 5.74 percent, according to Freddie Mac, the government-chartered mortgage reseller. Economists at Freddie Mac calculated an inflation-adjusted interest rate of 3.28 percent for the first six months of 2005. That is well below the average inflation-adjusted long term mortgage rate of 4.42 percent since 1963, but it is far from the lowest during that period.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the mid-1970's, for instance, mortgage rates were in the 8 to 9 percent range, but the inflation-adjusted interest rate in 1976 was just 0.25 percent, according to Freddie Mac. The low real rates, though, did not spark a real estate boom. It was not until the following years, when nominal and inflation-adjusted interest rates began to rise, that housing prices followed suit.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From 1980 to 1990, the average mortgage rate was consistently above 10 percent. The co-op and condo market in New York peaked in 1987 and bottomed out in the mid-1990's. During most of that time, inflation-adjusted mortgage rates were falling, but they did not seem to put a brake on falling prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Markus K. Brunnermeier, an assistant professor of economics at Princeton University, said that people should make decisions on whether to buy or rent a house based on the real interest rate, that is, the mortgage rate minus inflation. Instead, they tend to look only at nominal interest rates.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Brunnermeier sees a powerful link between inflation and house price trends. When inflation is high, he says, people often make a basic mistake in their mental accounting when deciding whether it makes more financial sense to rent or buy a home. They tend to ignore the fact that rents will rise steadily with inflation, while, because of the same inflationary effect, the value of their mortgage payment will actually go down in real terms. This makes them think renting is cheaper than it is and tends to draw people away from the housing market, which in turn can help drive down housing prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When inflation is low, people make the opposite mistake. They fail to understand that, while rents will remain relatively stable, the beneficial effect of inflation on their mortgage payments will be slight. Lured by low nominal interest rates, which track the rise and fall of inflation, people jump into the housing market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are We Getting More?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Have low rates allowed people to get more home for their money? Or have they simply enabled prices to rise so much that home buyers are barely keeping up?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To answer that question, it is helpful to look at the case of a single Manhattan apartment that has changed hands several times in recent years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 760-square-foot one-bedroom apartment at 317 West 95th Street, a condo building, was chosen from recent records filed with the city. The apartment first came on the market in 1988, when it sold for $160,000. It sold again in 1999 for $161,000, and then three times in quick succession, for $260,000 in 2000, for $325,000 in 2003 and for $560,000 last August.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price of the apartment went up over the years, but at the same time interest rates were trending down. For the sake of comparison, suppose that each buyer made a 20 percent down payment and financed the rest with a 30-year-fixed-rate mortgage at the prevailing rate at the time. At the time of the 1999 sale, the average national mortgage rate was 10.32 percent, according to Freddie Mac, and a hypothetical buyer would have paid $1,153 a month. In 2000, the rate was 8.64 percent and the monthly payment would have been $1,620. When the apartment sold in August, rates stood at 5.8 percent, for a $2,628 monthly bill.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even when inflation is taken into account -- the 1989 payments are the equivalent of $1,896 in today's dollars -- the buyer today has a much lower rate but a heavier debt burden.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You have to take on a lot more debt to buy a house today,'' said Ian Morris, chief economist in the United States for HSBC, who believes real estate is overvalued. ''So even though interest rates are low, your mortgage payments are high.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is Buying Power Stronger?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everyone knows that apartment prices are going up, but what about incomes?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer to that depends on how you slice the data.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data from Miller Samuel shows the median price per square foot for all Manhattan apartments reached a high point in 1987, at $305 a square foot for co-ops and $413 a square foot for condos. What that means is that the median price for a 1,000-square-foot co-op was $305,000 -- half the co-ops sold in Manhattan cost more than that and half cost less.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices bottomed out by the mid-1990's, losing about 44 percent of their value in real terms, and then they started to rise again. By 2002, prices had passed their 1987 levels, measured in inflation-adjusted dollars and by the first six months of 2005, the median co-op price was up 37 percent from 1987, while the condo price was 35 percent greater. Averaged across the entire period, the cost of a Manhattan apartment has risen at a rate of about 2 percent a year above inflation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what happened to the median income in Manhattan during the same period?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Census data reveals that median household income growth in Manhattan was strong from 1979 to 1989, increasing 35.8 percent above inflation. But in the 1990's, median income -- the point at which half the households earned more and half earned less -- barely rose, going up just 8.5 percent in real terms from 1989 to 1999, or 0.85 percent a year. Since then, a similar rate of growth has been documented by the Census Bureau in its annual American Community Survey, which shows a 4.1 percent inflation-adjusted increase in the median income for Manhattan from 2000 through 2004, or 0.82 percent a year. The median household income last year in Manhattan was $50,731, according to the Census Bureau.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, since the last peak in the real estate market, Manhattan apartment prices have grown about one and a half times faster than median household income.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan has the greatest income disparity of any county in the country, and the census data shows that while the household income for the bottom 20 percent rose just 7.9 percent from 1989 to 1999, in real terms, the income of the top 20 percent went up 61.5 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reasoning that it is mainly earners at the top end who can afford to buy an apartment in Manhattan, a group of economists argues that, despite the galloping price increases of recent years, real estate on the island has actually become more affordable.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group, Business360, an economic consulting firm, compared the increase in apartment prices per square foot with increases in personal income for Manhattan. While real estate prices rose and fell and rose again, average personal income in Manhattan, reported by the federal government's Bureau of Economic Analysis, rose at a fairly steady pace, increasing 87 percent in real terms since 1981. The figure is very different from the median because it is an average of all earners, and with Manhattan's great income disparity, it is heavily skewed toward the top.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average income has grown faster than average prices, which since 1981 are up 50 percent for co-ops and 37 percent for condos. Because of that, the study concludes, housing is more affordable for the average Manhattanite than it was in the early 1980's or at the peak of the last real estate boom.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To show the relationship between rising incomes and prices and falling interest rates, Business360 calculated the number of days it would take for the average household to earn enough money to pay a year's mortgage payments for a 1,000-square-foot condo, at the average mortgage rate and square foot price for each year of the study. In 1987, it took 273 workdays to cover the mortgage, while today, the study concluded, it takes 152 days. The average household income for Manhattan, projected by Woods &amp; Poole Economics, is $185,993.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People look at the prices -- they're stratospheric -- and they think that that's a bubble,'' said John Marchant, one of the economists who wrote the Business360 study. ''But if they looked at what people are earning in New York, they'd think that's outrageous too.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ingrid Gould Ellen, the co-director of the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University School of Law, said: ''It really depends on who your target is when you talk about affordability. For the median earner in Manhattan, those apartments are going to be less affordable, but somebody's buying them.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Will There Be a Condo Glut?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New buildings with thousands of units, from luxury condos to below-market rentals, are going up all over New York City in the biggest building boom in years. Last year, the city gave out permits for 25,208 new units, according to the Census Bureau. That puts it firmly ahead of the last boom, in the mid-80's, when permits reached a peak of 20,332 permits in 1985.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yale Robbins, a publisher of real estate directories and surveys, said some 19,000 units, mostly condos, will be completed in Manhattan over the next two years. In addition, he said, developers have plans for as many as 27,000 units in the outer boroughs. ''My feeling is it can be absorbed,'' he said. But, he added, ''With the amount of supply coming on the market I have a hard time understanding how prices can go up much higher.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So when does a boom become a glut?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's possible but nothing I see in the current data even suggests that we're even close to that kind of scenario,'' said Shaun Donovan, the commissioner of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His agency estimates the city has a shortage of at least 135,000 homes, and probably many more. ''If you go back to the 1980's, the city was for many years losing population,'' Mr. Donovan said. ''There was a dramatic decline in population in the 1970's and that's a fundamentally different story than what we're seeing today.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In contrast, the city population grew by about an estimated 900,000 people since 1990, he said. City officials predict another 200,000 newcomers by the end of the decade. The city is promoting the building of below-market-rate housing, but Mr. Donovan said that new construction at all price levels helps alleviate the pressure on the market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In my mind,'' he said, ''the primary thing that's driving the strength of our market, and the negative effects in terms of affordability that comes with that, is our housing shortage.''  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NOVATO, Calif. -- Janice Quinci likes nice things: fashionable clothes, dinner out with her husband, a private school for her daughter. With a household income in the six figures, Ms. Quinci can pretty much enjoy it all.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the notable exception, until now, of a home of her own.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We figured we would rent our whole lives,'' Ms. Quinci said. ''We didn't really think that we could afford to have a place to ourselves.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Quinci, 29, was speaking from the front porch of her three-bedroom townhouse here in suburban Marin County, north of San Francisco. She and her husband, Vito, a salesman for a wine distributor, bought it new from a developer last November with no money down and at a steep discount. Inside, the refrigerator was pushed aside as workers laid a new kitchen floor -- at no cost to the Quincis -- because the original one was not up to snuff.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Quincis might not look the part, but they are the beneficiaries of an unusual form of public housing that is gaining popularity in real-estate-obsessed America.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some middle-class families are buying homes at budget prices made possible by government agencies, private developers, not-for-profit groups and employers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Affordable housing, once shorthand for low rents for the poor, is being stretched like never before to include homeownership for people who are more likely to have Starbucks cash cards than food stamps in their wallets. These middle-income earners, priced out of homes from Burlington, Vt., to Santa Fe, N.M., are being offered financial breaks to live in hot real-estate markets and near their jobs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our thinking is that a healthy middle class is important to the city,'' said Geoffrey Lewis, assistant director of policy at the Boston Redevelopment Authority, which has overseen the building of hundreds of units reserved for middle-income earners. ''We want to keep these people in Boston; they are the glue in the neighborhoods and the glue in the economy as well.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes called low-cost, work force or inclusionary housing, the cut-price units are most popular in places ''suffering from success,'' as one study described the cities where real estate costs outpaced incomes and where government officials, businesses and housing advocates were struggling to increase homeownership for all but the rich.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike traditional government programs intended for the most disadvantaged, the emphasis is on people with full-time jobs who earn too much to qualify for federal assistance but too little to obtain a conventional mortgage, at least not in the cities or neighborhoods where they want to live.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Typically, those household incomes are 80 percent to 120 percent of the median income, which, in expensive metropolitan areas like San Francisco, Boston and New York, can extend into six figures for a family of four.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nicolas P. Retsinas, director of the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard, said, ''In many places where housing costs have escalated, that historical social contract appears to have been voided, the contract that if you work you can find a decent place to live.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price breaks are usually not achieved through direct subsidies but a range of cost-cutting programs, including cities making zoning changes for developers, providing land at reduced cost, expediting approvals of building plans and allowing the construction of bigger and more expensive homes elsewhere.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some programs, like that of Burlington Community Land Trust in Vermont, the units are subsidized with state property transfer taxes. Elsewhere, employers and lenders offer financing packages direct to buyers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in New York City, where efforts to reach out to the squeezed middle class began decades ago with construction of Mitchell-Lama buildings, the ever-growing affordability problem has led to a flurry of new programs, city officials said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 200 blocks in the Greenpoint and Williamsburg neighborhoods of Brooklyn were rezoned in May to include incentives for developers to build housing for a range of incomes, including households earning as much 125 percent of the median, something that had previously been reserved for high-priced Manhattan.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''By creating ownership, you are giving moderate income residents a financial stake in their neighborhoods, so they benefit from the improvement rather than be hurt by it,'' said Shaun Donovan, the housing commissioner in New York.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spread of the phenomenon is too new and dispersed to be quantified, government officials and housing advocates say, and so far it occupies only a small piece of the nation's affordable housing pie. Still, it is catching the attention of home builders, city planners, educators and business people across the nation, leading to workshops and seminars on the subject as well as a spate of local laws that make it simpler for developers to offer the units.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Public and private investors are also discovering the trend. Investment funds totaling $190 million have been created in the past year in Los Angeles and San Diego Counties for the purpose of building middle-income housing in so-called urban infill areas that have access to public transportation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The funds' manager, the Phoenix Realty Group, expects to finance more than 3,000 homes in the next five years. As in many work force projects, the builders will be allowed to construct more units than typically permitted under zoning laws. The ''density bonuses'' enable the developer to make up the lost profit on each unit by selling more of them.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's an unserved niche,'' said Tammy Harpster, Phoenix's vice president for acquisitions in San Diego.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conrad Egan, president of the National Housing Conference, an affordable housing advocacy group in Washington, said the stepped up focus was due in part to a ''turnaround on the part of political leaders and office seekers'' that the market cannot provide affordable housing for many Americans, even those who are financially secure.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The picture has shifted because more and more constituents of these local and state leaders are affected,'' Mr. Egan said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lottery is under way for condominiums in a seven-story building on the harbor front in East Boston, with all 30 units reserved for people earning 80 percent to 120 percent of the median income, or as much as $99,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 550 other subsidized homes have been built in Boston over the past few years -- some in buildings where other units sell for millions of dollars -- that have been reserved for middle-income earners at prices as low as $190,000 for three bedrooms.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In South Burlington, Vt., a 60-unit condominium project opened in February, with half of the units reserved for people earning up to 140 percent of the area median income. The Burlington Community Land Trust provided a direct subsidy of $25,000 on the homes, which sold for $119,000 to $169,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As in most of the arrangements around the country, the Vermont buyers agreed to restrictions on the resale of the homes, including how much profit they could make in order to keep the units affordable.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are seven teachers in there, and a couple of them are college professors,'' said Brenda Torpy, executive director of the land trust. ''The gap between what people earn and what they can afford is really creeping up. These people are not who you would think of as low income.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Lincoln Heights, a neighborhood just north of downtown Los Angeles, families making double the county's median income, or about $100,000, are eligible for reduced-price condominiums now under construction. Without even advertising, the developer, AMCAL Multi-Housing Inc., has compiled a list of 2,000 hopeful buyers a year before the homes will be available.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not surprising,'' said Percy Vaz, the company's president. ''The alternative is for people to go out to Riverside, Palmdale or Lancaster and spend two and a half hours on the freeway.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not so long ago here in Novato, a bedroom community in Marin County about 30 miles north of San Francisco, the Quincis' household income of roughly $111,000 would have disqualified them from any housing breaks. But in Marin County the median sale price for houses in June was about $925,000. The Quincis would need to triple their income to afford that.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under a complex formula devised by Novato city officials, some new housing on the former Hamilton Air Force Base is being offered at reduced prices to people with household incomes up to 120 percent of the median.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Quincis are at the top end of that scale, meaning they had to pay more for their townhouse than families that earn less, but they qualified just the same. The couple paid $390,000, about 30 percent below market value; while single-family houses on the former base not part of the program sell at market value, recently as much as $1.8 million, real estate agents say.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Often in our culture, it is the middle class that gets left out of everything,'' said Roderick J. Wood, the city manager in Beverly Hills who held the same post in Novato when the Hamilton project was conceived. ''We wanted to help that group.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Quinci, who grew up in Novato but had been living out of town with her husband at his grandmother's house, said the special housing was the only way she could afford to move back home. A high school friend lives a few doors away, as does a high school science teacher.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We see deer out back and wild turkey, and there are rabbits in the morning,'' said Ms. Quinci, a stay-at-home mother, her year-old son cuddled on her shoulder and her 3-year-old daughter rubbing her eyes after an afternoon nap.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Preferences in Novato were offered to police officers, firefighters, teachers and other public employees, but some of the 351 affordable homes are also available to the general public through lotteries, the most recent one in August.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On lottery day, it is a lot like Christmas, said Laura Levine, the Hamilton project manager for Northbay Family Homes, a nonprofit housing company that has overseen the sales.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you're over 18,'' Ms. Levine said, ''come on down. It's a beautiful place.''  </p>

</div><div class="author">By VIKAS BAJAJ  </div><div>708 words</div><div>28 September 2005</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2005 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer confidence fell to its lowest level in more than two years this month, hurt by the devastation of Hurricane Katrina and by high energy prices, while new home sales fell sharply in August, according to two reports released yesterday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest data do not necessarily signal a worsening trend because both home sales and consumer confidence are volatile indicators that can fluctuate widely from month to month, analysts said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">History indicates that consumer confidence could rebound in a few months if the recent hurricanes do not have a lasting impact on the economy. Also, the large decline in new home sales came a day after another report showed a surprising increase in existing home sales in August.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a speech yesterday, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, credited limited government intervention in the economy for allowing the nation to survive higher energy costs. ''Most recently, the flexibility of our market-driven economy has allowed us, thus far, to weather reasonably well the steep rise in spot and futures prices for oil and natural gas that we have experienced over the past two years,'' he told an annual meeting of the National Association of Business Economics via satellite.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a speech that was largely a paean to free-market policies, Mr. Greenspan, who is retiring in January, again warned that investors were becoming too complacent about taking on risks because of the economy's ''prolonged stability.'' He further noted that the Federal Reserve may be partly responsible for encouraging risky behavior by smoothing out the economy's ups and downs through its control over interest rates.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conference Board indicated yesterday that it was beginning to find less complacency, reporting that its consumer confidence index fell to 86.6, from 105.5 in August, its sixth-biggest drop since the index was created in 1967. The decrease was larger than the 17-point decline in confidence after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, said Lynn Franco, the director of the board's consumer research center, who also noted that confidence returned to pre-9/11 levels early in 2002.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Consumers tend to be pretty resilient. It really depends on what the economic consequences are and if it's a prelude to significant job loss,'' she said of Katrina.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index is based on a survey of 5,000 households that ended Sept. 20, long enough to include the impact of Hurricane Katrina and worries about the approach of Hurricane Rita. Analysts were expecting an index reading of 95.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Katrina contributed to the higher energy costs by knocking out considerable production on the Gulf Coast. Gasoline prices topped $3 a gallon in much of the country over the Labor Day weekend and home heating bills are expected to set records this winter. Nationwide, a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline was selling for $2.813 on Tuesday, up from $2.80 on Monday and $1.886 a year ago, according to AAA.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report, the Commerce Department said new home sales fell 9.9 percent, to an annualized pace of 1.24 million, from a record-setting July, and were at their slowest pace since January. There was a 4.7-month supply of homes on the market in August, up from a 4.1-month supply in July. The median sale price, however, rose 2.5 percent, to $220,300. Economists had been expecting an annualized pace of 1.35 million new home sales.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By comparison, the National Association of Realtors said Monday that existing home sales rose 2 percent, to an annual rate of 7.29 million, in August and the median sale price hit a record of $220,000, up 15.8 percent from a year earlier. Existing homes make up about 85 percent of all home sales.''You shouldn't think that this is a sign of apocalypse now, that things are collapsing on us,'' Anthony Chan, an economist with J.P. Morgan Chase, said of the new home sales data. ''This is clearly not that. When I look at these numbers, I see that this is a year that most Realtors would be proud of.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, Sept. 26 -- With new evidence that the housing market remained red hot last month, Alan Greenspan said on Monday that the vast majority of homeowners are not yet stretched too thin.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, warned that the use of ''exotic'' mortgages could be pushing prices higher and inducing some homebuyers to take on too much risk.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as he warned about the increasing use of interest-only loans and no-money-down loans, which can become risky if interest rates rise or housing prices fall, Mr. Greenspan argued that only about 5 percent of all families have borrowed more than 90 percent of the value of their houses.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The vast majority of homeowners have a sizable equity cushion with which to absorb a potential decline in house prices,'' he said. Mr. Greenspan told a banking conference on Monday that speculation in the housing market may have spilled over into the mortgage markets as more and more people use interest-only loans and other techniques to buy homes they might otherwise be unable to afford.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The dramatic increase in the prevalence of interest-only loans, as well as the introduction of other, more exotic forms of adjustable-rate mortgages, are developments that bear close scrutiny,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though such loans have appropriate uses, he continued, they could also provide a way for marginally qualified buyers to borrow heavily and buy homes at inflated prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the event of widespread cooling in house prices, these borrowers, and the institutions that service them, could be exposed to significant losses,'' he continued.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though Mr. Greenspan said the vast majority of homeowners were not overextended, his comments on Monday were his sharpest warning yet about the proliferation of new loans that have helped push the household savings to a rate below zero. On Monday, the National Association of Realtors reported that the median sale price of existing homes hit a record $220,000 in August, up 15.8 percent from one year earlier.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes climbed 2 percent in August and reached an annual rate of 7.29 million. That was just short of the record 7.35 million, set in June.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts said there were some hints that the hot housing market may be cooling just a bit. The inventory of homes for sale edged up in August, and the amount of time that houses in many cities are sitting on the market is somewhat longer than earlier this year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many economists contend that a housing bubble is evident in many parts of the nation, especially around big cities on the East and West Coasts, and that housing affordability has declined to an unusually low level even though mortgage interest rates remain at nearly historic lows.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Greenspan's message on Monday was twofold: first, that the use of exotic new mortgages could be aggravating the run-up in prices and inducing some families to take on too much risk; second, that the finances of most households are still on solid ground.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an indication of his own intense interest in the issue, the Fed chairman cited new data that he had personally assembled in collaboration with his staff.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With only a few months left before he is scheduled to retire in January, Mr. Greenspan seemed intent on defending his legacy against critics who contend that the Fed's policy of keeping interest rates low contributed to a speculative fever in the housing market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Citing new data collected by the Federal Reserve, Mr. Greenspan noted that there was little correlation between states with the biggest increases in prices and states with the highest concentrations of multiple loans, called ''piggy back'' loans, that allow people to borrow almost the entire purchase price of a home.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the Fed data, the five states where piggy-back loans were particularly common this year were Texas, California, Utah, Oregon and Colorado. While prices in California have climbed faster than in almost any other state, those in the other four states did not climb faster than average.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, the size of the mortgage as a share of the total purchase price tends to be lower in states with the most rapid price appreciation. The reason, Mr. Greenspan hypothesized, is that people in torrid markets like Southern California are selling houses as well as buying them.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By any measure, American homeowners have taken on far more debt in the last few years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The total amount of outstanding household debt climbed at an annual rate of more than 17 percent in the first half of this year and an average annual rate of 16.4 percent over the previous four years, according to an analysis of Fed data by the Federal Markets Center, a nonprofit research organization in Virginia.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The amount of cash that people pulled out of their homes by refinancing their mortgages was equal to about 5 percent of the nation's gross domestic product last year, according to estimates by Goldman Sachs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Greenspan predicted on Monday that savings would climb again when interest rates rise and the housing market cools. Many analysts agree, but caution that spending could slow at the same time.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, Sept. 20 -- Construction of new homes slipped for a second month in August, providing fresh evidence that the housing boom may be cooling.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department reported Tuesday that construction of new homes and apartments dropped 1.3 percent last month after a decline of 1.5 percent in July. The two declines are the first consecutive ones since early 2004.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with the drops, housing construction totaled 2.01 million units in August, seasonally adjusted and annualized. It was the eighth month in the last nine that construction exceeded the two million rate.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hurricane Katrina, which hit late in the month, had little impact on the data, but analysts predicted a more adverse effect in September.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Seiders, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders, predicted that for all of 2005 housing construction would total 2.02 million units, up 3.6 percent from the pace in 2004 and the best showing in more than two decades.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For 2006, Mr. Seiders forecast housing construction would drop 4.8 percent, to around 1.92 million starts. He said he had added just 25,000 starts to that figure for rebuilding from the hurricane, expecting that the recovery effort will be stretched out perhaps as long as five years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For August, construction of new single-family homes fell by 0.5 percent, to 1.71 million units, while construction of multifamily units was down 6 percent, to 328,000 units.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By region, construction rose 13.3 percent in the West, to an annual rate of 561,000 units. All other regions posted declines in August from July.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest drop occurred in the South, where construction fell 6.6 percent, to an annual rate of 915,000 units. Analysts said unusually wet weather accounted for the decline.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction was down 5.2 percent in the Midwest, to an annual rate of 346,000 units, and down 4.1 percent in the Northeast, to an annual rate of 187,000 units.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article in Business Day on Saturday about home sellers who do not use real estate agents referred incorrectly to former rules that are at the center of an antitrust lawsuit brought by the Department of Justice against the National Association of Realtors. The association allowed members to block customers' Internet viewing of certain property listings on the Multiple Listing Service -- not a brokerage firm's access to the M.L.S. itself. Because of an editing error, the article also misidentified the cable network that carries ''Sell This House.'' It is A&amp;E; HGTV runs a similar program on staging homes.  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IT'S funny how much comfort people can derive from something as transparent as a bubble.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now that home prices in some markets are showing signs of moderating, lamentations are rising from all sides about the many bad things that may happen as a result. These include bankruptcies, foreclosures, bank failures, unemployment and recession.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately, all of this hand-wringing tends to distract from the essential truth about soaring home prices, which is that they are a bad thing. So before you become carried away with mourning, let me break the news: the housing bubble never loved you. The bubble is not even your friend. In fact, the very best thing you can say about the passing of this particular bubble is ''good riddance.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's so bad about skyrocketing home prices? Almost everything. First, they make life awfully difficult for people who aren't already homeowners and do little for people who are, because selling one inflated house only to buy another affords little profit.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's true that mounting home equity makes for a nice piggy bank, but it probably also suppresses other kinds of saving and encourages excessive debt. And it has helped addict global producers to American consumerism, because it gives Americans the confidence -- and in many cases the wherewithal -- to spend some of the inflated value of their homes. But bubbles aren't very durable. Wouldn't it be better if Asian and European domestic demand could pick up some of the slack?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sky-high home prices also divert too much capital into home building from potentially more productive uses. And these prices fuel risky, not especially useful speculation in residential real estate. Then there is the matter of sprawl: all those new homes will mean more driving, more fossil-fuel consumption and more pollution.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Excessive home prices divert human capital as well. The National Association of Realtors had 1.1 million members at the end of 2004, up from 766,560 in 2000. It's hard to believe that such an increase would have occurred if there had been no housing bubble.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, wouldn't it be better for society, and safer for our financial system, if people could buy a home without resorting to the kinds of loans -- with deferred amortization, for example, or scant down payments -- that are risky for borrowers and lenders alike? Al Mansell, president of the Realtors' association, noted recently that the median down payment by first-time home buyers was just 3 percent, down from 10 percent in the early 1980's. He added that a quarter of first-time buyers who did make down payments used gifts from their parents. But more than 4 out of 10 put down no money at all.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High home prices may contribute to social and economic inequality by making far too many places out of reach for anyone but the rich, and by making it nearly impossible for people without enormous incomes to afford homes in places with the kind of desirable school systems that can help put children onto a higher earnings trajectory.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if inflated home prices are bad, isn't the end of a housing bubble worse? Not necessarily. There is always pain associated with market adjustments. But as the economist Herbert Stein once dryly observed, if something cannot go on, it will stop. The Federal Reserve, through its monetary policy of low interest rates, has propped up real estate prices for years. Other government policies, from zoning to building codes, are doing likewise. Even Hurricane Katrina may play a role; by diverting huge amounts of construction material to New Orleans and the Gulf Coast, it could drive up the costs of new homes across the country.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My sense, though, is that home prices appear determined to fall, at least where they are most inflated. And having them fall sooner imposes lower costs than having them fall later, while delivering immediate benefits.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If prices moderate, maybe we won't gobble up open space as quickly. Lower prices will clearly deter some speculators, who will put their money to work elsewhere. And some of those real estate brokers will find something else useful to do. Best of all, people at dinner parties and soccer games will have to find something more interesting to talk about.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That alone makes the end of the housing bubble a good excuse to break out the Champagne.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By JOSH BARBANEL   </div><div>2884 words</div><div>18 September 2005</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2005 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN a few weeks, just as New York City becomes embroiled in a typically noisy mayoral campaign, most homeowners across the boroughs will receive a $400 check in the mail, and most likely a soothing note from Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, thanking them for their sacrifices on behalf of the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The check is a rebate, the second of three annual $400 payments authorized by the State Legislature to line the pockets and calm the feelings of homeowners upset by an 18.5 percent tax increase adopted at Mr. Bloomberg's request during a fiscal downturn a few years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if you get that check, expected to be mailed on Oct. 1 to those who qualify, you might want to take a look at your recent tax bills, because that $400 may not buy as much tax relief as it used to: while property tax bills in New York remain far below the legendary tax bills in the suburbs, they have been rising over the last four years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A review of individual property tax records by The New York Times shows that in the last four years, the tax burden for average owners of private homes, co-ops and condominiums has gone up far more than the $400 rebate -- an average of nearly $1,100 a year (before rebate) across the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while that is a paltry increase by suburban standards, where the bigger the rise the greater the bragging rights, many taxpayers see it as the beginning of a significant shift in the role of the property tax in New York City. Property taxes have deliberately been kept low over the years to encourage home ownership, with the local income tax making up much of the difference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It used to be that our real estate taxes could be described as ludicrously low; that is certainly not the case anymore,'' said Patricia Dolan, the president of the Kew Gardens Hills Civic Association, who lives in the small two story-detached house she grew up in on 73rd Terrace. ''We have people who are hurting.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last four years, tax bills of single-family homes have risen 62 percent, according to the analysis by The Times, including a 4.3 percent tax rate increase set to be adopted by the City Council in the next few months and applied retroactively to July, to comply with complex provisions of the state laws governing city property taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, tax bills of individual co-op and condo apartments that were higher, on average, to begin with, have gone up about 43 percent, including a 1.5 percent tax rate increase set to be adopted this fall, to comply with the property tax laws, City Council officials said. Taxes went up an average of $1,680 for condos and $943 for co-ops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Driving the tax bills are increasing property values, improved and some say more aggressive assessment practices, and a longstanding policy by the City Council to use extra revenue produced by assessment increases as extra revenue for the city, rather than reducing tax rates. And yet these increases are only the beginning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though higher market values, in the greatest real estate boom in memory, have been recorded recently by tax assessors, some of the resulting increased assessments have not been added to tax bills. By law, they are being phased into the tax base over many years -- over five years for co-ops and condos and rental apartment buildings; no more than 20 percent over five years for one-, two- and three-family homes; and 30 percent over five years for four- to 10-family buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, market values already recorded on the books of the Department of Finance, based on last year's sale prices, will eventually generate hundreds of millions of dollars in extra tax payments, in slow but steady increases for years to come: $1,300 a year, on average, for single-family houses at the latest tax rates, $1,100 a year for condos, and $615 for co-ops. (Of course, if the boom goes bust, and property values drop, much of this future tax burden could go away, too.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And with prices moving steadily upward, more such increases are likely. In the first half of this year, for instance, average co-op and condo prices in Manhattan rose 33 percent, according to Miller Samuel, a real estate appraisal company based in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Dolan's parents bought her house in Kew Gardens, Queens, when it was new in about 1940 for $6,300, with a $5 down payment from winnings in the Irish Sweepstakes (they couldn't afford the extra $350 for a garage behind the house, she said).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last four years, assessors raised the market value on her house from $277,000 to $500,400, and her annual tax bill went up 50 percent, from $2,028 to $3,040, and will probably continue to $4,355, when the current market value is phased in. Values are still rising in her part of Queens, she said, raising the fears that high taxes will destabilize the finances of elderly people on fixed incomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She described a neighbor in her 90's, a retired hairdresser who is concerned about her tax bills. ''She has to pay her taxes from whatever savings she has and her Social Security.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The story of rising taxes is similar in the most affluent neighborhoods in Manhattan, but the order of magnitude is considerably higher, especially for mansions and town houses, and the newest flashiest market-rate condominiums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taxes on Mayor Bloomberg's own 18-foot-wide Upper East Side town house rose from nearly $45,000 four years ago, to about $71,100 this year (less the $400 rebate the records show he is entitled to), an increase of 59 percent. The tax bill will eventually go up to nearly $86,000 based on the latest tax rate and the current market value, $9.1 million, up from $6.4 million four years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Owners of single-family Manhattan town houses who always thought their taxes were an outrageous bargain, when compared with the suburbs, can no longer say that. Manhattan town houses average nearly $21,800 a year in taxes this year, up $7,600 from four years ago, according to the Times study, and will probably rise to more than $32,300, when future scheduled increases are phased in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet these Manhattan homeowners are still getting a significant discount compared with their suburban cousins, because their houses, valued by the Finance Department at an average of more than $3.3 million, are worth more than the average suburban house, and their true tax rate is lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another measure of the increase in property taxes is the number of residential properties with tax bills of more than $50,000 a year. Four years ago, 196 properties were listed, compared with 547 this year, with the list topped by new condominiums at the <span class="companylink">Time Warner</span> Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The highest taxed private house on the list is the 40-foot-wide town house on East 63rd Street of Ronald O. Perelman, the billionaire financier. His taxes are now $192,000 a year, up from about $125,000 four years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Older condominiums and co-ops are protected by laws designed to dampen tax increases. For instance, they are assessed as if they were older rental buildings, based on rental income rather than their ever-rising sale prices. Then individual owners get a special abatement of between 17.5 and 25 percent off the taxes due.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, in Manhattan, average taxes on condos were up about $2,000 to about $7,140, while co-ops were up about $1,500 to $4,900, per apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But newer, luxury condos are assessed considerably higher, as if they were market-rate luxury rental buildings. And among the highest taxed is Donald J. Trump's three-story 6,000-square-foot condo atop Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue. This year's tax bill would have totaled about $188,000 for Mr. Trump. But like most other individual condo and co-op owners, Mr. Trump's apartment qualified for a 17.5 percent condo abatement, saving $32,900 in taxes. (His condo also qualified for a $400 rebate.) Four years ago his tax bill was $111,000, after a $23,600 abatement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The taxes in this city are ridiculous,'' Mr. Trump said. As for the mayor's $400 rebate, he said: ''That is just wonderful. Today that buys one tank of gas.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, Mr. Bloomberg was not shy about publicizing the rebate, posing at a center for the elderly in Queens with a giant cardboard cutout of a rebate check, with his name featured most prominently in the upper left hand corner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, the checks are scheduled to go out in the middle of an election.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked about the timing, Sam Miller, an assistant commissioner at the Department of Finance, said they would be issued the same time of year they were last year, when the timing was dictated by the date the state enabling legislation was passed in Albany.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, the rebate program was set up to make it seem as enticing as possible to taxpayers. Most homeowners pay their taxes through their regular monthly mortgage payments to their banks, which in turn pay the city. But the rebates are mailed back directly to the homeowner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, owners of co-op apartments pay their regular taxes to their co-op as part of their monthly maintenance. But the rebate checks are mailed back directly to the individual owners who qualify for them, last year, along with a note from Mr. Bloomberg. (Some co-op boards, however, impose offsetting assessments at the same time to lessen the pain of the assessment.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Owners of one- to three-family homes and co-ops and condos who use their homes as their primary residences are eligible for the rebate, but only if they owe less than $25 in back taxes for earlier years. Taxpayers already enrolled in tax exemption programs that have residency requirements are automatically eligible for the rebate. If you received a rebate last year and haven't moved, you will also qualify for this year's rebate, according to city officials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tenants who pay property taxes through their rent checks are not eligible, nor are brownstone owners who live in buildings legally defined as four-family houses, nor are investor owners of rental buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rebate was originally set to roughly equal the cost to the average homeowner of the 18.5 percent increase, but as tax burdens have since risen, so has cynicism by individual taxpayers and other public officials, who would rather see a permanent reduction in tax rates than a rebate handed out at the discretion of the government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Getting your dollars back is nice,'' said Robert Spalter, who lives with his wife, Laura, in a two-story house in Riverdale, in the Bronx. ''But I don't have any expectation that they will really roll back tax rates ever again.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dee Vandenburg, a state employee, pays only a few hundred dollars a year in taxes on her small Staten Island house, a former summer cottage. But Ms. Vandenburg, who is president of the Staten Island Taxpayers Association, said that ''at some point it is a big thing with working families and a big thing with the seniors on a fixed income.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Slattery, a senior vice president for research at the Real Estate Board of New York, an industry group, said that at a time when rising property values were being driven by extraordinarily low interest rates, it might make more sense for the city to lower rates as market values go up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But are taxes rising because values are rising or because assessors are more assertive and uncompromising? City Councilman David I. Weprin of Hollis, Queens, chairman of the Finance Committee, said that ''there is no question that assessors have been very aggressive.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is troubling,'' he said. He tells of constituents who have seen their official market values rise by 30 percent, three years in a row. He said he is always running into worried constituents who say ''if the property is worth what they say it is, I will sell it to them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response, Finance Commissioner Martha E. Stark said that her staff was ''doing what it is supposed to do, which is to accurately value properties.'' She took office just as a corruption scandal in the assessors office was laid bare, and put an end to lax assessment practices, in which, city officials said, assessors set informal guidelines, limiting the change in market values from year to year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead the city used improved computer models to estimate new values for every one- to three-family home in the city each year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many good-government groups and analysts say the rebate is bad public policy, adding one more layer of complexity and protecting one more special-interest group -- homeowners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many public officials privately agree, but find it difficult to turn down such a popular program. ''You don't hear the Democrats making an issue of property taxes,'' said Edmund J. McMahon Jr., director of the Empire Center for New York State Policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some economists and policy analysts say that, if anything, property taxes on homeowners are too low in the city, especially viewed against the backdrop of significant rises in market values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several years ago, the city's Independent Budget Office issued a study concluding that despite its low property taxes, homeowners had a tax burden that was above average in the state because of the city income tax and sales taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When you factor in all the taxes, homeowners have never gotten the break they think they got,'' Mr. McMahon said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gregory J. Heym, the chief economist for Halstead Property, a brokerage firm, who previously worked for the Real Estate Board, said he viewed the rebate as ''just a thing to appease voters.'' He said that since property taxes have been kept artificially low for homeowners over many years, many homeowners are convinced they are still getting a bargain, even as their taxes are starting to rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The sad thing for the homeowner is that property taxes should be even higher, so how can they complain,'' he said. ''It is a system that needs to be completely overhauled but probably never will be.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Details on the Study</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE New York Times study of property tax bills reviewed assessment and tax abatement records for all 996,000 tax lots in New York and computed and compared estimated tax bills for the city fiscal years ending in June 2002 and June 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The estimates include property tax rate changes under consideration by the New York City Council that would raise tax rates for residential properties and lower them for office buildings and utilities. The increases, retroactive to July 1, would be reflected in bills sent out in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The maps and summary data include only properties with valid tax bills in both years. It excludes properties for which 90 percent or more of the tax burden was eliminated because of abatements or exemptions. The tabulations, therefore, may differ somewhat from figures published by the Department of Finance. In addition, abatement data for 2006 were estimated from the previous year's data.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article on Sept. 18 about taxes in New York City described the pattern of rising property taxes imprecisely.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the time tax bills reflect higher market values and increased assessments, which will be phased in over many years, projected bills for single family houses will average $1,300 more than the total this year, not $1,300 more per year going forward; condos will end up paying $1,100 more, and co-ops $615 more.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article in Business Day on Saturday about home sellers who do not use real estate agents referred incorrectly to former rules that are at the center of an antitrust lawsuit brought by the Department of Justice against the National Association of Realtors. The association allowed members to block customers' Internet viewing of certain property listings on the Multiple Listing Service -- not a brokerage firm's access to the M.L.S. itself. Because of an editing error, the article also misidentified the cable network that carries ''Sell This House.'' It is A&amp;E; HGTV runs a similar program on staging homes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Tue Sep 20 2005   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stan and Gloria Wakefield are no fools. They built their three-bedroom house 12 years ago in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla., an oceanside resort community dotted with golf courses and picturesque inland waterways. The real estate market in the area, near Jacksonville, took off and the house, overlooking lagoons, rose in value to nearly $1 million. ''This house has appreciated almost obscenely, '' said Mr. Wakefield, a retired naval intelligence officer.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What the Wakefields did next should scare real estate agents everywhere.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They decided to put their house on the market this year, and concluded that the house would sell itself. So why pay a real estate agent a 6 percent commission? They tried negotiating a lower commission with prospective agents, who stood to make about $60,000, but the best they could get was 4.5 percent -- and 5.5 percent if the agent had to share the commission with a buyer's agent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They chose instead to list their property with one of the many real estate services that are challenging conventional brokerage firms, in this case, Assist2sell.com, an agency that charges a flat fee instead of a commission. The Wakefields had an offer within six days and sold their home for $985,000, paying a $10,000 fee to Assist2sell and $14,775 to the agent who brought in the buyer, for a savings of about $30,000 over a conventional broker.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Enough to pay off the boat,'' a 26-foot pocket cruiser, Mr. Wakefield said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is subversive stuff. Homeowners across the United States are figuring out that they do not need to pay what agents demand and they may not need an agent at all. At the same time, technology is giving consumers tools to nearly circumvent the agent. If enough people try it, agents are at risk of losing a good portion of their commissions -- $100 billion last year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, agents are doing whatever they can to keep home sellers from paying less.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anyone who wants to know how to outfox them first has to understand where they derive their power: information. They know the market -- or presume to know it -- and help set the price of your house. They serve as the go-between and, again presumably, know how far you can push the other side.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(Note, however, that agents don't always push for the best price. Steven D. Levitt, co-author of ''Freakonomics,'' and Chad Syverson, both University of Chicago economists, found that real estate agents have an incentive to persuade their clients to sell their houses too cheaply and too quickly because a few thousand dollars more in price won't yield them a significantly higher commission.)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But more than anything else, agents control access to the Multiple Listing Service, where all the houses for sale in a community are listed. The M.L.S. is the most powerful tool in real estate because it informs the widest pool of buyers that a home is for sale. Not open houses, not fliers, not big ads in the newspaper. ''The M.L.S. is king,'' says Brett Weinstein, an Oakland, Calif., discount broker who prefers to be called ''a full-service reduced-fee agent.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The M.L.S. is also a tool that agents use to protect their commissions. The problem for agents is that some of their colleagues are offering to list houses for a small flat fee, sometimes for less than $500. You sell it yourself, though you would be obligated to pay a 3 percent commission to any agent who brought you a buyer -- in essence paying that agent for all the Sundays spent showing other houses to clients who never bought anything. That half-price deal is dangerous enough for a full-commission firm. But it gets worse.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In every community there are agents who open the M.L.S. to the public on the Internet (erealty.com has a fairly comprehensive list, or you can go directly to realtor.com, the Web site of the National Association of Realtors). They do it as a service to clients who want to buy a house -- 70 percent of homebuyers now peruse listings on the Internet, the association's most recent survey says -- as well as to cut their costs of showing clients the paper listings. Some even rebate part of their commission to buyers who do their own research on prospective homes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some buyers just freeload. (The Internet has a way of encouraging this behavior.) They can search the M.L.S. for a house with no brokerage firm listed, meaning it's being sold by the owner, and then work out a no-commission deal directly with that owner. So you can see where this is headed. If agents want to protect their commissions, they have to restrict access to the M.L.S. to sellers who are working with them, not going it alone.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local realty groups have tried suing agents or brokerage firms that put ''for sale by owner'' listings in the M.L.S., accusing them of copyright infringement. Those agents have countersued, charging restraint of trade. Then two years ago, the Realtors association found what it thought was a better solution. It passed rules that essentially allowed a local M.L.S. service to block access to the listing service to any brokerage firm who discounted commissions or who posted listings for homeowners who intended to sell their own houses. The antitrust division of the Justice Department cried foul. This month it sued the Realtors' trade group, asserting that the rules stifled competition and hurt consumers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors changed the rules just as the federal case was filed. But J. Bruce McDonald, deputy assistant attorney general, said that the group's policies continued to discriminate against innovative brokers and ''stifle competition at the expense of home buyers and sellers.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a news release, the Realtors association said it was ''at a loss to understand'' the Justice Department's legal action. ''Many of the changes incorporated in the new policy are in direct response to concerns they have raised over the course of the two-year investigation," it said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have successfully fought state real estate boards that tried to limit consumer choices by imposing service requirements or forbidding commission rebates, but the fight goes on. Realtors have lobbied for and won state laws that prohibit commission rebates to buyers and require minimum levels of service, like requiring that an agent handle all negotiations or house showings. Federal regulators can't fight that.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aaron Farmer, a discount real estate broker in Austin, Tex., has battled local and state realty boards to offer cheaper services. The Justice Department and the F.T.C. intervened to help him. Nevertheless, he has had to raise his fees to $700 from $600 because of the minimum service levels required by a law recently passed by the Texas Legislature. (Eight states have enacted such laws, accepting the real estate industry's argument that they are needed to protect consumers.) ''All of these fights are over the M.L.S.,'' he said. ''They don't want price wars.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But price wars are coming. No doubt about that. Here are a few suggestions on how to take advantage of the changing environment to sell your home with minimum services from -- and fees to -- a broker:  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Set the price  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Being a nosy neighbor is still the best way to know the market. Walk though every open house and find out later what the house sold for.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the shy or decorous, technology offers an alternative. Homesmartreports.com will give you a sales analysis of your home based on prices for comparable homes in the immediate neighborhood. The $25 report is far more useful than cheaper versions from Domania.com (free) or Equifax.com ($7) because it gives you greater confidence that its high and low estimates are accurate by indicating the strength of your local market and by noting anomalies like a high number of foreclosures or house-flippings, where homes are bought with the idea of fixing them up and quickly reselling them.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homesmartreports plans to offer a service for home buyers, too, that would provide an unlimited number of reports over a 30-day or 90-day period so you can get a better idea of how much to offer for a house.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Get listed  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the new sales services try to sidestep the M.L.S. As listings proliferate openly on the Web, the M.L.S. may one day be less important. But for now, in all but the hottest markets, it pays to get into the M.L.S.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost every community has a discount broker who will charge $300 to $800 just to type the information about your house into the local M.L.S. (Some will also take pictures of the house to run with the listing.)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is one caveat: If you list there, you may be obligated to pay a commission to the buyer's agent, which is usually set at 3 percent. You can, however, build that commission into the price of the home, so the buyer actually pays it. Or, if the housing market is particularly hot in your area, you may be able to write into the contract that the buyer is responsible for paying his agent's commission.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hand off the annoying stuff  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many sellers, the hardest part is all the details: staging the home for showings, holding the showings and handling all the paperwork and the negotiations. Many discount brokers offer an a la carte menu of services, which can quickly add up to more than a set commission.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paperwork is not that hard to do if your discount broker gives you all the preprinted forms. (You can probably foist some of that work on the buyer's agent, who is really working for you anyway.) Alternatively, go with a sales service that for a higher fee of about 1 percent of the selling price will handle everything. But these services often don't include an M.L.S. listing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for stagings and showings, watch a few shows on the cable channel HGTV, like ''Sell This House,'' to learn how decluttering or putting on a fresh coat of paint will raise the value of your home.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHEN Alan Greenspan warned that the stock market was displaying signs of ''irrational exuberance,'' share prices collapsed -- four years later. Now the Federal Reserve chairman says he can glimpse similar frothiness in housing prices. Does that mean that investors who have benefited from sharp rallies in sectors tied to real estate, not to mention homeowners, will get a free pass for four years?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not likely. Critical differences between the housing bubble, if that's what the relentless rise in home prices is, and the 1990's bubble in technology stocks suggest a swifter reckoning this time around.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Internet was new then and hard to value. There was no ceiling on share prices as long as speculators were willing to part with their disposable income.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing, on the other hand, is a necessity with a tangible worth. There is a limit to how much people can and will pay for a place to live, and with measures of affordability far below historical norms, it is reasonable to think that the limit is not far off.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices have risen 53 percent nationwide in the last five years and, if anything, the trend is accelerating. In the four quarters through June, the increase was 13.4 percent, according to the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight. That is the largest four-quarter rise recorded by the agency since 1979.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The torrid run-up has helped push stocks in industries related to housing, like construction, to even greater advances. Dow Jones's index of home construction stocks has risen 54 percent in the last 12 months, and its broader index of real estate securities is up 26 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To avoid, or at least forestall, a reversal, housing demand must remain high and mortgage rates low, especially compared with the rate of economic growth (which also would have to stay healthy).  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is a tall order, and construction industry executives apparently are not willing to bet on it. Richard Bernstein, a strategist at Merrill Lynch, pointed out in a note to clients that construction company executives had been vigorously selling their shares in their businesses. Heavy insider selling is a red flag.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We think there is a strong contrary message,'' Mr. Bernstein said, because share sales at home builders are occurring ''at a record pace across nearly the entire industry.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We think this insider selling somewhat mimics that of the technology sector during the year surrounding the peak of the bubble,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A serious decline in real estate stocks may have been put off for a while, albeit at a terrible price. The Dow Jones construction index peaked in July and had fallen about 19 percent when Hurricane Katrina struck on Aug. 29. It has risen about 4 percent in the belief that demand for homes would rise and interest rate increases would moderate.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Prudent Speculator newsletter has raised its opinion of providers of manufactured housing, calling the sector ''a big beneficiary of Katrina'' and saying that ''it is obvious that the aftermath of Katrina will require many more housing resources.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other companies tied to the housing market that may have been given a new lease on life by Katrina are specialist mortgage lenders and diversified banks with extensive mortgage portfolios. Their stocks, too, ''rallied a little bit on a pickup in housing demand and expectations that the Fed will stop raising rates,'' said Doug Burtnick, manager of the Gartmore Global Financial Fund.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They've had a pretty decent rally,'' he said, citing Countrywide Financial, National City and one stock in his portfolio, Wells Fargo.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Rosenberg, a Merrill Lynch economist, is skeptical about the rallies in home prices and real estate stocks, as well as the ability of Katrina to keep them going appreciably longer. ''What's this got to do with the price of an apartment on Central Park West?'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If he and the home building executives are assessing the market correctly, investors will do well to sell into the Katrina-inspired rally and lock in gains. And anyone thinking of buying a house now may wish to think again.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The market is as vulnerable today as the last time we had this stretched affordability in 1989,'' Mr. Rosenberg said. ''It might not be on the same par as the equity bubble in the late 90's, but it's not far off.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TO look at them now, Warren and Kimlyn Preis appear to have hit the real estate jackpot. They paid $425,000 for their current house in Chicago in 1998, and today, Mr. Preis said, it is worth more than double that.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Preises also know what it is like to hit a losing streak: 15 years ago they were stuck paying two mortgages for more than a year after they bought a new apartment but could find no takers for their old one. When the old place finally sold, Mr. Preis said, he barely cleared a profit even though he had owned it for 12 years. Yet he is convinced that ''real estate is the cat's meow,'' and is looking to buy an investment property.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It will always work out because it will go through the bad cycle and return to the good cycle, and when it returns, it usually returns in a grand manner, as you see it now,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In markets where house prices have climbed the most, the boom of the last decade has created a lot of wealth, and with it a sense of collective amnesia. It afflicts not only those who bought in recent years and have never known anything but price increases, but also those who have been burned before.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Why do people go back to Vegas?'' asked Donna Olshan, a broker in Manhattan. ''They love to gamble. And people love real estate. They think that it isn't going to happen again and they go back in it.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as homeowners in several markets are trying to interpret mixed signals about whether prices and sales are peaking, the willful embrace of real estate persists as buyers overlook steep drops in prices in the early 1990's -- by as much as 22 percent in Los Angeles and nearly 47 percent in Manhattan.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some respects, it is not hard to understand why even those who lost money have largely expunged their memories of past stumbles: many have since recovered, and have amply made up for previous losses with recent gains. But back then, the downturn was severe. More than half of the people who bought co-ops and condos in Manhattan in 1986 or later and sold between 1990 and 1995 received less than what they paid for them, said Jonathan Miller, a real estate appraiser.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sellers in some areas of California felt similar pain. In 1994, when Ralph Houghton, a mortgage broker, took a new job near Denver, he and his wife tried to sell the three-bedroom house they had built in Running Springs, Calif., a small community east of Los Angeles near the San Bernadino Mountains, six years earlier. With no offers, they almost fell behind on their mortgage payments. After a year of letting the house stand vacant, Mr. Houghton cut his losses and transferred the house's deed to one of his wife's colleagues, who took over the mortgage payments.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite his experience in California, Mr. Houghton, who bought a house in a Denver suburb for $180,000, refinanced and added another $60,000 to his loan to cover renovations and the start-up costs of his own mortgage business. ''We're all human,'' he said. ''We need money.'' He said he is not worried because he figures the house is now worth about $350,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists are divided as to whether prices are poised to slide again. Inventories of homes for sale are building in places like San Diego, and last month, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said that ''home price increases will slow and prices could even decrease.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, economists are debating whether the Fed will raise or cut rates to deal with the increased oil prices and other short-term effects of the storm. If rates go down, that could prolong the housing boom, but if not, some economists say, the market is topping out.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For anxious homeowners wondering just how bad it could get if the bubble bursts this time, the lessons of the not-so-distant past can provide both caution and comfort.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much like in the last five years, homebuyers in the latter half of the 1980's got drunk on real estate. Bidding wars were common, and people rushed to close deals, convinced that prices were inexorably rising. But around 1990, as the defense industry contracted in Southern California and a recession hit the Northeast, real estate prices in those places started to tumble.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners who had been counting on appreciation to finance college educations or retirement saw their nest eggs wiped out. Desperate sellers offered to pay real estate agents commissions of 8 or even 10 percent. The proportion of mortgages in foreclosure more than doubled between 1990 and 1992 in California, Massachusetts and New York.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I couldn't sell anything to save my life,'' said Deanna Kory, a broker with the Corcoran Group in Manhattan, who said she went six months in 1990 without selling a single apartment.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some sellers simply pulled their homes off the market, but those who needed to divest because of a job relocation, a divorce or a new child often took a hit. In California, 26 percent of all homes sold between 1990 and 1995 went for less than the owners had originally paid, according to John Karevoll, an analyst at DataQuick Information Systems in San Diego.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Manhattan, David Dreyfuss got caught in the real estate downdraft when he and his wife, Lauren, tried to sell the one-bedroom prewar co-op that Mr. Dreyfuss had bought on East 57th Street for $210,000 in 1985. Expecting their first child in 1990, the couple put the apartment on the market for $300,000, but were offered nothing close to that price.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment sat on the market for more than a year. Mr. Dreyfuss recalled how difficult it was to keep the place in ''showroom condition'' with a small baby. It finally sold, in 1991, for $160,000. ''It was a vivid lesson of the cyclicality of the market,'' Mr. Dreyfuss said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The family moved to Rowayton, Conn., where they rented for a year and a half before buying a four-bedroom saltbox house in 1994. The cycle started to move in their favor when, three years later, they sold it for a hefty profit and upgraded to a four-bedroom house in Westport, adding a pool, another bedroom and an in-law suite. Today, Mr. Dreyfuss said, the house is worth 50 percent more than they have invested in it.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But his losses in 1991 have given him pause. Recently retired from the marketing company he founded, Mr. Dreyfuss, 51, said he had considered investing in houses for empty nesters. But he has decided against it. ''I think a couple of years from now we'll see that right about now is the top of the market,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Certainly, some homeowners lost money only on paper because they never sold when prices were low. ''Some of the funny money went away for a while,'' said Karl E. Case, an economist at Wellesley College. ''Even people who bought at the peak, by 1995 they were made whole and then some.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing bust was a godsend for some people, of course. In the late 1980's, Janice Brand was renting an apartment in the Beacon Hill neighborhood of Boston. ''I thought I was completely priced out of the market,'' she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in 1993, as prices fell, she found a two-bedroom apartment in the Charlestown neighborhood for less than $200,000. Seven years later, by then married, Ms. Brand and her husband, Robert Grady, were able to sell the place for nearly double what she paid and to trade up to a house on two acres on the North Shore of Massachusetts.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low-income buyers were also able to enter the market. Thomas Callahan, executive director of the Massachusetts Affordable Housing Alliance, said that when prices cooled between 1991 and 1996 in the Boston area, many people bought their first houses.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We sometimes call ourselves cheerleaders for the next real estate depression,'' Mr. Callahan said. ''Except we have thousands of successful homeowners who have purchased, so obviously a crash would hurt many of them.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Photos: BACK IN THE GAME -- Ralph and Janet Houghton lost money in 1994 on their house near Los Angeles, shown in a family snapshot, above, but they gambled again, buying a house near Denver, left, and borrowing to fix it up.; WINNERS -- A market slump in 1993 allowed Janice Brand to buy a Boston apartment, above, and, with Robert Grady, above center, to trade up in 2000 on the North Shore of Massachusetts.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SULLIVAN'S ISLAND, S.C. -- A SUDDEN rainstorm signals an early lunch hour, and beachgoers head off the expansive stretch of sand toward the center of town. The main drag, all three blocks of it, includes a Kangaroo Express gas station, a dentist's office, a day spa and a handful of restaurants including Bert's Bar, a local pub with the motto ''If it hurts, go to Bert's.'' Across the street, inside Poe's Tavern, known for its burgers and fish tacos, the scene is unhurried and casual, with shorts and T-shirts favored over button-down shirts and slacks.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlikely as it may seem, this is also the location of some of the most expensive second-home real estate in the country -- right up there with Aspen, Nantucket, Palm Beach and the Hamptons -- with a median home price last year of $1.1 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A varied collection of historic cottages and summer villas dot this unassuming barrier island off the coast of Charleston, from quaint beach bungalows with wide porches, latticework and dormer windows to several stately officers' quarters -- remnants of the island's long military history. There is also a growing number of McMansions that many locals refer to as boxes or cubes. Middle Street, once a trolley route, runs the length of the island. Residents cruise around in golf carts even though there is no golf course. The beach has no restrooms, lifeguards or parking lots.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thanks to the nation's unprecedented and currently much-debated real estate boom, houses in top vacation spots like Sullivan's Island have been fetching record prices. And those prices have been fueling a record number of sales. There were 2.82 million second-home sales last year -- 1.8 million were strictly investments, and just over a million were vacation homes. The total sales marked a 16 percent increase from the previous year, according to the National Association of Realtors. But there's surprisingly little information available on vacation home markets, mainly because second homes typically aren't differentiated in the public record from primary homes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To get a better sense of what's going on in the nation's priciest vacation markets, The New York Times asked Fidelity National Financial, a major real estate title insurer, to help identify high-end second-home markets across the nation. To locate spots with a significant number of these homes, the study used 2000 census data, organized by the Queens College sociology department, which noted ZIP codes where at least 10 percent of homes are used seasonally. Then Fidelity looked at public sales records of single-family homes, the most comprehensive data available, since it includes not just houses sold by brokers, but also sales by owners and transactions at new developments.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All together, the research examined 358 second-home markets with median single-family home prices of at least $300,000. The study also threw out any ZIP codes with fewer than 70 sales during the last year, eliminating some high-priced areas with just a handful of houses like Wainscott, N.Y., in the Hamptons, where just 16 homes sold last year. Finally, the data was sorted by state to identify the priciest markets in each one.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Top of the heap? Not surprisingly, it was Aspen, Colo., where the median home price through the end of 2004 was nearly $2.5 million. But even the most jaded real estate hound might be surprised by the fact that some ''fractionals'' (a fancy name for time shares) in Aspen are now going for $1 million for six weeks -- and that a teardown will cost you even more.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aspen wasn't the only well-known finisher. At the top of the most-expensive list are many familiar names: Newport Beach, Calif. (its quaint Balboa Island, to be specific); Palm Beach, Fla., known for its Gatsby-era architecture and highbrow shopping; Water Mill, N.Y., a standout even in the wealthy Hamptons on Long Island's famous East End. But sprinkled among them were some destinations that might be familiar to aficionados, but not to the wider public.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are places like Sullivan's Island; or Jamestown, R.I., a stone's throw from Newport; or Mantoloking, N.J., where about 525 homes sit on a sliver of land less than half a square mile between the Atlantic Ocean and Barnegat Bay. There are no restaurants or hotels in that town, just a fire department, police department and post office. And the local yacht club has a four-year waiting list to get in.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cathy Diehl, a mother of four from West Hartford, Conn., and her husband bought a four-bedroom house on Barnegat Bay in Mantoloking for about $1 million five years ago. ''We could probably get $3 million for it now,'' Ms. Diehl said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And she's probably right, though she's quick to add she has no plans to sell. Though price growth has slowed since 2003, when it was a stunning 41 percent, the median price of a house in Mantoloking still grew 34 percent through last year to $1.3 million. As the days of summer wound down in late August, the least expensive home for sale was a two-bedroom condominium across the street from a yacht club and two blocks from the beach. The asking price was $695,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHETHER well known or obscure, the top markets had a few things in common, beginning with size. Few of the Top 12 on the list are bigger than 15 square miles. That means homes are relatively scarce and the market has built-in limits, driving up prices. Then there's water. All but Aspen and Scottsdale, Ariz., were either on water or surrounded by it. And without exception they're a reasonable drive -- or helicopter flight -- from a major city.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of these places have seen enormous changes in a relatively short time. Just 30 years ago, Princeville, Hawaii, which came in as the ninth most expensive in the study, with a median home price of $715,000 in 2004, was a vast expanse of farmland set on a rolling, green bluff above Hanalei Bay on the north shore of Kauai. Now it's among the most exclusive planned developments on that island, with at least 1,500 condo units and almost 600 houses across 9,000 acres. There are also a luxury hotel, two acclaimed golf courses, tennis courts, a commuter airport and a shopping center, all of which have helped send the median home price skyrocketing 42 percent through the end of 2004.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have limited land and increased demand, and that drives prices,'' said Donna Apisa, president of Oceanfront Realty in Princeville.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jamestown, R.I., also had a history of farming before it became a summer retreat. Sitting at the mouth of Narragansett Bay and looking out the Atlantic Ocean, this 9.5-square-mile island has never been developed as a commercial area or a port. Dotted with historic sites and a few remaining farms, the island has a quiet, rural character with a mix of historic and modern buildings, parks and docks -- and a median home price of $558,750 for the first half of this year, up 36 percent from $410,000 for the same period last year, according to the Rhode Island Association of Realtors. Even so, brokers say, it's a relative bargain for Bostonians and New Yorkers who have been priced out of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While talk of a real estate bubble is rampant these days (''Mr. Housing Bubble'' T-shirts are being sold on the Internet), these top markets have continued to appreciate -- most saw double digit gains last year -- though in some places more slowly than in recent years. The median home price in Water Mill climbed 31 percent to nearly $1.6 million last year compared with the year before. Though that would still be considered a huge increase at nearly any other time and place, it's down from the 50 percent surge in 2003.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Have these markets peaked? Mike Sklarz, head of analytics at Fidelity, who conducted the study for The Times, doesn't think so. ''No one really knows when the market will peak,'' he said. The significant run-up in prices could mean a slowdown as towns get too pricey for all but a small segment of second-home buyers. But Mr. Sklarz said that a number of long-term underlying factors, including heightened interest in real estate investing and strong demand from baby boomers approaching retirement age ''tend to be quite positive.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, many of the buyers in these top markets aren't really buying weekend homes, which tend to be within driving distance of a primary residence. In Jamestown, people are ''not buying the traditional vacation home people would buy 10 or 20 years ago,'' said Paul Leys, co-owner of Gustave White Sotheby's International Realty in nearby Newport. ''They're buying their future principal residence.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard and Margaret Harris live in Dallas, but when they went shopping for a vacation home, it was an eight-hour plane ride away, in Princeville, where they were married seven years ago. In 2003 they bought their first place there, a two-bedroom condo. In June the couple bought a larger two-bedroom unit with a view of the bay and the mountains, which they plan to rent to vacationers for about $320 a night when they're not around. ''We really bought the first one more as investment,'' said Mr. Harris, who is 54. ''We're looking at the second one as some place where we could eventually retire.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If housing prices do stumble, as some economists predict they will as interest rates rise, those in vacation areas may be hard hit as discretionary spending slows. Investors may also pull out quickly as prospects for big returns start to dim. The most expensive destinations, however, may see less impact, since the wealthiest home buyers often are not deterred by rising interest rates or an economic downturn.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some real estate agents maintain that today's prices will hold. ''If there is a drop it will not be that large,'' said Michael Van Sciver, a broker at B&amp;K Real Estate in Mantoloking. ''There will always be people out there that want to be near the water.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's so far been the case on Sullivan's Island, the seventh most expensive market in the study. Sullivan's has long been popular with buyers from nearby Charleston, who flock to the beach each summer to escape the oppressive city heat. The island was hit hard by Hurricane Hugo in 1989. But the insurance money that followed the storm sparked a building boom, and many of the modest beach bungalows that weathered the storm have since fallen to the wrecking ball to make way for oversized McBeachhouses, some topping 8,000 square feet. Things had gotten so out of scale that earlier this year the Town Council limited new houses to 5,600 square feet. That's on top of rental restrictions that prevent owners from leasing their places out for less than four weeks at a time. Today, just 72 of the island's 850 homes can legally be leased short term.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those restrictions didn't bother Greg and Mary Beth Usry. Earlier this year, the couple, from Rye, N.Y., bought a four-bedroom vacation home on Sullivan's Island. ''It just felt more like a community more than a resort,'' Ms. Usry said. ''It has a very casual you-don't-have-to-get-dressed-up-to-go-to-dinner-like-in-the-Hamptons kind of feel.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some longtime residents worry the new popularity will ruin the island's serenity. ''I don't blame people for wanting to come here,'' said May Jones, 61, who has lived on the island for 30 years. But the influx of newcomers and sky-high prices are ''like killing the goose that laid the golden egg,'' she said. ''What made this paradise was it was a laid-back place to live.''  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN 2004, New York City approved building permits for 25,208 new housing units. That's up 17 percent from the city's average annual gain of 20,874 during the 1990's.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing boom may be a boon to many, but it has its drawbacks. Sure, it has been a blessing for owners who can afford property tax increases, cash out equity or refinance debt. It's created jobs and produced thousands of mostly expensive new houses, condominiums and apartments. And it has filled the coffers of city and state governments with billions of dollars.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In doing this, housing construction has performed its historic role as countercyclical ballast, helping the city and state to weather a recession and a recovery that has created minimal jobs in the economy's other industries.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the boom has also worsened the affordable housing crisis in New York City and across the state. It has burdened homeowners with rising assessments and property taxes -- putting elderly people on fixed incomes in particular difficulty. It has priced first-time buyers and young adults out of the market. It has burdened apartment dwellers with the rent increases that accompany rising taxes and operating costs. And, it has driven up the cost of land, leading to higher construction costs and making housing assistance all the more necessary.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Permits and production are opening numbers, but never the whole show. During the last decade, 34,071 new units were built in Manhattan, but there was a net increase in total housing units of only 13,017. Why the difference? Presumably, 21,054 units were demolished, vacated or converted to nonresidential use. Of Manhattan's 34,071 new units, 26,503 were occupied by renters, but the borough had a net gain of only 1,463 renter households. Once again, 25,040 units must have been demolished, vacated or converted to nonresidential use, co-ops, condominiums or other forms of owner-occupancy. Oddly, perhaps, in this context, were it not for construction of 14,158 rental apartments in buildings with federal low-income housing tax credits during the decade, Manhattan would have suffered a net loss of housing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the boroughs outside Manhattan, the opposite occurred. New construction produced 97,870 units, but the net increase from 1990 to 2000 was 195,726 because of rehabilitation and restoration of inventory. But only 10,088 apartments, or 5 percent, were in buildings with federal low-income housing tax credits.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amid all the construction, housing costs have risen much faster than New Yorkers' ability to pay them. Citywide, median household income rose 34 percent from 1989 to 2003, but the median monthly cost of owning a home with a mortgage rose 93 percent, the monthly fair-market rent for a two-bedroom apartment rose 74 percent and the median monthly gross rent for all apartments rose 64 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, 1.163 million New York City households, or 49 percent, had to spend 30 percent or more of their income on housing in 2003. That's up 33 percent, or 290,000 households, since 1990.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, where does this leave police recruits who join the force at the new collective bargaining agreement's starting salary, which is an annual rate of $25,100 for the first six months? If they can't find a friend or a spouse with a job to share housing costs, then, most likely, they're living either at home with their parents or some place 50 to 100 miles out in the Hudson Valley.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At $25,100, new police officers can afford no more than $625 a month if they are to use less than 30 percent of their income for housing, a cap commonly recommended by lenders and other financial advisers. So, they cannot afford the median cost of owning a home or the fair-market rent for a two-bedroom apartment in any of the city's boroughs or its suburban counties. They would have to use 51 percent of their income to pay the city's current $1,075 two-bedroom fair-market rent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor can new recruits afford the median rent, and thus half the apartments, in any of the city's boroughs as well as in Suffolk, Nassau, Westchester, Rockland, Putnam, Orange and Dutchess Counties. They would have to use more than 34 percent of their income to pay the median rent in the Bronx and more than 41 percent in Queens. Only by moving out 100 miles into rural Sullivan County and commuting almost two hours each way, would they be able to afford the median rent (about $575) and half the apartments there.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After six months and a bump in salary to $32,700, new officers can afford up to $818 a month, but their choices widen only a little. They will be able to manage the two-bedroom fair-market rents in rural Ulster ($735) and Sullivan ($666) Counties. And, they can afford the median rent in the Bronx ($719) and Brooklyn ($790) as well as in Ulster (about $630) and Sullivan (about $575) Counties.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having so few housing choices is a predicament shared by about 200,000 young adults in the boroughs outside Manhattan, 31,000 in the Hudson Valley and 100,000 on Long Island.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These 20- to 34-year-olds are prevented by high rents and low rental vacancy rates from leaving their parents' homes and forming their own household at a rate comparable to young adults living in other parts of New York State. Forty-nine percent of the young adults in the boroughs outside Manhattan are still living with their parents or other older adults, compared with a median of 35 percent in 34 counties in the state's major metropolitan areas and labor markets.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Assuming they would double up with a working spouse or triple up with working roommates to get a place of their own, these 200,000 young adults represent pent-up demand for between 67,000 to 100,000 affordable apartments. Their suburban counterparts represent potential demand for 44,000 to 66,000 more.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If they look for a place in the city, they will run up against, and worsen, the estimated 177,000-unit shortage of housing with rents below $800. If they look outside the city, they will increase the pressures on suburban residents who face their own affordable housing shortage. Conversely, if young adults from the suburbs look for places in the city, they will increase the pressures on the city's affordable inventory.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The affordable housing shortage transcends city limits just as it belies imprecise generalities about a housing bubble. Supply is so short, demand is so strong, and regional connections are so pervasive that substantial new production, like the city's 68,000-unit new development initiative, is both necessary and sustainable.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greater state and local protection for the rent-stabilization program and for Mitchell-Lama and other assisted and regulated developments, which together supply 80 percent of the city's apartments with rents below $800, is also critical.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, too, are stronger interventions to stem predatory lending and foreclosures among first-time home buyers, stronger local incentives and requirements for the inclusion of affordable units in new developments, regional smart-growth strategies to contain sprawl while creating sites for housing and conserving open space, increases in Albany's capital budget for affordable housing and more persistent pressure to defend and expand Washington's investment in affordable housing and community development.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In short, we need more constructive action and less bubble-blowing.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OUTSIDE the classroom at the American Real Estate School in Hauppauge recently, the final exam was over and students mingled in the hallway after having their exams graded on the spot.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The students had taken a 45-hour course in six days at the New York State-approved school. The class ended with a 100-question multiple-choice exam, a precursor to the state test required for a license to sell real estate.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was a tremendous amount to absorb and retain in six days,'' said Carol Szynaka, 40, of Southold on the North Fork, who said she had passed the school's exam.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Johanna Franco, 25, fluttered her eyelids when she told of her passing grade. A Brentwood resident, Ms. Franco came to the United States from Ecuador eight months ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She has a master's degree in journalism from a university in Ecuador, she said, but is still struggling to learn English at Suffolk County Community College. ''I don't understand what the teacher says,'' Ms. Franco said of the English-speaking real estate course instructor. ''Nothing, nothing, nothing.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, with her Spanish-English dictionary in hand to translate the textbook chapters every night, she said, she was able to pass the exam.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She had already registered to take the state licensing exam a week later and said she had a job lined up in an agency in Islip that serves a large Latin clientele.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The others outside the classroom included a 57-year-old former builder from Southampton aiming to renew his expired real estate license; a 29-year-old graphic designer with $17,000 in school loans that he hopes to pay off with help from real estate commissions; and a former medical student from Poland who now works in a florist shop.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everyone, it seems, wants to be a real estate agent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July, the New York Department of State ended walk-in registration at many testing sites, including the one near the school in Hauppauge, where some test takers arrived three hours early to get a good place in line.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Membership in the Long Island Board of Realtors, the local chapter of the National Association of Realtors, has risen nearly 40 percent since 2002, to 24,200 members.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's pretty much quick and easy,'' said Gerry Edelman, the president of the American Real Estate School. ''That's why so many people are choosing to do this.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For just that reason, the State Association of Realtors, a real estate lobbying group, has recommended to the State Legislature that prospective real estate agents learn more before the state gives them licenses.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The State Assembly passed a bill in May requiring 45 additional hours of course instruction and passing another written exam to renew a real estate sales license after two years. A similar bill was introduced in the State Senate but has not been voted upon.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to a memo attached to the Assembly bill, there are 39 states with more stringent education requirements than New York.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Assembly bill also requires that a real estate agent identification card have a photograph, ''to help consumers confirm that they are working with bona fide licensed real estate professionals.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For brokers, those who can run a real estate office, the bill would raise licensing requirements to 135 course hours from 90 and two years' experience under a broker's supervision (only one year is required now).  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are 21 approved real estate schools across Long Island. Many of them, like the American Real Estate School, teach the course in several locations. Some high schools and colleges are also on the state-approved list, including Syosset High School, Uniondale High School and Suffolk and Nassau Community Colleges.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While course textbooks do not require state approval, the Department of State outlines the curriculum and sends real estate law updates to approved schools to be included in their courses.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Subjects covered in the current real estate sales agent curriculum include fair housing, land use restrictions, real estate law and mortgage financing. But the curriculum was last revised five years ago, according to the Department of State.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With median home prices on Long Island now above $400,000, many say an overhaul is overdue.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's the biggest purchase that the average consumer will make,'' said Mary Anne Monteleone, the vice president of professional development at the Long Island Board of Realtors. ''It's time to look at the course content and the complexities of New York real estate and see if the course curriculum correctly reflects New York market conditions.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With growing numbers of people trying to hop on the real-estate bandwagon, some real estate brokers say there has been a decline in the quality of sales agents.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The caliber of most of the recruits out there is very disappointing,'' said Bonnie Doran, a vice president at Daniel Gale Real Estate. ''Almost anybody can take this test and become a real estate agent.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daniel Gale, one of the larger firms on Long Island, has its own training and mentoring program for new agents, Ms. Doran said. She handles recruiting for the firm.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real estate business has changed since the days, 30 years ago, when ''you went out and showed some houses, then the first one who made the offer at full price got the house; you put the two together, the attorneys took over and that was that,'' she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In today's frenzied market, it is much more common to encounter offers over the full price and bidding wars that rage even after an offer has been tentatively accepted. ''It's much more complicated today,'' Ms. Doran said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, disclosure laws require real estate agents to tell buyers that they are representing sellers. The seller must sign forms stating that there is no known lead paint in the home. In addition, ''major firms all have some kind of interaction with title, insurance or mortgage companies,'' Ms. Doran said. ''This must be disclosed.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some areas, like the East End of Long Island, building restrictions on waterfront properties are defined by state and federal laws.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While ''caveat emptor'' still applies to home buyers, familiarity with these laws and local zoning codes can help sellers and buyers, according to Lawrence Porter, a managing partner at Brown Harris Stevens and president of the Hamptons and North Fork Realtors Association.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate agents and their clients would benefit from additional education, he said, ''as long as they're willing to tailor the 45 hours of education to areas where they'll be working.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Szynaka, the prospective sales agent from Southold, thinks additional education can only help, ''but I don't think anything replaces real-life experience.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taking 45 hours of classes and passing a test are a way to get started, but the greater test lies ahead.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You'll know if you're cut out for it,'' she said, ''by whether you can make a living at it.''  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE median value of single-family homes in Westchester skyrocketed 78 percent between 1990 and 2003 to $502,882 from $282,200, the fifth-highest among more than 200 counties nationwide, according to census data. The median value soared in Dutchess County too, up 60 percent to $238,258 from $149,200. Simultaneously, the population aged 20 to 34 in Westchester and Dutchess fell 18 percent and 20.5 percent, respectively, during the last decade -- that's nearly four times the national decline.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What does one have to do with the other? The housing boom may be a boon to many, but it's a bane to young people. Sure, it has been a blessing for owners who can afford property tax increases, cash out equity or refinance debt. It's created jobs and produced thousands of mostly expensive new houses, condominiums and apartments, and it has filled the coffers of state and local governments with billions of dollars.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In doing this, housing construction has performed its historic role as countercyclical ballast, helping communities and the state to weather a recession and a recovery that has created minimal jobs in the economy's other industries.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the boom has also worsened the affordable housing crisis in Westchester and Dutchess. It has burdened homeowners with rising assessments and property taxes -- putting elderly people on fixed incomes in particular difficulty. It has burdened apartment dwellers with the rent increases that accompany rising taxes and operating costs. It has driven up the cost of land, leading to higher construction costs and making housing assistance all the more necessary. And most ominously for the future of the region, it has priced first-time buyers and young adults out of the market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the last decade, 18,934 new housing units were built in Westchester. They included 6,037 rentals. But, only 1,363 apartments -- 7 percent of the total construction -- were in buildings with federal low-income housing tax credits.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Dutchess, 10,216 new units were built and an additional 1,490 were rehabilitated or converted from nonresidential use. Together, they included 3,235 rentals. A mere 238 apartments, just 2 percent of the 11,706 total, were in buildings with federal low-income housing tax credits.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amid all the construction, housing costs have risen much faster than residents' ability to pay them. Westchester's median household income rose 38 percent from 1989 to 2003, but the median monthly cost of owning a home with a mortgage rose 63 percent, the monthly fair-market rent for a two-bedroom apartment rose 76 percent and the median monthly gross rent for all apartments rose 56 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Likewise, Dutchess's median household income rose 29 percent, but the median monthly cost of owning a home with a mortgage rose 55 percent; the median monthly expense for property taxes, insurance and utilities rose 43 percent; the monthly fair-market rent for a two-bedroom apartment rose 52 percent; and the median monthly gross rent for all apartments rose 40 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, 1 out of 3 households in Westchester and Dutchess -- 98,043 in Westchester and 30,350 (33 percent) in Dutchess -- had to spend 30 percent or more of their income for housing in 2003. That's up 13 percent in Westchester and a whopping 42 percent in Dutchess since 1990.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, where does this leave young adults starting work at salaries of, say, $25,100 a year, like computer operators, hospital technicians or even New York City's new police recruits? If they can't find a friend or a spouse with a job to share housing costs, then, most likely, they're living further out in the Hudson Valley or still at home with their parents.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At $25,100, young workers can afford no more than $625 a month if they are to use less than 30 percent of their income for housing, a cap commonly recommended by lenders and other financial advisers. So, they cannot afford the median cost of owning a home or the fair-market rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Westchester, Dutchess, Rockland, Putnam, Orange, Ulster or Sullivan, not to mention Long Island and New York City. They would have to use 60 percent of their income to pay Westchester's current $1,259 two-bedroom fair-market rent and 45 percent to pay Dutchess's $942.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor can these workers afford the median rent, and thus half the apartments, in Westchester, Dutchess, Rockland, Putnam, Orange, Nassau and Suffolk Counties or in any of the city's boroughs. They would have to use 37 percent of their income to pay the median rent in Dutchess and 45 percent in Westchester.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only by moving to rural Sullivan County would they be able to afford the median rent (about $576). For those moving to, say, Monticello and working in White Plains that could mean an 80-mile, 90-minute commute each way.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with a bump in salary to $32,700, so they can afford up to $818 a month, their choices widen only a little. They will be able to manage the two-bedroom fair-market rents in rural Ulster ($735) and Sullivan ($666) Counties. And, they can afford the median rent in Ulster (about $630) and Sullivan (about $575) plus the Bronx ($719) and Brooklyn ($790).  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having so few housing choices is a predicament shared by about 17,700 young adults in Westchester and 1,200 young adults in Dutchess as well as 12,100 more in Rockland, Putnam, Orange, Ulster and Sullivan, an additional 100,000 on Long Island, and 200,000 more in the boroughs outside Manhattan.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These 20- to 34-year-olds are prevented by high rents and low rental vacancy rates from leaving their parents' homes and forming their own household at a rate comparable to young adults living in other parts of New York State. Forty-six percent of Westchester's young adults and 38 percent of Dutchess's are still living with their parents or other older adults, compared to a median of 35 percent in 34 counties in the state's major metropolitan areas and labor markets.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Assuming they would double up with a working spouse or triple up with working roommates to get a place of their own, Westchester's 17,700 young adults represent pent-up demand for 5,900 to 8,800 affordable apartments. Dutchess's 1,200 young adults represent potential demand for 400 to 600. Their counterparts in the Hudson Valley's other counties, in the boroughs outside Manhattan and on Long Island indicate a potential market for 104,000 to 154,000 more.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If they look for a place close to home, Westchester's young adults will run up against, and worsen, the shortage of affordable housing that afflicts the 98,000 households there who cannot afford the county's median rent. This shortage has been estimated at 15,400 units with rents below $900.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dutchess's young adults will also confront, and aggravate, the shortage facing the 26,400 existing households there who cannot afford the county's median rent. This shortage approaches 5,400 units with rents below $760.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If they look toward the city, Long Island or the other Hudson Valley counties, they will increase the pressures on households who face their own shortfalls in affordable housing. These have been estimated to be as high as 177,000 units in the city, 80,000 on Long Island, and 23,000 in Putnam, Rockland, Orange, Ulster and Sullivan.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The affordable housing shortage transcends local boundaries just as it belies imprecise generalities about a housing bubble. Supply is so short, demand is so strong, and regional connections are so pervasive that substantial new production, like New York City's 68,000-unit new development initiative, is both necessary and sustainable.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stronger state and local incentives and requirements for the inclusion of affordable units in new developments as well as regional smart-growth strategies to contain sprawl while creating sites for new housing and conserving open space are critical.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, too, are stronger state and local protection for apartments in assisted and regulated buildings, more aggressive intervention to stem predatory lending and foreclosures among first-time home buyers, increases in Albany's capital budget for affordable housing and more persistent pressure to defend and expand Washington's investment in affordable housing and community development.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In short, we need more constructive action and less bubble-blowing.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE median value of Long Island's single-family homes skyrocketed between 1990 and 2003, doubling in Suffolk County to $333,251 from $165,200 and rising 81 percent in Nassau to $378,152 from $208,500, according to census data. Simultaneously, Long Island's population of people aged 20 to 34 fell 20 percent. There were 127,401 fewer young adults on the island in 2000 than in 1990. (Meanwhile, that population declined only 5 percent in the nation as a whole.)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What does one have to do with the other? The housing boom may be a boon to many, but it's been a bane to young people. Sure, it has been a blessing for owners who can afford property tax increases, cash out equity or refinance debt. It's created jobs and produced thousands of mostly expensive new houses, condominiums and apartments, and it has filled the coffers of state and local governments with billions of dollars.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In doing this, housing construction has performed its historic role as countercyclical ballast, helping communities and the state to weather a recession and a recovery that has created minimal jobs in the economy's other industries.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the boom has also worsened Long Island's affordable housing crisis. It has burdened homeowners with rising assessments and property taxes -- putting elderly people on fixed incomes in particular difficulty. It has burdened apartment dwellers with the rent increases that accompany rising taxes and operating costs. It has driven up the cost of land, leading to higher construction costs and making housing assistance all the more necessary. And most ominously for the future of Long Island, it has priced first-time buyers and young adults out of the market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the last decade, 62,313 housing units were built on Long Island, more than 12,000 in Nassau and just shy of 50,000 in Suffolk. An additional 6,634 units were rehabilitated or converted from nonresidential use.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the total 68,947 new and added units, 14,334 were rentals. But only 1,472 -- a paltry 2 percent -- were in buildings with federal low-income housing tax credits. Nassau had 376 and Suffolk had 1,096.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amid all the construction, housing costs have risen much faster than Long Islanders' ability to pay them. Nassau's median household income rose 49 percent from 1989 to 2003, but the median monthly cost of owning a home with a mortgage rose 78 percent; the median monthly expense for property taxes, insurance and utilities rose 109 percent; the monthly fair-market rent for a two-bedroom apartment rose 62 percent; and the median monthly gross rent for apartments rose 62 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Likewise, Suffolk's median household income rose 43 percent, but the median monthly cost of owning a home with a mortgage rose 72 percent; the median monthly expense for property taxes, insurance and utilities rose 86 percent; the monthly fair-market rent for a two-bedroom apartment rose 62 percent; and the median monthly gross rent for apartments rose 41 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, 4 out of 10 Long Island households, or 333,279, had to spend 30 percent or more of their income on housing in 2003. That's up 28 percent, or 73,530 households, since 1990.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, where does this leave young adults starting work at salaries of, say, $25,100 a year, like secretaries, hospital technicians or even New York City's new police recruits? If they can't find a friend or a spouse with a job to share housing costs, then, most likely, they're living off the island or still at home with their parents.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At $25,100, young workers can afford no more than $625 a month if they are to use less than 30 percent of their income for housing, a cap commonly recommended by lenders and other financial advisers. So they cannot afford the median cost of owning a home or the fair-market rent for a two-bedroom apartment on Long Island, in the city or in the nearby Hudson Valley. They would have to use 59 percent of their income to pay the island's current $1,225 two-bedroom fair-market rent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor can these workers afford the median rent, and thus half the apartments, on Long Island, in any New York City borough, or in Westchester, Rockland, Putnam, Orange and Dutchess Counties. They would have to use 42 percent of their incomes to pay the median rent in Queens, 38 percent in Brooklyn. Only by moving out 130 miles into rural Sullivan County and commuting more than two hours each way, would they be able to afford the median rent (about $575) and half the apartments there.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with a bump in salary to $32,700 so they can afford up to $818 a month, their choices widen only a little. They will be able to manage the two-bedroom fair-market rents in rural Ulster ($735) and Sullivan ($666) Counties. And, they can afford the median rent in the Bronx ($719) and Brooklyn ($790), as well as in Ulster (about $630) and Sullivan (about $575) Counties.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having so few housing choices is a predicament shared by about 100,000 Long Island young adults together with 200,000 more in the boroughs outside Manhattan and an additional 31,000 in the Hudson Valley.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These 20- to 34-year-olds are prevented by high rents and low rental vacancy rates from leaving their parents' homes and forming their own household at a rate comparable to young adults living in other parts of New York State. Fifty-nine percent of Nassau's young adults and 52 percent of Suffolk's are still living with their parents or other older adults, compared to a median of 35 percent in 34 counties in the state's major metropolitan areas and labor markets.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Assuming they would double up with a working spouse or triple up with working roommates to get a place of their own, Long Island's 100,000 young adults represent pent-up demand for 33,000 to 50,000 affordable apartments. Their counterparts in the Hudson Valley and the boroughs outside Manhattan represent potential demand for 77,000 to 115,000 more.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If they look for a place close to home, Long Island's young adults will run up against, and worsen, the nearly 80,000-unit shortage of housing with rents below $1,000. If they look to the city or its northern suburbs, they will increase the pressures on the households there who face their own shortfalls in affordable housing. These have been estimated to be as high as 177,000 units in the city and 44,000 in the Hudson Valley.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The affordable housing shortage transcends local boundaries just as it belies imprecise generalities about a housing bubble. Supply is so short, demand is so strong, and regional connections are so pervasive that substantial new production, like New York City's 68,000-unit new development initiative, is both necessary and sustainable.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IF housing prices fall, will mortgages cushion the decline, or make it worse? Put another way, will more overstretched homeowners be forced to sell?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At issue is whether financial innovations that have made it easier for Americans to buy homes have also made the system less stable and more subject to shocks that could drive many from their homes.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traditionally, home mortgages, unlike loans to buy stock, have had a calming influence during tough times. If you buy stock with borrowed money, a decline in prices can bring on margin calls, and you must either put up cash or sell.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But homeowners have been able to hold on because mortgage loans -- unlike margin loans on stocks -- do not become due just because the value of the property declines. Your mortgage will not be foreclosed so long as you meet the monthly payments, even if the house is now worth less than you owe.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the old days, the mortgage in question was probably a 30-year fixed-rate loan, and the monthly payment stayed the same for the life of the mortgage. Someone who lost a job might be unable to make the payments, but most homeowners could keep doing so.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, however, mortgages that were unknown in years past have become common in some areas. They feature variable interest rates that can leap if market rates do, and some allow payments of only the interest owed, or even less, for several years. Such loans made it possible for people to buy houses they otherwise could not afford, and helped to propel the housing boom that continued through the 2001-2 recession even as the stock market plunged.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But those mortgages are designed to allow monthly payments to rise rapidly. Rising interest rates, or the end of five-year teaser periods, can cause such increases, which would leave some homeowners unable to meet the payments. They expect to refinance, but that is impossible if the house is not worth the amount owed. The result could be forced sales into a weak market.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, all the talk about bubbles may be just talk. In the late 1990's stock market, those who warned that prices were too high were discredited by the final huge rise in 1999 and early 2000. Only after most bears were silenced did they become right.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE housing bears now are anything but silent, and there is little sign of the economic news -- soaring interest rates or recession or both -- that would bring down home prices.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if and when a fall comes, watch the volume of home sales, particularly of existing homes. In the early 1980's recession, annual sales of existing homes fell 50 percent, to two million homes.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week there was talk of a weakening housing market because sales of existing homes seemed to slip in July. But that was more a matter of seasonal adjustments than reality. Over the last 12 months, 6.1 million single-family homes were sold along with nearly 1.3 million new homes. Both figures are records.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing is, of course, a collection of regional markets, with widely varying prices. The most expensive areas, and the ones that have risen the most in the last five years, are concentrated on the coasts, and are presumably the most vulnerable if prices do start to fall.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When that does happen, watch the volume of sales of existing homes. If it falls rapidly, that will be an indication that not much has changed, and the damage is likely to be limited.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if sales volume stays high, that could indicate that the mortgage innovations are hurting. Then we could see rising numbers of foreclosures as homeowners discover they cannot sell their homes for what they owe but also cannot pay their suddenly higher monthly mortgage bills.   </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nation's long housing boom appears to be losing steam.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes fell more than expected in July and prices were virtually flat compared with the previous month, the National Association of Realtors reported yesterday. Perhaps most significant, the price of condominiums, which have recently attracted a growing number of speculators looking to cash in on the boom, fell for the second straight month, while the number of condos on the market rose sharply.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We could very much be close to the peak at this time,'' said Lynn Reaser, chief economist at Bank of America's capital markets group.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are signs that investors are becoming a little more cautious about the housing market,'' she added. ''Sellers of the higher-price homes are not getting their asking prices, and there is a buildup of inventories.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists pointed out that house sales remained near record highs and that the slowdown might turn out to be more of a blip than a clear signal that the boom was reaching a peak. The agents' association adjusts its numbers to take into account seasonal variations like summer vacations; the adjustments are only an estimate, however, and the picture will not become clearer until more data is available, analysts said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the unexpectedly weak report -- especially the softening of the condominium market -- caught investors off guard and helped push down stock prices early in the day. The market recovered later, but the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index closed with a slight loss, falling 0.34 percent, to 1217.59.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The overall number of homes sold last month fell 2.6 percent, to an annual rate of 7.16 million; economists had expected existing-home sales to reach an annual pace of 7.25 million in July. The median price of condos and co-ops fell 1.1 percent, to $219,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not just that the sales level was down but look at the difference between single-family and condos,'' said Ken Mayland, president of ClearView Economics based in Ohio. Single-family home sales fell 2.3 percent while condo and co-op sales fell 5 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with July 2004, overall sales were still up 4.7 percent last month. The median sales price -- the price at which half the homes sold for more and half sold for less -- rose only slightly from June but was up 14.1 percent from a year ago, to $218,0000, according to the real estate agents.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's still a sellers' market, although I don't know that we are seeing as many multiple offers and huge increase in the list price,'' said Thomas R. Kunz, president and chief executive of Century 21, the real estate brokerage company.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were enough condos for sale -- about 404,000 units -- to keep the market supplied for 5.3 months, up from 329,000 units and 4.1 months in June and 3.5 months in July 2004.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall inventories rose 2.6 percent, to 2.75 million homes, in July, a 4.6-month supply of homes. That is the greatest supply since 2003, but still well below historic levels of six months, real estate executives said. The single-family house inventory of 4.5 months was little changed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To Mr. Kunz of Century 21, the slowdown in sales was a welcome development, he said, because the market had reached unsustainable highs in some states like California.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Often the fastest-growing region in recent years, the West last month experienced the biggest drop in number of homes sold -- 7.5 percent -- and prices in the region were flat. That appears to confirm reports from real estate agents there that growth was beginning to slow.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kunz said sales were coming off a peak in some California markets, but that other areas in the region, like Phoenix and its suburbs, were still strong. ''California just controls such a huge part of the market that it overshadows everybody else,'' said Mr. Kunz, who recently moved to New Jersey from Southern California.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in California, local experts say the market remains robust, with prices up 16 percent from a year ago. That's down from average increases of 18 percent in 2003 and 24 percent in 2004, but faster than the rest of the nation, said Michael Carney, a professor at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona and director of the Real Estate Research Center.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are lots of people who are trying to find signs of cooling,'' Professor Carney said. ''I don't see it at this time.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The South was the only one of four regions not to register a decline in sales, but prices there fell 1 percent. Sales of existing homes dipped 3.3 percent in the Northeast, and median prices edged up slightly. The Midwest had a 1.8 percent dip in sales and a 2.3 percent rise in prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates rose slightly in July, but were still below their levels of a year ago. According to Freddie Mac, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate in June was 5.7 percent, up from 5.58 percent in June but less than the 6.06 percent level in July 2004.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE world's online betting markets have done quite a nice job of predicting the future lately.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A kind of futures exchange where participants bet on real- world events, these markets could have told somebody last fall to ignore the talk of a late surge by John Kerry and stick with President Bush. Based on the odds posted at InTrade, one of the biggest exchanges, you could have correctly forecast the presidential winner of all 50 states, and 33 of 34 Senate races.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The markets also could have told you that Cardinal Josef Ratzinger was neither too old nor too doctrinaire for his red-hatted colleagues. His contract was the most expensive on InTrade in the days before he was chosen to succeed John Paul II, meaning that it had the smallest payoff, because traders considered the cardinal the favorite.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this country's version of a conclave, Carrie Underwood was correctly anticipated as the next ''American Idol'' winner. About 85 percent of recent Emmy winners have been identified by the odds. Even Saddam Hussein's capture was not beyond their powers of prescience. In the days before American soldiers pulled him out of his hole in 2003, the price of a contract tied to his capture more than tripled in price.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now one of these markets has turned its gaze to a consumer activity that is a favorite discussion topic these days: real estate. And the bettors see no signs of a bursting bubble anytime soon.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">San Diego? Prices will rise another 5 percent in the third quarter, according to the bettors at HedgeStreet, another Web site. New York? They will inch up 2 percent. In Los Angeles, they will jump 7 percent. In each of the cities, as in San Francisco, prices will be more than 10 percent higher than they had been a year earlier.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Internet has allowed these betting markets to flourish, and their predictive power stems from what the writer James Surowiecki calls ''The Wisdom of Crowds,'' in his recent book of that name. When people take the time to study something and then put their money where their mind is, their cumulative intelligence can be cunning. As long as there are enough prognosticators, they gather their evidence independently and their backgrounds are diverse, they often do better than individual experts who have spent years studying the subject.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HedgeStreet began accepting bets this year on house values in a handful of major cities. In the weeks leading up to the release of new numbers from the National Association of Realtors, bettors can buy contracts that make a payout according to a metropolitan area's average price.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The higher that average ends up being, the more that the contract pays. So the contract's price tells you what investors, as a group, expect to happen. When the San Diego contract rises in value, it's because traders think the upcoming house prices will be high and the contract's payout handsome.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With real estate brokers in some cities reporting that home sales have recently slowed, it might be tempting to dismiss HedgeStreet's bullishness as yet another signal that the nation's love affair with real estate has become a dangerous obsession. Many economists -- including Richard J. DeKaser, chief economist at National City, a large mortgage lender, who has compared home values to population and income in every large metropolitan area -- insist that many home prices are irrationally high.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even Russell Andersson, a co-founder of HedgeStreet, which is based in San Mateo, Calif., calls the current betting market a reflection of housing euphoria. ''Personally, I think we are cresting,'' Mr. Andersson said. ''I think the market may be more likely to go down by 20 percent than go up by 20 percent.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the recent track record of the betting markets has earned them some deference, and the real estate traders certainly have a coherent argument on their side. Mortgage rates remain low. The economy continues to grow. The nation's biggest cities are much nicer places than they were a generation ago. The sales slowdown reported by brokers looks similar to other recent pauses that proved ephemeral. Even if it busts at some point, the housing market may have some boom left in it.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The founders of HedgeStreet envision it ultimately as more than a playground for aspiring prophets. If it grew large enough and added contracts with a longer horizon than a quarter, it could allow people to insure themselves against some of life's economic risks.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Somebody who drives 100 miles a day could buy gas price contracts, which HedgeStreet also sells, to hedge exposure to rising oil prices. A family that had all its wealth tied up in the California real estate market could do likewise with local housing prices. As any good financial adviser will preach, diversification is crucial to smart investing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But using the betting markets as an insurance policy will make sense only when they attract enough investors to meet all of the requirements for a truly wise crowd: size, independence and diversity. HedgeStreet housing contracts now trade only a few thousand times each quarter. The crowd is big enough to make its forecasts interesting but small enough to elicit some skepticism from the rest of us.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At InTrade, the most accurate odds have been the ones based on the largest volume of trades, said Michael Knesevitch, the company's director of communications. The political contracts exchanged hands a few million times before last year's election, for example.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the volume dips into the thousands, the markets sometimes produce a Ratzinger and other times an Edith Brown Clement, the federal appeals judge who bettors wrongly thought would be Mr. Bush's Supreme Court nominee. Still, the markets often do a better job than many of the experts who appear in the news media.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking ahead, the markets think Ben S. Bernanke or Lawrence B. Lindsay will succeed Alan Greenspan as Federal Reserve chairman. Hillary Rodham Clinton or Mark R. Warner, the governor of Virginia, will be running in the 2008 presidential election against Senator John McCain of Arizona or Senator George Allen of Virginia. ''Desperate Housewives'' will win the Emmy next month for best comedy. If you believe the traders, you will not want to sell any real estate between now and then.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By VIKAS BAJAJ  </div><div>1072 words</div><div>17 August 2005</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2005 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Record oil prices are beginning to slow the economy, according to several reports released yesterday, but expansion continued in July because of the housing market and demand from businesses and consumers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reports said inflation grew faster than expected, industrial production slowed in July and home construction took a slight breather. But the consumer generally remained resilient.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Outside of energy, the consumer is fine,'' said Anthony Chan, a senior economist at JPMorgan Asset Management. ''That's why growth this year will be weaker than last year, and it will be weaker next year than this year.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though economists do not expect higher energy costs to derail the current expansion, some, like Mr. Chan, argue that rising interest rates and oil prices will slow growth from the 4.2 percent pace it set in 2004, which was the fastest since 1999.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Consumer Price Index increased 0.5 percent in July after being unchanged in June and falling 0.1 percent in May, the Labor Department reported. Excluding food and energy prices, the core inflation rate was up 0.1 percent in July, the same percentage increase as in June. Economists were expecting an overall increase of 0.4 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with July 2004, consumer prices were up 3.2 percent and the core rate was up 2.1 percent. In the New York area, prices rose 0.9 percent from June and 3.4 percent from July 2004.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other economic reports released yesterday showed that new-home construction dipped 0.1 percent in July and that industrial production grew 0.1 percent in the month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said both numbers were poised to increase because construction permits were still rising and manufacturers had depleted inventories.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Energy prices climbed 3.8 percent, with petroleum-based products up 6.1 percent. Food prices were up 0.2 percent in July from June. Excluding energy, consumer prices were up 0.2 percent in the month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising energy has the greatest impact on average American workers -- those in nonsupervisory or production occupations. For that group, which makes up 80 percent of America's private labor force, real average weekly wages, which take into account inflation, fell 0.2 percent in July, according to a Labor Department report released yesterday. Wages rose 0.4 percent before taking into account the effect of rising prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price decreases in many industries appear to be offsetting some of the increases in energy costs, however. New car prices, for instance, fell 1 percent in July, the second month in which domestic automakers offered low employee prices to all buyers. Apparel prices, which have decreased or stayed flat for six of the last seven months, fell 0.9 in July.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those price reductions, some of which are driven by competition and others by companies hoping to remedy slow sales, have helped increase retail sales and keep consumers shopping. Retail sales were up 1.8 percent in July and 1.7 percent in June.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Obviously, at some point it becomes the case of the price effect outweighing the ability to spend more, but we haven't gotten to the point yet,'' said David J. Greenlaw, an economist at Morgan Stanley.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market is an example of a market not buckling under rising prices.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts, which measure the beginning of new construction, fell 0.1 percent in July, to 2.04 million, but were still 2.8 percent higher than a year ago, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. Permits for new residential construction, an indicator of future activity, were up 1.6 percent, to 2.17 million, compared with June and up 2.5 percent compared with a year ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With these permit numbers and the record home sales in June, there is plenty of momentum,'' said Timothy E. Rogers, chief economist at Briefing.com. He said that although there was some talk that the housing sector was starting to slow ''I will believe that when I see it.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some parts of the country, particularly in the West, an area with some of the nation's hottest housing markets, home sales do appear to be slowing and prices seem to be leveling off after big increases in the last few years, according to regional statistics and real estate agents.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You do see some evidence of a little bit slowing in the West and some expanding activity in the South,'' Mr. Greenlaw said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists expect home sales and construction activity to stay at current high levels until mortgage rates, which remain at historically low rates, rise by 0.5 percentage points or more. The average 30-year fixed-mortgage rate was 5.89 for the week ending Aug. 11, according to Freddie Mac. That was up slightly from 5.82 percent the week before and 5.85 percent a year earlier.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve, meanwhile, reported that industrial production rose 0.1 percent in July, less than the 0.5 percent economists were expecting. Most of the shortfall was caused by automakers reducing output by 2.3 percent in the month as they tried to clear lots filled with unsold trucks and sport utility vehicles. Excluding autos, production rose 0.4 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hurricanes and tropical storms hurt oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico, driving down mining output 1.3 percent in July. But production rose in computer and electronic equipment (up 2.3 percent) and at utilities (0.7 percent).  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists, who were expecting production to be up 0.5 percent over all, said they still expected industrial output to climb in the second half of the year because consumer demand remained strong and manufacturers and retailers were staring at largely empty warehouses.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have seen very clear evidence that capital investment is rebuilding very rapidly,'' Mr. Rogers said.  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">United States home prices surged 13.6 percent in the second quarter, the fastest pace in more than a quarter of a century, as a decline in interest rates fueled record sales.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of an existing single-family home rose to $208,500 from $183,500 a year earlier, the National Association of Realtors said in a report released yesterday. It was the biggest jump since a 15.3 percent gain in the third quarter of 1979. Sales of existing houses and condominiums gained 4.6 percent to an annualized pace of 7.22 million units, the highest ever.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The continuing shortages of housing inventory are driving the price gains,'' David Lereah, the group's chief economist, said in the report. ''There is no evidence of bubbles popping.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices and sales will probably cool next year, the group said in a forecast on Aug. 9. Prices of existing homes are likely to rise 5.2 percent in 2006 while sales will probably drop 3.6 percent. Sales currently are ''close to a peak,'' Mr. Lereah said in the forecast.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A gauge of home builder optimism fell to 67 in August from 70 in July, the second consecutive decline, according to a report issued yesterday by the National Association of Home Builders in Washington. The group cited concern about high land costs and a shortage of lots for building.  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price for a house in Suffolk County reached a record $400,000 in July, according to a monthly activity report from the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island, a network of some 2,500 real estate offices on Long Island and in Queens that tracks real estate sales and inventory.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Suffolk median was 3.9 percent higher than the June median price, $385,000. Nassau County's median price was $490,000 in July, a 4.25 percent increase over the June median of $470,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June, 22 percent more houses were on the market than during the same month last year, the listing service reported. That, along with a slower rate of increase in house prices, may indicate that prices may have outpaced what most buyers can afford.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pearl Kamer, the chief economist for the Long Island Association, said that the price of a house should be no more than 2.5 times the buyer's annual income. That means that a $400,000 house would require an income of at least $160,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Census Bureau reported that in 2003, only 12 percent of Suffolk households had an income of $150,000 or more, she said. In Nassau, only about 8 percent of the households had an annual income of $200,000 or more.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''About 10 percent of Long Islanders on average can afford a median-price home today,'' Dr. Kamer said. ''That's a shocker.''  </p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Do Try This at Home: Assess Your Area's Real Estate Bubble  </span>
</div><div class="author">By DAMON DARLIN  </div><div>1838 words</div><div>13 August 2005</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2005 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the first time since the residential real estate marathon began 13 years ago, parts of the country are showing signs of exhaustion. But if you rely on the experts to declare that a particular area's bubble has popped, you may have waited too long.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So how can a homeowner tell if a market is about to go bust? This may be one of those rare occasions when professionals parsing data are at a disadvantage to regular people watching the market. That's because the main driver of today's market is consumer psychology. Home prices go up as long as people expect them to go up.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When they stop believing, prices fall -- and no economist in Washington can get wind of that faster than someone chatting over knockwurst at a neighborhood block party. ''Economists looking at the macrodata will be the last to know,'' said Richard A. Brown, chief economist at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What you will learn from the professionals who are dutifully crunching numbers is that prices are not falling significantly in any of the hot markets, but in a dozen or so cities in the Northeast and in California, they are near the peak. In Boston, for example, the time that homes are sitting on the market has stretched to 46 days from 39 days a year ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An analysis of price appreciation, done for The New York Times by the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard, shows that the price appreciation in cities including New York City; Austin, Tex.; Philadelphia; and Providence, R.I., are decelerating. Appreciation in Detroit and Denver has already slowed to a crawl.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's taking a lot longer to sell a home,'' says Karl A. Martone, a Re/Max Properties agent in Providence, where homes now sit on the market an average of 65 days, up from 14 days a year ago. The region has almost six months of inventory, which is up 35 percent from a year ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vicki Doran, a real estate agent with Coldwell Banker in Providence, says: ''It's switching to a buyer's market. Last year buyers had to snap things up. Now they can shop around.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even a few markets in hard-charging California -- San Diego, Orange County and Santa Cruz -- are part of the trend, according to data from the first three months of the year. Data for the second quarter to be released by the government on Sept. 1 may confirm the trend. But already Christopher Thornberg, senior forecaster at UCLA Anderson Forecast, a service of the University of California, Los Angeles, says California has ''peaked and is already coming down the back side.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, David A. Lereah, the chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, said that the housing market was ''probably close to a peak right now.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take a look at the hot San Diego condo market. In Park Place, one of the many sleek towers of condominiums recently slung up around Petco Park, a one-bedroom condo is offered for $719,000. Someone buying it would expect to make mortgage payments of about $3,775 a month, plus monthly maintenance fees.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But someone really wanting to live in the high-rise, with hardwood floors, granite countertops and city views for a lot less, could rent a nearly identical unit in the same building for $2,400 a month. That is clear evidence prices have to move down. You are more apt to see that the price of residential property no longer is connected to its underlying value than a person looking only at spreadsheets of sales data.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices in overheated markets must, by definition, come back down to the mean. Knowing which way the market is headed before buying or selling is extremely important to anyone who wants to protect the wealth tied up in a house. And it certainly matters to anyone who is thinking of buying because it never makes much sense to buy at the top of the market. ''The turning point is pretty important,'' Mr. Brown said, ''because the trend will play out for years.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trouble is, economists have been wrong before when they try to call the market. Three years ago, Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, said that it would be only a matter of months before prices began to fall. Prognosticators at the research firm Economy.com declared that the peak was last summer. Celia Chen, the firm's director for housing economics, is now saying that it will come this year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The timing is always difficult with these things,'' admits Ian Morris, chief United States economist at HSBC Securities U.S.A., who made the same call, repeatedly.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Karevoll, an analyst with DataQuick Information Systems, which provides real estate data to lenders, said: ''We've been told for years that the peak is just around the corner. The economists have so much egg on their faces.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't be too hard on them. It's the nature of their science. N. Gregory Mankiw, the Harvard University professor and former head of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, made one of the most famous miscalls. In 1989 he wrote a paper arguing that the aging of the baby boomers was going to undermine the housing market in the 1990's and 2000's. Whoops.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though it appears the shift is now at hand, the end of the bubble will not look anything like the crash in the stock market after the technology bubble. The stock market turns frenetic when investors scramble to get out and prices fall sharply. In housing, however, a collapse is signaled by a sharp drop in activity as people hold off buying. Houses stay on the market longer. Inventories grow. Only then will prices fall, slowly. Economists say prices will lag a slowdown in the market by four to six months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the data on where a local market is headed is available on the Internet (links are at nytimes.com/business). In other cases, your real estate agent is your best friend. He or she has access to a storehouse of raw data from the local Multiple Listing Service. Here are some indicators to look at:  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARKET ACTIVITY -- How many homes are sold compared with the month before is the earliest indicator, but it is notorious for false positives. But if the number of homes sold starts to drop, perk up. Every county tracks this and makes it available to the public.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">INVENTORY -- Some of the most crucial pieces of information are held closely by real estate agents. The number of houses on the market is one of them. The national average is 4.3 months; 6 months is closer to normal, the National Association of Realtors says. When it grows, there is trouble coming.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TIME ON THE MARKET -- Agents control access to this information, and be warned: they know how to manipulate it. A house that has been languishing can be taken off and put back to look like a fresh listing. But you'll still be able to see the average time stretching as a clear signal of cooling.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PRICES -- It's what you care about most. But month-to-month comparisons are nearly useless as an indicator because sales of a few houses on either end of the market can skew the figures. DataQuick at  www.dqnews.com [http://www.dqnews.com] has some data and the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight issues quarterly reports.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FAILED TO SELL -- The super-secret indicator among agents is the number of houses that are quietly taken off the market -- usually because they are priced too high. Wheedle the number out of them and you'll have a strong indicator of market health.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PRICE-TO-RENT RATIO -- This is a wonderful measure that gets at the intrinsic value of a property, but it's a tricky tool for the layman. Rent data include everything from studios to four-bedroom penthouses, making a comparison with single-family homes difficult. Some of the rent data can be found at  www.realfacts.com [http://www.realfacts.com].  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LOAN QUALITY -- The popularity of interest-only mortgages could become one of the best indicators of a fragile market, several economists say. Mr. Thornberg of UCLA Anderson says it's a sign that lenders are scraping the bottom of the barrel. ''We are close to running out of shills,'' he says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RISK -- The PMI Group of Walnut Creek, Calif., a provider of data to the mortgage industry, estimates how much prices could drop using an econometric model. It publishes the list of at-risk cities at  www.pmigroup.com [http://www.pmigroup.com].  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">POPULAR SENTIMENT -- To judge from the media, the housing bubble may have peaked in June. According to a Nexis search of magazines and newspapers, that month was the peak, with 312 references to ''housing bubble,'' almost six times that of a year earlier. It fell 24 percent in July.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, there is one constant: real estate agent sentiment. Most of them will never tire of saying it's a great time to buy. Despite the signs of a slowdown, Mr. Martone, the Providence real estate agent, says prices are holding and he still does not have enough properties to sell. He says, ''I am the eternal optimist.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Re ''That Hissing Sound'' (column, Aug. 8):</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Krugman thinks that everyone -- not just owners of coastal real estate -- should be worried about the possible end of the housing bubble. It's hard to see why. Current housing prices are completely out of sync with wages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As 30-something prospective first-time home buyers, my wife and I (we have one child) find ourselves completely priced out of the New York market, despite a six-figure household income. And the prospect of affording still more space for an expanded family seems beyond a pipe dream.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I, for one, hope that the housing bubble bursts, and bursts spectacularly, not with reduced rates of appreciation but with dramatic falls in value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When only millionaires can own a family home, we're in desperate need of a major correction.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the way the bubble ends: not with a pop, but with a hiss.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing prices move much more slowly than stock prices. There are no Black Mondays, when prices fall 23 percent in a day. In fact, prices often keep rising for a while even after a housing boom goes bust.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the news that the U.S. housing bubble is over won't come in the form of plunging prices; it will come in the form of falling sales and rising inventory, as sellers try to get prices that buyers are no longer willing to pay. And the process may already have started.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, some people still deny that there's a housing bubble. Let me explain how we know that they're wrong.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One piece of evidence is the sense of frenzy about real estate, which irresistibly brings to mind the stock frenzy of 1999. Even some of the players are the same. The authors of the 1999 best seller ''Dow 36,000'' are now among the most vocal proponents of the view that there is no housing bubble.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there are the numbers. Many bubble deniers point to average prices for the country as a whole, which look worrisome but not totally crazy. When it comes to housing, however, the United States is really two countries, Flatland and the Zoned Zone.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Flatland, which occupies the middle of the country, it's easy to build houses. When the demand for houses rises, Flatland metropolitan areas, which don't really have traditional downtowns, just sprawl some more. As a result, housing prices are basically determined by the cost of construction. In Flatland, a housing bubble can't even get started.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the Zoned Zone, which lies along the coasts, a combination of high population density and land-use restrictions -- hence ''zoned'' -- makes it hard to build new houses. So when people become willing to spend more on houses, say because of a fall in mortgage rates, some houses get built, but the prices of existing houses also go up. And if people think that prices will continue to rise, they become willing to spend even more, driving prices still higher, and so on. In other words, the Zoned Zone is prone to housing bubbles.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Zoned Zone housing prices, which have risen much faster than the national average, clearly point to a bubble.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the nation as a whole, housing prices rose about 50 percent between the first quarter of 2000 and the first quarter of 2005. But that average blends results from Flatland metropolitan areas like Houston and Atlanta, where prices rose 26 and 29 percent respectively, with results from Zoned Zone areas like New York, Miami and San Diego, where prices rose 77, 96 and 118 percent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nobody would pay San Diego prices without believing that prices will continue to rise. Rents rose much more slowly than prices: the Bureau of Labor Statistics index of ''owners' equivalent rent'' rose only 27 percent from late 1999 to late 2004. Business Week reports that by 2004 the cost of renting a house in San Diego was only 40 percent of the cost of owning a similar house -- even taking into account low interest rates on mortgages. So it makes sense to buy in San Diego only if you believe that prices will keep rising rapidly, generating big capital gains. That's pretty much the definition of a bubble.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bubbles end when people stop believing that big capital gains are a sure thing. That's what happened in San Diego at the end of its last housing bubble: after a rapid rise, house prices peaked in 1990. Soon there was a glut of houses on the market, and prices began falling. By 1996, they had declined about 25 percent after adjusting for inflation.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that's what's happening in San Diego right now, after a rise in house prices that dwarfs the boom of the 1980's. The number of single-family houses and condos on the market has doubled over the past year. ''Homes that a year or two ago sold virtually overnight -- in many cases triggering bidding wars -- are on the market for weeks,'' reports The Los Angeles Times. The same thing is happening in other formerly hot markets.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the U.S. economy has become deeply dependent on the housing bubble. The economic recovery since 2001 has been disappointing in many ways, but it wouldn't have happened at all without soaring spending on residential construction, plus a surge in consumer spending largely based on mortgage refinancing. Did I mention that the personal savings rate has fallen to zero?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now we're starting to hear a hissing sound, as the air begins to leak out of the bubble. And everyone -- not just those who own Zoned Zone real estate -- should be worried.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE number of homes for sale on Long Island and in Queens in June was 22 percent higher this year compared with the same time last year, signaling, some say, that prices have been raised too high for many buyers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The numbers come from the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island, a network of about 2,300 real estate offices in Long Island and Queens. The service also reports that median home sale prices are still rising in Nassau and Suffolk, but at a slower rate.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of people are trying to cash in on the boom before it goes away,'' said Irwin Kellner, the Weller professor of economics at Hofstra University and chief economist for North Fork Bank.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With more people putting homes on the market at ever higher prices, the supply is starting to outpace demand, Mr. Kellner said. ''I think I see the beginnings of a cooling for the housing boom right now on Long Island,'' he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate brokers have encountered both edgy sellers and savvier buyers, saying that news reports on the real estate market have added to the uncertainty and anxiety on both sides.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers also say that more older homeowners are trying to cash in on the equity in their homes and fatten their retirement nest egg.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Evelyn Atanas, the owner of Atanas Realty in Williston Park, said many homeowners she has encountered are worried about housing prices leveling off.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The sellers are very nervous,'' Ms. Atanas said. ''I had people in today who were saying: 'What should I do? Should I sell? Should I rent?'''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kathy Anastasio of Anastasio Associates in Huntington said that she still sees a lot of buyers, but that lately sellers slightly outnumber them.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have some people trying to cash in, but we also have more sellers because they're asking more than they should, more than it will appraise for, more than it will actually sell for,'' Ms. Anastasio said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Anastasio, who specializes in the Huntington market in Suffolk County, said there were 762 more homes for sale in the Town of Huntington during the first six months of 2005 than during the same period last year, while the number of homes sold during that time declined by 184, according to numbers from the Multiple Listing Service.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sharon Topper, of Topper Realty in Long Beach, said that unsold houses are accumulating because sellers are holding out for a high offer, and because there are so many hesitant buyers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have a lot of people sitting in high-priced rentals who sold their homes,'' Ms. Topper said. ''They're sitting in $4,000-a-month rentals waiting for the bubble to burst.'' Homes are still selling at all-time highs in Long Beach, Ms. Topper said, especially condos and co-ops with ocean views, but ''a lot of houses are $100,000 overpriced, and people are sitting and waiting on those.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sale price for a home, according to the Long Island Board of Realtors, in both Suffolk and Nassau Counties rose 10.5 percent, to $436,000 in June, compared with the same month last year. That was less than the previous year's increase in prices, which was 12.4 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They're beginning to slow down, though 10 percent is nothing to sneeze at," Mr. Kellner said of the change in home price increases.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lost in the Multiple Listing Service reports is data on the very expensive houses on the East End, where many real estate offices are not members of the services.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers say that demand and prices on the East End are still very strong and that there is no excess inventory. ''In the village of Southampton, there's not a whole lot'' of homes at the high end, according to Dottie Herman, chief executive of Prudential Douglas Elliman.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Numbers in the luxury market can be deceiving, she added, if not tempered with knowledge of the yearly trends.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suffolk Research Service, a firm that tracks East End real estate transactions, reports that in Southampton, for example, 12 percent fewer homes were sold in the first six months of 2005 than in the same period last year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's down from a 39.5 percent increase in sales in the first six months of 2004.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ms. Herman said that the important sales numbers for the Southampton market turn up in September and October, after homeowners have collected their summer seasonal rents and decide to sell their homes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Over the summer, my offices have all done well,'' Ms. Herman said of her firm's East End business. ''And the high end is still very strong.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Academics who study real estate trends across the country note that while there may be a surplus of homes on the market, they may not be in the kinds of places people want or can afford.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That appears to be the case in Long Island. ''If you look for a town house or a condo or anything on Long Island, there's not enough supply,'' said Clifford Sondock, president of the Jericho-based Land Use Institute, a real estate and planning think tank.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said that between the start of 2000 through November 2004, new home construction on Long Island had declined by 68 percent. Nationwide, he said, there was an increase of 18 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In order to maintain a level average home price in any market, you need to build at least four new homes per thousand people'' each year, Mr. Sondock said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But fewer than two homes per thousand people are built each year on Long Island, he said, largely because of zoning regulations that restrict builders to producing single-family homes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In areas like Houston and Las Vegas, relaxed zoning has resulted in up to 60 percent increases in new construction.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The problem with a restrictive market like Long Island is the builders produce what the political system will allow,'' Mr. Sondock said. ''So if there's a demand for town homes, which are more dense, but the political system doesn't allow more density, the builders will produce single-family homes instead.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing affordability index from the National Association of Realtors dropped sharply in the second quarter of 2005, compared with both the previous quarter and the second quarter a year ago. The index measures the ability of a family earning the median income to buy a home at the median price, using conservative financing and a 20 percent down payment.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the same period, existing home sales hit a record. What gives?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For starters, even with purchasing power on the wane, the typical family can still afford the typical home, though not as comfortably as before. The Realtors' index put the median family income in the second quarter of 2005 at $56,917 nationally, which is considered adequate to cover a house costing $251,900, according to the group's calculations. The median price for an existing home was $208,500.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That doesn't mean much in a hot market like California's, where the median price is $530,430. And first-time home buyers around the country are being priced out, with renters failing by a widening margin to reach the income level at which they would qualify for a mortgage on a typically priced home.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fact that the home-buying spree continues is due mainly to incredibly easy mortgage money. More than 4 out of 10 first-time home buyers are putting no money down, and hot markets are rife with mortgages that allow buyers to make interest-only payments early on.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's precisely that sort of what-me-worry activity that the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, is seeking to quell with his steady interest rate increases. So far, prices have continued to rise along with rising rates, leading to that affordability crunch. But sooner or later, the rate increases will kick in, and the market will cool. The adjustment could be orderly or disorderly, with collapses in some areas.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even a soft landing, however, would probably have a big impact on employment and consumer spending. For policy makers and consumers, the better part of prudence would be to assume that rising unaffordability was an early warning sign that the market was nearing a top.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PAUL NELSON had never seen Paraiso del Mar, a resort and golf community in La Paz, Mexico, on the Baja Peninsula, before he signed a contract to buy a $200,000 beachfront condominium there. And he didn't even consider flying down to check it out before putting down a deposit.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I thought in the very worst case, at $200,000, I'm not going to get hurt that bad,'' said Mr. Nelson, 58, a semiretired songwriter from Nashville. ''I don't lose any sleep.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nelson is just one of a growing number of people who are bidding on investment properties, second homes, even primary residences, before seeing what they are buying. Indeed, buyers from Las Vegas to Manhattan have recently signed deals for as much as $2.25 million to buy places they've never been in, according to local brokers and their clients. Though the National Association of Mortgage Brokers and the National Association of Realtors have no data on purchases made sight unseen, officials at both groups say they are hearing more anecdotal reports of these sales than ever.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Nine years ago you would never have heard of this,'' said Jim Nabors, president of the National Association of Mortgage Brokers. ''We have no empirical data, but you go to a conference and you hear people talking about this more and more. I'd say the numbers have probably increased dramatically.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With economists expecting a record eight million-plus houses and other residences to sell in 2005, people are worried they will miss opportunities if they don't buy, especially with prices in some markets rising $20,000 in a matter of months, said David Lereah, chief economist with the National Association of Realtors and author of ''Are You Missing the Real Estate Boom?'' Last year, 36 percent of all real estate sales, or about $560 billion, were of vacation homes and investment properties, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans are not the only ones jumping at properties they haven't visited. Lynne Knapp, a Realtor who runs BestBrowardProperty.com, based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., said that this year she has sold British buyers two homes, each for about $1 million, that the clients had only seen in e-mailed photographs. Part of the reason international buyers are willing to take a gamble is that American properties are relatively cheap.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With the exchange of the euro right now, people buying property today are getting a 24-percent-off coupon compared to people who bought with euros three years ago,'' said Ron Shuffield, president of Miami-based Esslinger-Wooten-Maxwell Realtors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, with more information available on the Web, ''sight unseen is kind of a misnomer,'' said Gary Garland, owner of Crested Butte Real Estate in Colorado. ''It's not like we're sending buyers Polaroids like we used to.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Virtual tours'' of vacation properties displayed over the Internet help people like Mr. Nelson, of Nashville, who also bought an $800,000 investment home sight unseen in Fort Lauderdale a few years ago, size up their purchases. ''If people can establish relationships over the Internet without seeing each other and get married, they can use the Internet to buy a home sight unseen,'' said Todd Costigan, a senior manager at the Center for Realtor Technology in Chicago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, a survey released in November 2004 by the National Association of Realtors that studied, in part, homebuyers' Internet use found that the link between the Web and buying sight unseen might not be as strong as people think. Of the 8,205 people surveyed who bought or sold houses in 2004, slightly more than half said they used the Internet ''frequently'' when shopping for property. Of those users, 3 percent said they visited zero homes before deciding to buy, including the homes they purchased. Sixteen percent of people who did not use the Internet frequently said they bought a house they had not visited during their hunt. The researchers who conducted the survey say that some home buyers may have seen the property at an earlier time, however.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, sight-unseen buyers often say they are familiar with the area where they've bought or have friends or relatives nearby who can look at a house on their behalf. Sales are nearly always contingent upon a home inspection, but rarely contingent upon actually seeing the property.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Sales move too fast for us to allow that,'' said John Fair, a developer behind Paraiso del Mar. When finished in 10 to 12 years, Paraiso del Mar is expected to have 2,000 condominiums, 1,500 homes, 1,000 hotel rooms, 2 golf courses and a 550-slip marina, though the development currently does not have completed roads. About half of the 350 units purchased so far -- $50 million in sales -- have sold to people who hadn't visited the site first, Mr. Fair said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But buying property without seeing it in person is not risk free. Principally, the hot markets pushing sales could soon slow down. As the market cools to what Mr. Lereah expects will be single-digit growth, there will be fewer sight-unseen purchases, he said. ''People can get overexcited,'' Mr. Lereah said. ''That should go away.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers can also be in for surprises when they finally see their properties. When Randy Burns, a retired Navy officer in San Diego, bought a $176,000 home in Spokane, Wash., without first seeing it, he had been warned that the walls were pink and that the kitchen was small. What the family member who had checked it out for him hadn't said was that the cooking area was so tiny that ''once you step in you feel like you are in a box,'' he said. Over all, though, he said the purchase had gone smoothly.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ellen Ashley, 55, a Realtor from Portola Valley, Calif., signed a contract on a $650,000, 2,500-square-foot home on Vashon Island near Seattle that looked great on the Internet. Only when she visited it for the inspection did she find out about the noise from a nearby road. She was able to get out of the purchase.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that didn't stop her when she found a $680,000 waterfront home with four bedrooms and two baths in Maine, also on the Web. Without visiting, she made an offer and, once it was accepted, flew out to see the views. Even then, she had to go on trust. ''It was hazy, and I was nervous, but I trusted them,'' Ms. Ashley said. ''I could hear the water lapping. I just couldn't see it all.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IT may seem absurd that David and Christine Boals, a Manhattan couple with two young children, wound up in a $4,400-a-month rental in Chelsea.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With more than $100,000 in profit from the sale of a one-bedroom apartment last year, and Ms. Boals's income as the owner of a photo agency, it never occurred to them that they wouldn't be able to trade up to a bigger place for their family. But like a growing number of equity-rich homeowners, they discovered that their money did not go nearly as far as they had hoped.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the hottest markets, owners whose homes have skyrocketed in value find themselves in a frustrating paradox. They were supposed to be the lucky ones: they bought in frenzied real estate markets like New York and Los Angeles three or more years ago and have amassed hundreds of thousands of dollars on paper.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as they try to roll that considerable equity into a bigger home, many are unpleasantly surprised to find that the cost of real estate at the higher end has outpaced their ability to buy. For homeowners who have watched the torrid housing market create wealth as if by magic, scanning the classified ads or visiting a few open houses serves as a harsh reality check.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the Boalses, who had owned their previous apartment for just three years, the best option was a $950,000 unit that had gone unrenovated for 30 years. But since it was only slightly larger than the apartment they had just sold -- and would require a mortgage nearly twice as large as their previous one -- the couple decided to rent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trading up ''is becoming harder and harder, even for people who are technically wealthy,'' Mr. Boals said last week as he took a break from his duties as a stay-at-home father for his daughter, 3, and son, 16 months.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Families have always dreamed of the extra bedroom or the larger yard. But now that their current homes have shot up in value, their expectations for a lifestyle upgrade are even higher. The problem now is that in cities like Boston, New York and San Francisco the number of people vying to move up exceeds the number of larger places for sale.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You often think, 'Geez, I have this huge windfall,' but your neighbors and the people in the building next door have the same windfall,'' said Christopher J. Mayer, a professor of real estate at the Columbia Business School in New York. ''There are a lot of people who want to trade up, so that's really the problem they are facing.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some places prices of bigger homes are hitting records, putting them out of the reach of even those who, on paper at least, have accumulated considerable wealth. In Manhattan the average price of a two-bedroom apartment is now $1.5 million, according to Miller Samuel, a New York real estate appraiser, while three-bedrooms average $3.6 million. In Cupertino, Calif., the average price of a four-bedroom house is nearly $1.1 million, according to the Silicon Valley Association of Realtors.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Incomes have not kept pace. The average earnings for private-sector workers in Manhattan went up 10 percent between 2000 and 2004, according to Jason Bram, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Average prices for co-ops and condos in Manhattan increased by 41 percent in the same period.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gap is widening nationwide, too. Economy.com, a research firm, says that five years ago, a household bringing in the median national income could afford to trade up to a home that cost 61 percent more than the median house price. Today such a household can afford a place only 44 percent more expensive; that figure is the lowest in 15 years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One result is that homeowners who might have followed the traditional path from starter home to dream house in a few years are now deferring the dream. Kim Orchen Cooper, a freelance casting director, and her husband, Roger Cooper, a film editor, bought a two-and-a-half-bedroom town house in Santa Monica, Calif., in 2001 for $415,000. After their daughter, Rylee, was born last year, the couple yearned for a bigger house with a full backyard.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Considering recent sales in their neighborhood, they say they might get about $800,000 for the town house. But Ms. Cooper said that a simple stand-alone house nearby would start at about $1.1 million. Even with the equity from their current home, ''that would still be a $700,000 loan,'' she said, adding, ''We can't afford it.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some buyers might be able to finance a move up but can't stomach the bidding wars and the stratospheric prices that confront them. Pier Charter, a real estate agent at Brown Bear Realty in San Francisco, said he has worked with at least a dozen people in the last year who decided to renovate after losing out to bidders who offered as much as 30 percent over the asking price.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Even if your ideal house came up,'' Mr. Charter said, ''there's absolutely no guarantee that one will get it unless one throws obscene amounts of money at it.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many families are shocked at how little their newfound wealth will buy. In over a year of looking, Shauna Swerland Youssefnia and her husband, David Youssefnia, have not found anything they believe justifies cashing out of their current Manhattan apartment. Ms. Youssefnia, a recruiting firm executive, bought the one-bedroom five years ago, before she married Mr. Youssefnia, who owns his own consulting business, and she said the value of the apartment has almost doubled since then.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's so unbelievable what you get for your money,'' she said. ''Even if you stretch yourself all you get is an extra room. It doesn't mean more closet space or outdoor space or storage space.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When their son, Max, was born eight months ago, they installed a temporary wall in the dining room to create a room for him. Now, Ms. Youssefnia said, ''David and I keep joking that Max is going to grow up in the dining room.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some buyers forge ahead, but end up taking out riskier mortgages simply to afford the monthly payments. Marie Kuranishi and her husband, Tony Guinta, sold a condo earlier this year in Playa del Rey, Calif., a suburb of Los Angeles, for $450,000, nearly twice what they had paid for it, and bought a $632,000 house in a more remote suburb. To finance the jump, they took out two interest-only loans, paying no principal for a fixed period. Even so, their mortgage payments have gone up by more than $1,000 a month.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The wealth the market created in their condo is already a distant memory. Now, Ms. Kuranishi said, the couple worry about how to cover their bills.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some owners are taking their profits and escaping the frothiest markets. Earlier this year, David Wolf, a commercial real estate broker, and his wife, Marie-Josee Henri, a lawyer, sold their two-bedroom co-op on the Upper West Side for close to $900,000, three and a half years after they paid just under $550,000 for it.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After concluding that they would not find a three-bedroom they liked for less than $1.7 million, they took their equity and moved with their 22-month-old daughter, Alexie-Emmanuelle, to Montreal, Ms. Henri's hometown. They bought a five-bedroom house for the equivalent of $960,000. Buying in Manhattan, Mr. Wolf said, ''would have stretched us to a place we didn't want to go.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most New Yorkers whose equity has soared seem resigned to staying where they are. Several mothers at the 96th Street playground in Central Park last week said that despite rapid appreciation in the value of their homes, they were planning to let two children share a bedroom indefinitely.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As her 4-year-old son, Leander, and 2-year-old daughter, Celeste, piled onto her lap, Jennifer Sheridan said her impotent paper wealth had provoked a recurring reverie. ''I had this dream about finding this room in my apartment that I did not know about,'' she said.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nation's roaring housing market set its second record in three months as sales of existing homes climbed 2.7 percent in June, to 7.33 million, according to a report released yesterday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low mortgage rates and strong demand drove the frenetic sales activity, which defied expectations that the market was starting to cool, at least in some of the hottest regions. The median price -- half the homes sold were more expensive, half were less expensive -- rose at nearly its highest annual pace in almost 25 years, 14.7 percent, to a record $219,000. It was just short of the April year-over-year advance of 15.1 percent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average sales price climbed 9.4 percent, to $268,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report, from the National Association of Realtors, provides yet another sign that the housing market remains vibrant and is playing a big part in the nation's economic expansion. But it added to fears among some economists and policy makers that the boom might eventually turn into a bust in some locations.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The locations showing the greatest gains in prices were in the West, where the median price for the region was up 17.4 percent, and in the Northeast, where the median price rose 13.6 percent. The median price gains in the Midwest and the South were smaller, but still healthy: 12.7 percent for the Midwest and 9 percent in the South.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales for June broke a record set in April, when 7.18 million homes traded hands. Sales fell slightly in May, to 7.14 million. Analysts had been expecting 7.15 million sales in June.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's fairly astounding what is going on and with rates not moving up there is no sign of it ending anytime soon,'' said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist for MFR Inc., an economic research firm in New York.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low mortgage rates have been driving the market for the last few years, prompting some economists to suggest the nation is experiencing a housing bubble that will eventually burst and deal the economy a significant setback.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, median prices are 40.2 percent higher than they were in 2002. In the West and the Northeast -- the regions with the greatest growth -- they are up 49.9 percent and 56 percent, respectively. The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage had a 5.73 percent rate last week, down from 5.98 percent a year ago, according to Freddie Mac.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors, which represents real estate agents, contends that low mortgage rates are one of several factors driving home sales. The others are an improving economy, strong housing demand and a supply shortage.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Eventually, appreciation rates will slow and come down to normal levels when the shortage of homes on the market improves and comes closer into balance, hopefully, by the second half of next year,'' Al Mansell, the group's president, said in a statement.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But economists who subscribe to the bubble view say that gradual easing may be wishful thinking.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Those are hopes and it may be exactly what happens, but what we know is that the longer bubbles are allowed to go unchecked the more painful they are,'' said Stephen S. Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve has been raising short-term interest rates -- now at 3.25 percent -- to try to restrain economic growth and inflation. But those increases have had little impact on the long-term interest rates that drive the housing markets.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long-term rates have been kept low in part by demand for United States Treasury notes from Asian buyers, particularly the central banks of China, Japan and Korea, Mr. Roach said. Those countries are buying dollars to help keep their currencies relatively low compared to the dollar.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China's decision last week to let its currency, the yuan, deviate from a fixed rate with the American dollar could eventually lead to higher long-term rates here, Mr. Roach said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for now, Asia's demand remains unchecked. ''That's playing a huge role in keeping this housing bubble going,'' Mr. Roach added.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, July 19 -- Housing starts were flat in June but permits for future construction shot higher, indicating that groundbreaking could increase in the months ahead, the Commerce Department reported on Tuesday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The housing sector remains very strong,'' said David Resler, the chief economist at Nomura Securities International in New York. ''Building permits are strong, and it's more encouraging news for the general economy.''  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family housing starts dropped 2.5 percent, to an annual pace of 1.667 million units. But that was offset by multifamily starts, which rose 14.2 percent, to a 337,000 pace, the report said. Permits for groundbreaking, an indicator of builder confidence, rose 2.4 percent, to a 2.111 million unit pace. That exceeded expectations for an increase to an annual pace of 2.080 million units in June from a 2.062 million pace in May.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FOUR years ago this month, two spiffy new two-family homes opened as models for new construction in a seriously deteriorated Newark neighborhood off Route 78 near Newark Liberty International Airport.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two brick-front colonials, each with a three-bedroom, two-bath owner's unit on the second floor and a slightly less roomy tenant's apartment on the first floor, signaled the start of a grand redevelopment plan. It aims eventually to provide 1,500 new homes in Newark -- doubling the number of owner-occupied dwellings that existed in the whole city in the year 2000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People were wildly interested from the start,'' said Ken Baris, president of Jordan Baris Realty, which is marketing the homes at Southwyck Estates, the 240-unit first phase of development under the plan. ''We signed 10 contracts that first week, and the developers -- Summit Real Estate -- took the ball and ran as fast as possible.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, there are 100 two-family houses up -- whole blocks of them in some places; in others, new buildings interspersed with old. And demand for the homes remains strong. The model at Southwyck Estates that sold for $210,000 when the project started is now listed for $400,000.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The existing two- to four-family structures that dot the area fanning out from the corner of Hillside Avenue and Runyon Street in Newark's South Ward have not gotten any younger, Mr. Baris noted. ''Still, they seem to look a little more upright, if only by association,'' he laughed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The neighborhood, which was really one of the most challenged in the city of Newark, is now really a place anybody can feel comfortable walking around in,'' Mr. Baris added.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the impact seems to be even more widespread than that. The average sale price for single-family homes in Newark has grown significantly, according to the Garden State Multiple Listing Service figures analyzed by Jordan Baris, a firm that has dominated the Newark residential market for the last half-century. The firm was founded in 1952 by Ken Baris's father, who remains its chief executive.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think it's clear that the new construction and creation of a stable multifamily neighborhood are helping to increase the overall property values of Newark,'' the younger Mr. Baris said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average sale price of a single-family home in the first quarter of this year soared 32 percent over the average price a year earlier, rising to $201,050 from $151,909, according to his analysis.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the final numbers for the second quarter of 2005 are not yet available, enough figures are in to know that sale prices averaged 30 percent more than in 2004, indicating the trend has staying power, Mr. Baris said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average time on the market increased from 76 in the first quarter to 88 days in the second quarter, he said, adding that this was not a surprising development in light of slightly higher mortgage interest rates.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The percentage increase in average sale price for Newark was sharply higher than that for all of Essex County, where Newark is the county seat. The average price in Essex County rose 18 percent, to $459,602.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Union and Morris Counties, where Jordan Baris also maintains offices and sells homes, the average prices were up 15 and 16 percent, respectively, this year over last, Mr. Baris said, adding that Newark does not provide a majority of his company's sales.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The volume of sales in Newark is on the rise, though,'' he said. ''In the first three months of this year, there were 72 sales -- up 24 percent over the same period the year before.'' In the second quarter, the number of sales was also up more than 20 percent, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Affordability'' is probably the main reason that prices in Newark rose faster than values in the surrounding counties, Mr. Baris said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Some buyers are worried about today's high prices and a possible decline in high-end values,'' he said. ''Moderately priced homes are increasingly seen as a safer, less-volatile investment.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think home prices in Newark increased the most because owner-occupants and investors have decided that's where the room for growth in value is,'' Mr. Baris continued. ''High-end prices are more sensitive to factors such as Wall Street bonuses and stock market performance. The more affordable a price is, the less you are tied to economic factors.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Southwyck Estates, most of the homes are sold before they are built. The buyers are prequalified and may receive counseling on the basics of home ownership and being a landlord. Part of the appeal of a two-family home, of course, has traditionally been that a stable rent income helps pay the mortgage.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with prices rising so fast at Southwyck, Mr. Baris said, he is beginning to see buyers who are weighing the options. ''Some people ask themselves: should we buy a new two-family for $400,000, or a larger house, built in 1940, with no tenant, probably no garage, maybe an old kitchen for $125,000 less?''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some other older neighborhoods are experiencing significant increases in average sale price too, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He mentioned the Vailsburg and Ivy Hill neighborhoods, which run along the Newark border with Maplewood and South Orange. ''You can drive into Ivy Hill, and you won't know you've left South Orange,'' Mr. Baris asserted. ''The prices there have gone way up, but they're still much lower than South Orange, so it has become very attractive.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Forest Hill neighborhood, replete with huge Victorians and old stone manors, the asking prices have also skyrocketed in the last few years, Mr. Baris said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You've gone from a situation where you might have sold a house for $225,000 three or four years ago, and the owner would give you a big hug at the closing, to one where asking prices are hitting $600,000,'' he said. ''I saw one on the market recently for $699,000.''  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jordan Baris harks back 20 years, to a time when the city had so much abandoned and vacant property fall into its hands that it had to hire his company just to make a simple inventory. His 41-year-old son recalls when property owners were so eager to get rid of their houses and apartment buildings that hundreds of them actually paid a $150 fee to the city to take them.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Given all this, Newark is becoming an incredible success story,'' the younger Mr. Baris said. ''The numbers are really up. You can't even argue with it.''  </p>
