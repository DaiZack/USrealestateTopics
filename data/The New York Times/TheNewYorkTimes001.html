<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low interest rates are one reason that the housing market has taken off. They are far from the only one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert S. Kaplan, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, has been nervously eyeing the housing market as he ponders the path ahead for monetary policy. Home prices are rising at a double-digit pace this year. The typical house in and around the city he calls home sold for $306,031 in June of this year, Zillow estimates, up from $261,710 a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several of Mr. Kaplan’s colleagues harbor similar concerns. They are worried that the housing boom could end up looking like a bubble, one that threatens financial stability. And some fret that the central bank’s big bond purchases could be helping to inflate it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s making me nervous that you’ve got this incipient housing bubble, with anecdotal reports backed up by a lot of the data,” James Bullard, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, said during a call with reporters Friday. He doesn’t think things are at crisis levels yet, but he believes the Fed should avoid fueling the situation further. “We got in so much trouble with the housing bubble in the mid-2000s.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Policymakers don’t need to look far to see escalating prices, because housing is growing more expensive nearly everywhere. Buying a typical home in Boise, Idaho, cost about $469,000 in June, up from $335,000 a year ago, based on Zillow estimates of local housing values. A typical house in Boone, N.C., is worth $362,000, up from $269,000. Prices nationally have risen 15 percent over the past year, Zillow’s data shows, in line with the closely watched S&amp;P <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> Case-Shiller index of home prices, which rose a record[https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sp-corelogic-case-shiller-index-reports-record-high-annual-home-price-gain-of-16-6-in-may-301342183.html] 16.6 percent in the year through May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bidding wars are frustrating buyers. Agents are struggling to navigate frantic competition. About half of small bankers in a recent industry survey said the current state of the housing market poses “a serious risk[https://www-americanbanker-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/news/small-banks-spooked-by-home-price-surge-survey-shows]” to the United States economy. Lawmakers and economic policymakers alike are hoping things calm down — especially because frothy home prices could eventually spill into rent prices, worsening affordability for low-income families just as they face the end of pandemic-era eviction moratoriums[https://www-nytimes-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/2021/07/29/us/politics/eviction-moratorium-biden-congress.html] and, in some cases, months of owed rent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industry experts say the current home price boom emerged from a cocktail of low interest rates, booming demand and supply bottlenecks. In short, it’s a situation that many are feeling acutely with no single policy to blame and no easy fix.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fed officials face a particularly tricky calculus when it comes to housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their policies definitely help to drive demand. Bond-buying and low Fed interest rates make mortgages cheap, inspiring people to borrow more and buy bigger. But rates aren’t the sole factor behind the home price craze. It also traces back to demographics, a pandemic-spurred desire for space, and a very limited supply of new and existing homes for sale — factors outside of the central bank’s control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Interest rates are one factor that’s supporting demand, but we really can’t do much about the supply side,” Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, explained during recent congressional testimony.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s an unattractive prospect to pull back monetary support to try to rein in housing specifically, because doing so would slow the overall economy, making it harder for the central bank to foster full employment. The Fed’s policy-setting committee voted[https://www-nytimes-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/2021/07/28/business/economy/fomc-fed-meeting-rates-taper.html] Wednesday to keep policy set to full-support mode, and Mr. Powell said at a subsequent news conference that the economy remains short of the central bank’s jobs target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But central bank officials also monitor financial stability, so they are keenly watching the price surge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for housing was strong in 2018 and 2019, but it really took off [https://www-census-gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca/construction/nrs/pdf/newressales.pdf]early last year, after the Fed cut interest rates to near-zero and began buying government-backed debt to soothe markets at the start of the pandemic. Mortgage rates dropped, and mortgage applications soared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was partly the point as the Fed fought to keep the economy afloat: Home-buying boosts all kinds of spending, on washing machines and drapes and kiddie pools, so it is a key lever for lifting the entire economy. Stoking it helps to revive floundering growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those low interest rates hit just as housing was entering a societal sweet spot. Americans born in 1991, the country’s largest group by birth year, just turned 30. And as Millennials —&nbsp;the nation’s largest generation —&nbsp;were beginning to think about trading in that fifth-floor walk-up for a home of their own, coronavirus lockdowns took hold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suddenly, having more space became paramount. For some, several rounds of government stimulus checks made down payments seem more workable. For others, remote work opened the door to new home markets and possibilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reina and David Pomeroy, 36 and 35, were living in a rental in Santa Clara, Calif., with their children, ages 2 and 7, when the pandemic hit. Buying at California prices seemed like a pipe dream and they wanted to live near family, so they decided to relocate to the Boulder, Colo., area, near Mr. Pomeroy’s brother.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They closed in late July, and they move in a few days. Ms. Pomeroy was able to take her job at a start-up remote, and Mr. Pomeroy is hoping that <span class="companylink">Google</span>, his employer, will allow him to move to its Boulder office. The pair saw between 20 and 30 houses and made — and lost — six offers before finally sealing the deal, over their original budget and $200,000 above the $995,000 asking price on their new 5-bedroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their experience underlines the other key issue driving prices up: “There’s not enough inventory for everyone that’s looking,” said Corey Keach, the Redfin agent who helped the Pomeroys find their home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home supply fell across the residential real estate market following the mid-2000s housing bust, as construction slumped[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/HOUSTDTD1FQ] thanks in part to zoning regulations and tough financing standards. Shortages in lumber, appliances and labor have emerged since the pandemic took hold, making it hard for builders to churn out units fast enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The rapid price appreciation we’re seeing is Econ 101 unfolding in real time,” said Chris Glynn, an economist at Zillow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are early signs that the market might be bringing itself under control. Applications for new mortgages have slowed this year, and existing home inventories have risen somewhat[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/HOSINVUSM495N]. Many housing economists think price increases should moderate later this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while the heady moment in American housing does have some echoes of the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis — borrowing made cheap by the Fed is enabling ambitious buying, and investors are increasingly jumping into[https://www-wsj-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/articles/if-you-sell-a-house-these-days-the-buyer-might-be-a-pension-fund-11617544801] the market — the differences may be even more critical.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners, like the Pomeroys, have been more able to afford the homes they are buying than they were back in 2005 and 2006. People who get mortgages these days tend to have excellent credit scores[https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/interactives/householdcredit/data/pdf/hhdc_2021q1.pdf], unlike that earlier era.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And a big part of the problem in the mid-2000s lay on Wall Street, where banks were slicing and dicing bundles of mortgages into complicated financial structures that ultimately came crashing down. Banks were holding a lot of those inventive securities on their balance sheets, and their implosion caused widespread pain in the financial sector that brought lending — and thus business expansions, hiring and spending — to a screeching halt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks are now much better regulated. But that isn’t to say that no financial stability risks hide in the current boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home price run-up could also help to keep inflation high. The government measures inflation by capturing the costs of what people are regularly consuming — so it counts housing expenses in terms of rents, not home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a skyrocketing housing market is connected to rising rents: it makes it harder for people to make the leap to homeownership, which increases demand for rentals and pushes rents up. That can matter a lot to inflation data, since housing costs tied to rents make up about a third of one key measure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what can the Fed do about any of this? Officials, including Mr. Bullard, have suggested that it might make sense for the Fed to slow its monthly purchases of Treasury debt and mortgage-backed securities soon, and quickly, to avoid giving housing an unneeded boost by keeping mortgages so cheap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Discussions about how and when the Fed will taper off its buying are ongoing, but most economists expect bond-buying to slow late this year or early next. That should nudge mortgage rates higher and slow the booming market a little.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But borrowing costs are likely to remain low by historical standards for years to come. Longer-term interest rates have fallen even as the Fed considers dialing back bond purchases, because investors have grown more glum about the global growth outlook. And the Fed is unlikely to lift its policy interest rate — its more powerful tool — away from rock bottom anytime soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ideally, officials would like to see the economy return to full employment before lifting rates, and most don’t expect that moment to arrive until 2023. They’re unlikely to speed up the plan just to cool off housing. Fed officials have for decades maintained that bubbles are difficult to spot in real time and that monetary policy is the wrong tool to pop them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, your local housing market boom is probably going to be left to its own devices — meaning that while first time home buyers may end up paying more, they will also have an easier time financing it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We felt a little bit more comfortable paying more for the house to lock in low interest rates,” said Mr. Pomeroy, explaining that they could have compromised on amenities they wanted but didn’t.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Interest rates are so low and money is cheap,” he said. “Why not do it?”</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing prices in New York are notoriously high, but if you look carefully, especially with an open mind on location, you can find something affordable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pandemic upended New York City’s real estate market, and even as prices and inventory start to normalize, one thing remains clear: You still get a lot less here than you would almost anywhere else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But your money may go farther than you think. Despite the buzz about big-ticket penthouses owned by billionaires, the city also has hundreds of properties that can be attained without Bezos-level wealth. The available number of these more modestly sized apartments has grown since the pandemic, as demand shifted toward larger units that can more easily accommodate working from home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To score one, though, you might have to compromise. Lower-cost units are often tiny. New developments are generally off the table, since they tend to be high end. And co-ops, rather than condos, are more likely to have these units, though discounted co-ops can have strings attached like steep fees. Also, boroughs outside Manhattan are more likely to have neighborhoods that are awash in homes within reach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There is a mind-set out there that, ‘There’s no way I could buy something in New York,’” said Eirik Gislason, an agent with Brown Harris Stevens who is marketing a studio in Jackson Heights, Queens, for $318,500. “But that’s because there’s not a whole lot of press about these kinds of apartments.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What’s reasonable in terms of price is, of course, in the eye of the beholder. But assuming a budget of $350,000 — the current national median home price, according to the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> — the five boroughs have nearly 2,000 suitable properties, according to a review of listings in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The search excluded official “affordable” housing, since those homes are set aside for buyers making certain incomes and are often dispensed by lottery. The search also put more emphasis on listings with pictures of interior rooms as opposed to those that relied on a few generic facade shots. (Skimping on photos can be a tip-off about rundown conditions, if the listing is even active at all.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even after paring, the list of low-end homes was long, in part, brokers say, because many buyers are abandoning small apartments for larger ones that can fit a home office, or even two. Studios have also stagnated, because renters who might have sought to buy one have decided to stay in their rentals after being rewarded with free rent by their landlords.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, this spring, the inventory of studios in Manhattan soared by 39 percent compared to the same time in 2020, the biggest increase of any apartment size, according to Jonathan Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel. One-bedrooms had the next biggest increase, at 29 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the price per square foot of studios dropped 25 percent, to $953, said Mr. Miller, while the price per square foot for three-bedrooms was about flat versus a year ago, at $1,743.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Options ran the gamut. They included a three-bedroom with bay views in Corona, Queens, for $235,000; a studio near the Brooklyn Bridge for $330,000; and a gut-renovated one-bedroom in the Fordham section of the Bronx for $230,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homes priced around $350,000 are most likely found in the borough’s northern neighborhoods, like Inwood and Washington Heights. But buyers can also find discounts on the Upper East Side, especially in Yorkville. Despite adding a subway line in 2017, Second Avenue’s Q train, the area still seems to offer savings akin to its pre-mass-transit self. A ground-level prewar studio at 215 East 89th Street, No. A[https://www.corcoran.com/nyc-real-estate/for-sale/upper-east-side/215-east-89th-street-a-manhattan-ny-10128/20960736], for instance, is listed at $335,000, down from $340,000 in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Tudor City, the enclave straddling East 42nd Street near Grand Central Terminal, had more than two dozen apartments listed under $350,000 in July. Among them was a studio at 5 Tudor City Place, No. 1103[https://streeteasy.com/building/5-tudor-city-place-new_york/1103], at $299,000. Located in prewar Windsor Tower, a Tudor-style building with a medieval-themed lobby, the apartment comes with hardwood floors, a beamed ceiling and Murphy bed, plus space for a dining table. “People are always trying to figure out where to put a desk,” said Michael Torsiello, a salesman with Keller Williams NYC. Still, casement windows offer unfettered views of the United Nations Secretariat tower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even a berth on Billionaires’ Row can be had, courtesy of Carnegie Tower, a 317-unit postwar co-op at 100 West 57th Street. In mid-July, there were 13 apartments for sale for less than $350,000, including No. 11F[https://streeteasy.com/building/carnegie-house/11f], a 650-square-foot studio with a walled-off sleeping alcove for $150,000. The price is so low because Carnegie Tower sits on leased land, with shareholders on the hook for that land’s rent, which translates into monthly bills that are relatively steep. The studio has monthly maintenance of $1,600 and lists a monthly assessment of $250 that runs into 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I get calls all the time about apartments here,” said Joelle Pergolotti, an agent who has worked in the building for four decades. But once she explains the land lease, “most buyers don’t even respond.” Still, for a doorman building that allows pieds-à-terre near Central Park, Broadway theaters and <span class="companylink">the Museum of Modern Art</span>, some buyers may be able to overlook the hefty maintenance charges. Of the 13 apartments for sale in late July, eight were already in contract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Queens</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An apartment for $235,000 that has not one, not two, but three bedrooms? It exists, in the neighborhood of Corona, on the top floor of the six-story co-op at 112-30 Northern Boulevard, No. 6D[https://streeteasy.com/building/112_30-northern-boulevard-corona/6d].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cars whoosh down Northern Boulevard, and stores are a bit of a walk. But gleaming wood floors, a sunny windowed kitchen and sweeping views of Flushing Bay and La Guardia Airport add a sense of respite from the surroundings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The non-doorman elevator building is part of the Dorie Miller Cooperative — named for an African-American hero of the 1941 Pearl Harbor attack. The red brick six-building complex made history by being racially integrated when it opened in 1953, but it attracted some unwanted attention in recent years when the co-op nearly defaulted on its mortgage over financial mismanagement. Since then, the complex has hired a new operator, elected a new board and raised maintenance fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The building is really keeping on top of things now,” said Abigail Herrera, the Keller Williams agent who is listing No. 6D, which comes with a monthly maintenance bill of $1,267.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Ditmars-Steinway neighborhood, money woes have also plagued Acropolis Gardens, a full-block complex featuring 16 buildings around a long courtyard. In 2018, shareholders, facing foreclosure after checks bounced, revolted and sued their manager, Metropolitan Pacific Properties, alleging tens of millions in missing funds, in a case still winding its way through the courts. “But things are trying to get back in order,” said Iryna Ferenets, an associate broker with Compass who is listing 21-58 35th Street, No. 1C[https://streeteasy.com/building/21_58-35-street-astoria/1c], a one-bedroom, for $260,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the unit, which has exposed brick walls, granite counters and a breakfast bar, first hit the market in 2017, before the shareholder suit, the seller was asking $335,000, or 29 percent more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though the building, located between Ditmars Avenue and 21st Boulevard, is now under different management, banks are still skittish about lending there, which is why buyers need to bring cash, Ms. Ferenets said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A more universal challenge may be convincing renters to become buyers. “The first-time home buyer demographic is waiting on the sidelines,” said Mr. Gislason, the broker with the Jackson Heights studio, who also works as a leasing agent. “The rental market is just so competitive right now,” with multiple months of free rent on top of double-digit discounts, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That softness has forced him to lower the price of his alcove studio, 37-31 73rd Street, No. 4H[https://www.bhsusa.com/queens/37--31-73rd-street-4h/coop/20673442], twice since March, from $349,000 to $318,500. “But I think the value will come back in a year,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bronx</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While new condos may be out of reach for bargain hunters, recently refurbished co-ops can be a viable alternative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Origin North portfolio, located across nine co-ops in the Bronx and Upper Manhattan, offers gut-rehabbed apartments that could be mistaken for new development. No. 3I at 2420 Morris Avenue[https://www.corcoran.com/nyc-real-estate/for-sale/fordham/2420-morris-avenue-3i-bronx-ny-10468/21164015], a one-bedroom unit in a yellow-brick 1950s building in the Fordham section, for instance, features baseboard molding, quartz counters and stainless-steel appliances for $230,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Origin North, which offers financing programs that let buyers put down as little as three percent of the purchase price, is from Glacier Equities, a firm that has specialized in co-ops since the 1980s. Last fall, Glacier bought unsold sponsor units in nine co-op buildings, which was the equivalent of 255 apartments, 218 of which were not rent-regulated. Tenants were not evicted but left as their leases expired, said Myles Horn, Glacier’s managing member, and some tenants bought their apartments at a special discount of 40 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Riverdale, among the Bronx’s most coveted addresses, had about 150 eligible listings, including dozens in Spuyten Duyvil, which nuzzles Manhattan’s northern tip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Certain buildings there seem to be full of them, like River Point Towers, at 555 Kappock Street, a 412-unit tower, which, along with several mid-20th-century co-ops in the area, is perched on a cliff. Of the 33 apartments on the market in late July, according to StreetEasy.com, 23 were for $350,000 or less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     No. 20U[https://www.bhsusa.com/bronx/spuyten-duyvil/555-kappock-street/coop/20938685], a one-bedroom with marble counters in its galley kitchen, a distinct dining area and wide views of city blocks to the east, was $239,000, down from a price of $259,000 last fall. And its monthly maintenance bill of $1,002 comes with use of one of River Point’s most popular amenities: a heated outdoor pool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brooklyn</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the architecturally rich, near-to-Manhattan Brooklyn neighborhoods have prices competitive with Manhattan neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there may be workarounds, like Concord Village, a seven-building complex along Adams Street, near the Brooklyn Bridge and close to Brooklyn Heights. The monolithic red brick co-op, which began life in the urban renewal era as a rental, offers apartments like 225 Adams Street, No. 10B[https://www.corcoran.com/nyc-real-estate/for-sale/brooklyn-heights/225-adams-street-10b-brooklyn-ny-11201/6073439], a studio with a windowed kitchen and a walled-in sleeping area for $330,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Far more options, though, exist in neighborhoods further south, like Sheepshead Bay, where subway access is limited and cars are common. A one-bedroom prewar co-op at 2241 Plumb First Street, No. 5K[https://streeteasy.com/building/2241-plumb-1-street-sheepshead_bay/5k?featured=1], on the border with Gerristen Beach, was listed for $199,000 in July, with sofas, wardrobes and tables included.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When an apartment in this price range pops up in a premier neighborhood, it may be wise to look the gift listing in the mouth. Consider 300 Eighth Avenue, in Park Slope, a co-op comprised totally of studios where units routinely trade for around $250,000. The reason? Three decades after the building converted from a rental into a co-op, fewer than half of its 94 units, or 45, have sold, brokers say, which means it still has not hit the key 50 percent threshold preferred by lenders. Buildings below that threshold, with many occupants who are renters, are too transient, the thinking goes, putting the building’s upkeep at risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the apartments in the Gothic-accented 1920 building for sale last month was a sponsor unit with inlaid floors and original molding, No. 2L[https://streeteasy.com/building/300-8-avenue-brooklyn/sale/1546801], asking $265,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It would be cheaper to buy this and pay the maintenance than it would be to rent it,” said Hal Lehrman, the principal broker of Brooklyn Properties, who has sold sponsor units in the building since the 1990s. “And there is nothing else available in the neighborhood like this. Period.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides, Mr. Lehrman added, with the sale of just three more sponsor units — which is expected to happen this year — the co-op will finally cross the halfway mark, likely sending values skyward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Staten Island</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For single-family houses, the more suburban streets of Staten Island offer options under $350,000 that are attached on one side, or both, though some can seem more like a tear-down than a place to live.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To wit: 166 Roma Avenue[https://streeteasy.com/sale/1489030], a three-bedroom in New Dorp Beach that was slammed by Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and does not appear to have been inhabited since then, was on the market in July for $229,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Staten Island does also offer scattered condos and co-ops with prices far lower than their Manhattan counterparts. For example, a one-bedroom condo in a postwar red brick building at 830 Howard Avenue, No. 2A[https://listings.gatewayarmsrealty.com/idx/details/listing/b042/1145901/830-Howard-Avenue-2a], in the Grymes Hill neighborhood, was listed at $339,900. Its 830 square feet include a dining area, white appliances and wall-to-wall carpeting. The unit, which also comes with a deeded parking space, is near the leafy campus of <span class="companylink">Wagner College</span> and express buses to Brooklyn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In comparison, the median sales price of a condo in Manhattan this spring, according to the firm <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>, was $995,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’re the ‘Borough of Parks,’ and you’re going to get much more of a non-city-type life here,” said Christopher Long, an associate broker with Gateway Arms Realty. Staten Island is also an area that has seen its small apartments lag at the expense of single-family homes, Mr. Long added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Houses here have been selling in a week, just like anywhere else,” Mr. Long said. “But the condos have been a soft spot. No doubt about it.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> 
                        tiptoed ever so slightly[https://www-federalreserve-gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca/newsevents/calendar.htm] toward reducing its efforts to pump liquidity into the financial system. It did so through brief references that might best be characterized as beginning to talk about talking about tapering its vast bond purchases that stimulate the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, the coronavirus has reared its ugly head again[https://www-nytimes-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/2021/07/27/health/coronavirus-vaccination-hesitancy-delta.html]. But in the meantime, the government just announced that economic output grew at an annualized rate of 6.5 percent in the second quarter of this year, housing prices are soaring[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/27/home-prices-broke-records-in-may-according-to-sp-case-shiller.html], a robust 850,000 jobs were added in June[https://www-nytimes-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/2021/07/02/business/economy/june-2021-jobs-report.html#:~:text=Charting%20the%20Recovery-,U.S.%20Added%20850%2C000%20Jobs%20in%20June%2C%20and%20Wages%20Rose,promising%20signal%20about%20the%20recovery.], and American consumers, overall, are emerging from lockdown with trillions in savings to spend on things such as vacations, home improvements and new cars. Meanwhile, the Fed not only has been keeping short-term interest rates near zero[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS] but also is buying at least $120 billion a month[https://www-federalreserve-gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20210728a1.pdf] of debt securities; this has the effect of suppressing long-term interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of that winds up shoveling more money into an economy that likely already suffers from too much money, not too little, raising the specter of overheating and accelerating inflation[https://www-nytimes-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/2021/07/17/business/dealbook/inflation-questions-experts.html]. The Fed’s stance toward housing is particularly inexplicable. Of that monthly $120 billion, the Fed is purchasing $40 billion of mortgage securities, even with house prices escalating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That helps push down mortgage rates. This, in turn, makes purchasing a house more affordable (good) but also pushes home values up, making it tough for buyers (bad). The central bank doesn’t believe the spike in home prices should be principally blamed on the Fed, as its chairman, Jerome Powell, argued[https://www.c-span.org/video/?513257-1/fed-chair-inflation-remain-elevated-months-ahead-moderating] in congressional testimony recently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for its broader efforts to counter the pandemic-related downturn, the Fed has embraced today’s Washington mantra that we moved too slowly and did too little to combat the 2008 recession, so it is better to err in the other direction this time around. But the Fed is also trying to avoid repeating history. In 2013, as we were emerging from the global financial crisis, the central bank began to debate reducing its bond-buying program, known as quantitative easing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Powell was a Federal Reserve governor at the time and an early advocate of trimming the purchases[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-2013-timeline/key-events-for-the-fed-in-2013-the-year-of-the-taper-tantrum-idUSKCN1P52A8]. At a congressional hearing[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-2013-timeline/key-events-for-the-fed-in-2013-the-year-of-the-taper-tantrum-idUSKCN1P52A8] that May, the chairman at the time, Ben Bernanke, mentioned the possibility of tapering. Bond and mortgage yields promptly shot up[https://www-nytimes-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/2019/01/11/us/politics/federal-reserve-jerome-powell.html], stock prices fell, and in the ensuing months, financial conditions tightened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With 2013 still fresh in Fed officials’ minds, the central bank has been cautious to a fault about stepping out of the bond market. Wednesday’s statement merely said the central bank “will continue to assess progress in coming meetings.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Fed should stop with the anodyne statements and do something. The latest inflation reports have been worse than expected[https://mobile.twitter.com/SteveRattner/status/1414961845367156739]. And a recent consumer survey[https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/sce#/] showed that from May to June, Americans’ expectations for the annual inflation rate jumped 0.8 percentage points, to 4.8 percent. Across the economy, a record nine million jobs are available[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/JTSJOL]. Shortages[https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-manufacturing-sector-picks-up-may-work-backlogs-rising-ism-2021-06-01/] of both raw materials and finished goods are popping up with worrisome frequency. Amid all this, a bipartisan group in Congress is working away on even more spending[https://www-nytimes-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/2021/07/28/us/politics/infrastructure-deal-biden.html] directed toward infrastructure. (And House Democrats are working on even more social spending.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s not time yet to raise interest rates. But let’s at least stop pouring $120 billion a month into the financial markets. By shoveling more money into the system, this quantitative easing encourages more risk taking. For example, yields on high yield debt (known as junk bonds) are at record lows[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/14/the-junk-bond-market-is-on-fire-this-year-as-yields-hit-a-record-low.html#:~:text=Most%20recently%2C%20the%20junk%20bond,the%20yield%20was%20at%209.2%25.].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, the bond market — the ultimate distillation of investor sentiments — has a different view. It suggests that average annual inflation over the next decade[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T10YIE] will be 2.4 percent, modestly above the Fed’s target of 2 percent[https://www-federalreserve-gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca/faqs/economy_14400.htm]. I’m not so sure: Inflation isn’t likely to accelerate into the double digits, as it did four decades ago. But even a sustained rise above the Fed’s long-term target of a 2 percent average could force the central bank to raise interest rates, which would slow the economy and put downward pressure on financial markets. (A version of that occurred in 1994[https://www-federalreserve-gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca/econresdata/notes/feds-notes/2015/effects-of-fomc-communications-before-policy-tightening-in-1994-and-2004-20150924.html].) Doubtless, Mr. Powell, whose term as Fed chairman expires in February[https://www-nytimes-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/2021/01/04/business/jerome-powells-future-as-chair-of-the-fed-could-be-affected-by-its-pandemic-response.html], doesn’t want that, either.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But we need to return to a more normal monetary policy. While I’m always hesitant to predict financial markets, I think investors would accept more restrained policies from the Fed with relative calm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Powell, for now, appears unwilling to take that chance. As he said at his news conference Wednesday, “I’ve given you what I can give you.”</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just 40 miles from Midtown, the Morris County township offers striking scenery, wilderness trails and housing that’s ‘great value for your money.’</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Nina and Rob Lifshey moved to Randolph, N.J., in 2019, they were looking for good schools and a reasonable commute to their jobs — hers as a college-admissions officer in Mahwah, his as a telecommunications product manager in Basking Ridge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It wasn’t until after they bought their four-bedroom colonial-style house for $535,000 that “I happened to discover the trails,” said Ms. Lifshey, 37, referring to the 16 miles of paths that wind through the woods and parks of this Morris County township.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a marathoner, Ms. Lifshey runs the trails; Mr. Lifshey, also 37, and the couple’s three children, ages 4 to 12, enjoying walking them with their dog. “We’re an active family,” Ms. Lifshey said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trail system, which dates to the 1990s and was created for about $1.5 million, laces through Randolph’s landscape of hills, ridges, ravines, streams and woods — striking scenery that makes it “a true New Jersey hidden gem,” said Danielle Hilliker, a real estate agent with Kienlen Lattmann Sotheby’s International Realty, in neighboring Mendham.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many house hunters from outside the area start their searches in higher-profile places, like Morristown, before discovering Randolph, where prices trend a bit lower. “As a first-time buyer or maybe a family with young kids, affordability is a little easier in Randolph,” Ms. Hilliker said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s great value for your money,” said Rick Nogueira, 50, a pharmaceutical account executive who moved to the township in 2019 from nearby Long Valley. “We got two acres of property for under $700,000.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nogueira and his wife, Stephanie Duarte, 40, a hospital administrator, paid $629,000 for their colonial-style home. The couple, who have a 12-year-old son and a baby daughter, appreciate Randolph for its ethnic mix of residents, which is valuable for the children. “The more diversity, the less unconscious bias,” said Mr. Nogueira, who, like his wife, is the child of Portuguese immigrants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brian Noonan, 54, and Mayumi Miguel, 41, veteran Broadway performers, began their house hunt in Morristown and Mendham in about 2014, when they were living in Passaic. The couple were looking for a place with good schools and lots of families with young children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When they found Randolph, “we drove through town and looked at each other and kept nodding our heads,” said Mr. Noonan, who has appeared in “The Phantom of the Opera” and now runs an entertainment company that manages tribute acts, including The Jersey Tenors. He also recently became a real estate agent for Keller Williams.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It blew our minds, how beautiful it was,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple, who now have three young children, paid $463,000 for a ranch house in 2014, and are happy with the schools and the sense of community, Mr. Noonan said: “People look out for each other.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What You’ll Find</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Randolph’s housing market is dominated by single-family homes. Tucked among the winding roads and tall trees, you’ll find subdivisions in a mix of suburban styles: Cape Cods, split-levels, ranches and colonials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Douglas Tucker, a real estate agent with Compass, in Short Hills, said that home construction accelerated in Randolph in the 1970s and 1980s, as communities closer to New York City became built-out and developers pushed west.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Randolph also has several historic neighborhoods, including Ironia, where iron ore was mined during the 19th century, and Millbrook, a narrow valley where early Quaker settlers operated mills powered by a stream in the early 1800s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What You’ll Pay</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices and sales volume have surged in Randolph over the past year, as the pandemic pushed home buyers out of densely populated areas and into suburban and exurban markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the Garden State Multiple Listing Service, 409 homes sold in Randolph in the 12 months ending June 24, for a median price of $562,500; during the preceding 12 months, 308 homes sold for a median of $505,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower-priced houses have always sold quickly in Randolph, Ms. Hilliker said, but during the pandemic, homes at the higher end of the market have sold fast too, often with multiple offers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of sales has dramatically reduced inventory from prepandemic levels, said Marlene Ginsberg, an agent with Coldwell Banker, in Chester. As of late July, there were 41 homes on the market in Randolph — compared with 136 on the same day in 2019 — from a two-bedroom ranch listed for $300,000, to a four-bedroom colonial-style house listed for $1.575 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Vibe</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residents savor the natural pleasures of parks, trails, farmers’ markets and swimming at Randolph Park Beach or, if they belong to the Shongum Lake Property Owners Association, at Shongum Lake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Walking to shops and restaurants, however, isn’t part of everyday life, as Randolph lacks a walkable downtown. For that experience, residents travel to Morristown or Denville[https://www-nytimes-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/2021/05/26/realestate/denville-nj-lakefront-living-with-an-eclectic-downtown.html].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are scattered businesses along Sussex Turnpike in the Mount Freedom neighborhood, and the township has rezoned the area to allow mixed-use commercial and residential development. While several developers have expressed interest, no plans have been approved yet, said Stephen Mountain, the township manager, though he said he expects some development to happen in the next year or two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the business activity occurs along busy Route 10, which runs east-west through the northern part of the township, and includes popular establishments like the Randolph Diner, Mr. Crabby’s Craft Kitchen &amp; Bar and Black River Barn, a sports bar and family restaurant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Schools</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Randolph Township School District serves about 4,500 students in six schools: four elementary schools, one middle school for sixth through eighth grades, and Randolph High School, which enrolls about 1,570 students in ninth through 12th grades. The student population in the district is about 66 percent white, 16 percent Hispanic, 14 percent Asian and 3 percent Black.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average SAT scores in the 2019-20 school year were 593 in English language arts and 589 in math, compared with statewide averages of 536 in each. About 93 percent of the class of 2019 enrolled in college or other postsecondary education.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Randolph is also home to Gottesman RTW Academy, a Jewish day school serving children from infancy through eighth grade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">County College of Morris, a public community college serving about 7,000 students, is also in Randolph.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commute</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Randolph is about 40 miles west of Times Square. It is not on a train line, so commuters to New York City drive to Denville or Morristown to take <span class="companylink">New Jersey Transit</span>’s Morris and Essex line. The trip from Morristown takes a little over an hour and costs $14 one way or $393 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Driving to Midtown Manhattan takes about an hour, depending on traffic. Randolph is near Interstate 287 and Interstate 80, which put surrounding counties in New Jersey and New York within commuting range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The History</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the Catskills became the borscht belt, Randolph was “the ‘Dirty Dancing’ of New Jersey,” said Gail M. Hari, the township historian. Beginning in the early 20th century, entrepreneurs opened hotels and bungalow colonies serving a largely Jewish clientele escaping the summer heat in New York City and Newark. In their heyday, from the 1930s to the 1960s, the hotels featured performers like Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby and Milton Berle. In the 1940s, vacationers could catch a bus near Times Square for the trip to Randolph (which cost $1.75 round trip). As highways and cheaper airfare allowed city dwellers to venture farther afield, the vacation scene faded. But traces remain: A building that was part of the 175-room Saltz Hotel complex is now home to Rosie’s Trattoria, a local favorite.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of New Homes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Declined 6.6% in June</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes fell for a third straight month in June, dropping by 6.6 percent to the lowest level in more than a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The June sales decline left sales at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 676,000, the Commerce Department reported Monday. That followed a 7.7 percent sales decline in May and a 10.1 percent fall in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace last month was down 19.4 percent from a year ago and the slowest since April 2020. Housing has been a standout performer since the economy began emerging from the steep-but-short pandemic recession in April last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of a new home sold in June was $361,800, up 6.1 percent from a year ago, but down 5 percent from May, suggesting the surge in prices may be slowing a bit as builders increase inventories. The number of new homes for sale at the end of June increased to 353,000, up 7 percent from May. ASSOCIATED PRESS</p>

</div><div class="author">By Steven Kurutz </div><div>1974 words</div><div>23 July 2021</div><div>05:00</div><div>NYTimes.com Feed</div><div>NYTFEED</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2021. The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tired of sky high prices and losing out in bidding wars, some buyers are giving up and putting their house hunt on hold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first house was in Midvale, Utah — a three-bedroom, just over 2,100 square feet, listed for $479,000. Rob Ettaro and his girlfriend, Kaliana Veros, who had moved from western New York to Salt Lake City, drawn by career opportunities and the stunning scenery of the Wasatch Range, decided to make an offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This was back in the wintertime, when the young couple had a modest wish list that included room for family to visit. Their hearts still raced at the idea of being homeowners. Mr. Ettaro and Ms. Veros offered $6,000 over the asking price. The house sold for $60,000 over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wised up, on the next house they offered $60,000 over list and waived the inspection. There were 54 offers. They weren’t even close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On it went through the spring, their mounting frustration told in the numbers: 70 house tours; 14 offers made; not one accepted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Here’s another one,” said Mr. Ettaro, reading from the detailed spreadsheet he keeps. “We did $35,000 over asking and they ghosted us. No repairs. As is. They just never answered us.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, after five months, Mr. Ettaro, 30, and Ms. Veros, 26, had had enough — they stopped looking. “Just the mental energy we were expending going to see these houses and trying to envision ourselves in them and it not working out again and again and again,” Ms. Veros said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ettaro added, “We’re literally giving them everything we can, and that’s still not good enough. We were feeling really burned out.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates may be historically low, but so is home buyer morale these days. Last month, the Fannie Mae Home Purchase Sentiment Index[https://www.housingwire.com/articles/fannie-mae-sellers-still-thriving-as-home-prices-stay-high/] showed that 64 percent of people believe now is a bad time to buy, up from 56 percent the month prior. Stratospheric prices, brutal bidding wars and record low inventory have conspired to make many prospective home buyers frustrated and fatigued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And some are calling off their search, for reasons that range from an inability to compete financially, to an unwillingness to waive contingencies like an inspection, to a belief the market will cool in time. Home sales have dropped for four months straight[https://www.forbes.com/sites/graisondangor/2021/06/22/home-sales-fall-four-months-straight-while-prices-hit-new-record/?sh=1190438927f5], even as prices have hit record highs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     Mark Boyland[https://www-google-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/search?q=Mark+Boyland%2C+a+realtor+with+Keller+Williams+&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk02nlEvzWC7imYYESAH5T-CdncyqOQ%3A1625758742560&amp;source=hp&amp;ei=FhznYLC6F8fM_Abgq5_4Aw&amp;iflsig=AINFCbYAAAAAYOcqJnKEY9CnNjfG8uihoYTEjQrZWN4A&amp;oq=Mark+Boyland%2C+a+realtor+with+Keller+Williams+&amp;gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyBAgjECdQTlhOYPECaABwAHgAgAGDAYgBgwGSAQMwLjGYAQCgAQKgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6&amp;sclient=gws-wiz&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiwndKi59PxAhVHJt8KHeDVBz8Q4dUDCAk&amp;uact=5], a realtor with Keller Williams in Bedford, N.Y., is noticing “some buyer fatigue out there,” he said. “If you’ve lost out on four or five multiple offer situations, you say: ‘Maybe we should wait until things cool off.’ ”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A real estate market like the current one may be a boon to sellers, but it is emotionally exhausting for would-be buyers. “Every time you’re putting an offer on a house, you’ve effectively fallen in love,” Mr. Boyland said. “And now you’re getting your heart broken. Over and over and over again.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     Thomas Brown is co-founder of the Agency Texas[https://theagencytexas.com/team], a brokerage that serves San Antonio, Houston and the Austin metro area, where home prices were up 43.9 percent year-over-year in April, the biggest jump among the country’s largest 85 metros, according to a report by Redfin[https://austin.culturemap.com/news/real-estate/05-21-21-new-report-unlocks-shocking-stat-about-austins-hot-housing-market/]. Not surprisingly, “there’s a lot of people pausing their searches right now,” Mr. Brown said. “The market is starting to stabilize. Not normalize. Stabilize.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That stabilization is happening, in Mr. Brown’s view, because “there’s just going to be less buyers.” Austin’s rental market is heating up for the same reason. “People are going, ‘I can’t buy the house. I’m going to rent for a year.’”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greg and Daphne Decoteau are renting in Boise, Idaho, though not by choice. In 2019, the couple, empty nesters in their 60s, moved from California’s Napa Valley to Boise to live out their retirement years, drawn by the lower cost of living and active lifestyle. Acting prudently, they visited the area in all four seasons before moving and rented before committing to a home purchase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then the pandemic hit, pulling their attention away from house hunting. By the time the Decoteaus started looking again last December, the local market, already hot, had taken off like a rocket.[https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/07/18/idaho-housing-market/] They waited and watched, “expecting some sanity to creep in,” as Mr. Decoteau put it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, he said, “it just got worse and worse and worse. Now it’s at the point of absurdity. A $400,000 house a year ago is selling for $650,000.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A retired technology hardware salesman, Mr. Decoteau had a real estate license in college and his wife is a former broker. They consider themselves financially astute. They have bought and sold several homes over the course of their marriage. Finding themselves in limbo, they’re now reduced to living in a 1,000-square-foot rental with most of their belongings in storage. They, too, have stopped looking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Frankly, we don’t have the resources to play that game,” Mr. Decoteau said. “We’re past our prime earning years. It’s less a question of appetite than our financial reality. I wake up every morning and kick myself for not having seen this coming.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But how could anyone have predicted the irrationality of this housing market? Candice Smith, a Redfin agent[https://www.hgar.com/member/candice-smith] who covers Westchester and Rockland counties, north of New York City, is still working with buyers who started looking in February. “This market you’re going to be in it for the long haul,” Ms. Smith said. “The average person would be tired if you put in 15, 20 offers and are getting outbid by the competition.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even under normal conditions, the buyer-broker relationship has aspects of a therapy session, with buyers projecting their hopes and dreams on a house and agents trying to translate and temper those desires. These feelings only become heightened when large sums of money are involved. But brokers are doing extra hand-holding these days as buyers get their hopes crushed and lose faith.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“After every loss you have to keep encouraging them,” Ms. Smith said. “I have a buyer right now who said they’re going to take a break. I advised them to take the emotion out of it. What I do is re-strategize. I’m walking them back through the process of why they lost, talking about the appraisal strategy.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     Jennifer Louis[https://welcometoboiseandbeyond.com/contact/], an agent in Boise who has been working with the Decoteaus, said that she makes sure her buyers understand what it takes to find a house in a “Hunger Games”-like environment. And what does it take?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You have to make a decision literally sometimes in an hour,” Ms. Louis said. “Sometimes not even. There’s a line out the door. You have 15 minutes to see the house and make a decision.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She went on, “I need people who are reactive and available. I’ve had others where they don’t get back to me for a day or two. Well, it’s gone. You have to take time off work. You have to fly into town or do whatever it takes.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For any buyer who wants to seriously compete, the house hunt has become an all-consuming second job. That level of engagement, often without reward, is also leading to buyer burnout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ettaro and Ms. Veros were seeing between five and 10 houses a week, spending hours scanning listings online and living on takeout food as they drove to open houses in farther-out areas they hoped to better afford. Instead of hiking or mountain biking on weekends, activities they both love to do, they were touring houses they were all but assured not to get, and arguing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We were having arguments over whether, ‘Hey, do you want to look at five houses today?’ ” Mr. Ettaro said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Said Ms. Veros: “We came to the conclusion this is clearly affecting us. We need to step back and relax for a minute and see how things go.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Faced with such fierce competition, buyers tend to fall into two camps — those who become defiant and determined to land a house, and those, like Nick Sauro, who would rather check out of the mania.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sauro, 41, and his wife, Ilone, 39, own a starter home in New Rochelle, N.Y., where they live with their 18-month-old twin boys, 8-year-old daughter and Ms. Sauro’s mother. They need more space, desperately. They have a budget of $750,000 to upgrade. But when they started looking this spring, “there was just nothing out there,” Mr. Sauro said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Every house we liked was this crazy bidding war,” he said. “Then these other houses just aren’t that great. They need a lot of work. You walk out. You’re kind of disgusted. We can’t move to a fixer-upper. And that’s all that’s out there.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As summer came, the Sauros decided to enjoy the weather. Their current house may be cramped, but they own it, and buying it eight years ago was relatively stress free. “If you’ve been through the process,” Mr. Sauro said, “why would you partake in this craziness?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For first-time buyers, however, it can feel like they may never get beyond the frenzy and become homeowners. And in markets where prices have increased by 25 percent or more in a matter of months, a sense of hopelessness isn’t an overreaction to losing a few bidding wars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“For the young ones, it’s heartbreaking, because if they don’t already have a house or a family that’s going to finance them, it’s getting almost impossible to find them a home,” said Ms. Louis, the agent in Boise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ettaro and Ms. Veros have made the decision to continue renting in Salt Lake City, wait it out and hope they can eventually buy. “Maybe it will level out,” Mr. Ettaro said. “Maybe we won’t have to go $70,000 over asking and get beat out by 50 other offers.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Decoteaus, too, at a different stage in life but facing the same dilemma, are sitting on the sidelines, feeling not so much burned out as plain burned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’re sitting here trying to figure out what the hell we’re going to do,” Mr. Decoteau said. “We’re not sure we’re going to be able to stay here. We’re just about priced out.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On their list of places to retire to, the Decoteaus also included Asheville, N.C., Medford, Ore., and Colorado Springs, Colo. Perhaps one of those communities is still affordable?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“My suspicion is those places are sucked up in this insanity also,” Mr. Decoteau said. “Our other option is to stay in this little apartment until we go crazy.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">UNEMPLOYMENT</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New State Jobless Claims Increased Last Week</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initial claims for state jobless benefits rose last week, the Labor Department reported Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weekly figure, before seasonal adjustments, was about 406,000, an increase of 14,000 from the previous week. New claims for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, a federally funded program for jobless freelancers, gig workers and others who do not ordinarily qualify for state benefits, totaled 110,000, up about 14,000 from the week before. The figures are not seasonally adjusted. (On a seasonally adjusted basis, state claims totaled 419,000, an increase of 51,000.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New state claims remain high by historical standards but are one-third the level recorded in early January. The benefit filings, something of a proxy for layoffs, have receded as businesses return to fuller operations, particularly in hard-hit industries like leisure and hospitality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 20 states have recently discontinued some or all federal pandemic unemployment benefits -- including a $300 supplement to other benefits -- even though they are funded through September. Officials in those states said the payments were keeping people from seeking work. But judges in Maryland and Indiana have blocked the early cutoff, and legal challenges are pending in three other states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A survey of 5,000 adults conducted June 22-25 by Morning Consult found that those whose unemployment benefits were about to expire felt more pressure to find work. But of all those on unemployment insurance, relatively few -- 20 percent of those who had worked full time, and 28 percent of those who had worked part time -- said the benefits were better than their previous work income in meeting basic expenses.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signals Tolerance for Inflation</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> updated its message to financial markets on Thursday, saying it will briefly tolerate some jumps in inflation before policymakers take action to raise interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the first policy announcement since the central bank offered the results of its strategy review this month, which showed that policymakers would allow emergency measures to persist even if inflation temporarily rises above 2 percent. In the review, the bank also said it would use its influence in the bond market to tackle climate change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The central bank's latest forward guidance, published Thursday, was changed to reflect this new strategy. Interest rates will ''remain at their present or lower levels'' until inflation is seen reaching 2 percent ''well ahead'' of the end of the central bank's projection horizon, which is approximately three years, ''and durably'' for the rest of that period. Policymakers will also keep interest rates low until there is evidence that inflation will stabilize at 2 percent ''over the medium term.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This may also imply a transitory period in which inflation is moderately above target,'' the statement said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This leads to the potential for a longer period of low interest rates and bond purchases because the central bank will not be forced to react to temporary bouts of higher inflation. In general, the region has suffered from persistently low inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new guidance has raised the bar for higher interest rates in Europe, Claus Vistesen, an economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a note.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Covid-19 first hit, those of us in the real estate industry predicted a collapse of the housing market. In just the first two months of the pandemic, 22.4 million Americans lost their jobs, while gross domestic product fell at the fastest rate in modern history in the second quarter. Instead, what unfolded was a transformation of the housing market, fueled by what I call ''migration mania.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For employees in many industries, working remotely during the pandemic effectively has untethered them from their physical offices. Historically, but even more so during the pandemic, those with higher-income jobs are the most likely to work from home, <span class="companylink">McKinsey &amp; Company</span> found. As a result, many of them have chosen to move from more expensive areas of the country to lower-cost metros.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This emergence of buyers relocating to lower-cost markets, paired with low interest rates, limited housing supply, investors looking to make money on the housing upswing and home shoppers caught up in the excitement, mean higher home prices. In the existing market, which represents the bulk of total home sales, prices are up 24 percent nationally from prices in May of last year, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this is not an equal-opportunity boom. The housing rebound has been fueled by buyers whose wealth allowed them to win bidding wars often with a high down payment and a bid over asking price. Those living on local incomes, which are often modest compared with those of relocating newcomers, are losing the ability to buy a home as competition grows and prices rise. In the long run, this means some Americans will be able to build wealth in their homes, leaving the rest behind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the onset of the pandemic, buyer confidence crashed. Sales slowed in March 2020, and by May, total transactions were down by 24 percent from the start of the year. Yet May marked the bottom for home sales: Spring 2020 wound up heralding the biggest housing boom in over a decade, helping hundreds of thousands of Americans get back to work. After being cooped up for months, consumers jumped into the market to find their dream house, much to the delight of builders and realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By summer 2020, it became apparent that the demand for housing far exceeded supply, sending prices skyrocketing. In 2019, the median sales price for a home grew 4.9 percent over 2018 levels; by the last six months of 2020, it had jumped to 13.4 percent, according to the realtors' association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soon, wild stories began cropping up from around the country: homes selling for hundreds of thousands of dollars over the asking price, two-year wait lists, realtors holding live auctions, people camping out for days for the chance to buy a new home despite not knowing its price. This frenzy recalls the mid-2000s housing boom -- and that, understandably, has people worried.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But today's market is different. This boom isn't driven by loose credit and speculative lending. In fact, home buyers today are financially sound, with 73 percent of mortgages in the first quarter of this year going to those with a credit score of at least 760, up from 64 percent last year. Beyond good credit scores, buyers today have healthy debt-to-income ratios and wealth thanks to some combination of savings, home equity, investments and generational transfer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, rapidly rising home prices are leaving some potential buyers priced out, possibly forever. Those who cannot afford a sizable down payment or lack a good credit score have been less able to ascend the homeownership ladder -- much less get on it -- a critical part of building wealth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gap between the haves and the have-nots is especially pronounced in places swept up in the relocation frenzy. Phoenix, for instance, had the highest positive net in-migration in the latest data from the <span class="companylink">U.S. Census Bureau</span>. According to Redfin, Phoenix real estate is luring those living in Los Angeles -- and with good reason. Those moving from Southern California to Phoenix can find a like-for-like home for half the price in the new location. The average size of a new home in Phoenix is 2,500 square feet, at an average price of $505,800, according to Zonda; the equivalent home in Los Angeles averages $1.15 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result of the influx, home prices in Phoenix are roughly 20 percent above levels last year compared with just a 3.2 percent rise in local incomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So while Phoenix's relative affordability is allowing shoppers from higher-priced markets to drive up local home prices, it drives out local buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The same trend is playing out in other large and growing markets like Austin, Texas, and Tampa, Fla., but also in smaller markets. Home prices in Salisbury, Md., went from 3 percent growth between May 2019 and May 2020 to 15 percent growth between May 2020 and May 2021. Boise, Idaho, a strong market before the pandemic, grew 11 percent between May 2019 and May 2020 compared with 36 percent between May 2020 and May 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All this is to say: Relocation buyers have and will continue to fundamentally change the housing landscape across the country. The agglomeration of higher-income individuals is likely to be accompanied by a permanent shift to more expensive housing, a problem that will be exacerbated as mortgage rates rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To give local residents at risk of being priced out in these relocation hubs a shot at homeownership, officials should provide incentives for development near public transportation, convert underutilized commercial real estate into housing and spur the construction of more affordable homes via tax incentives. Builders and developers should focus on lower-priced homes. Buyers should be ready to accept a smaller home or more densely populated neighborhood for affordability. And lenders should extend access to mortgages without repeating the loose-lending mistakes of the last housing boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultimately, less-stringent zoning rules, better funding to recruit and train construction workers, and pro-housing policy will help prevent a large number of Americans from being permanently excluded from homeownership.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers' fatigue may have helped stabilize sales figures in May, but brokers expect a renewed frenzy in coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a shift of only one or two degrees, but the red-hot housing market in California is finally starting to cool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the median home price hitting yet another record high in May, year-to-date statewide home sales dipped in the state by 2.7 percent in May. They had been rising steadily since February. And for the first time in 2021, the median number of days that a single-family home was on the market did not drop, but rather held steady at seven, the same number recorded in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Buyers are getting fed up at this point with submitting as many as eight to 12 offers and getting rejected,'' said John Graff, a Los Angeles-based broker and the chief executive of Ashby &amp; Graff Real Estate. ''They're throwing up their hands at this point.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price for a single-family home in California hit $818,260 in May, an uptick of half a percentage point from last month. It's an acceleration with a foot off the gas: In April, when the median price hit $814,010, prices had jumped 7 percent from the previous month to cross the $800,000 threshold for the first time in history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only seven months prior, the median price crossed $700,000 for the first time, and one year ago, in May 2020, the median price for a single-family home in California was $588,070.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My clients are exhausted. They would still love to buy a house but they're not interested in the bidding wars,'' said Kelli Miller, a broker in San Diego. ''I'm still seeing multiple offers, but it's not the frenzy that it was before.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Miller said the downgrade was more noticeable among homes priced below $1 million, noting that it was those homes that would have received a dozen offers or more just a few months ago. They are now receiving ''only'' five or six offers. Much of that has to do with inflated asking prices, which have been propelled upward by a trifecta of record-low supply, increased demand and rock-bottom mortgage rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Most families just are not interested in paying such a marked-up premium,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A May 2021 report from the <span class="companylink">California Association of Realtors</span> noted that the sales of ultraluxury properties played a significant role in May's record-breaking median home price, referring to ''robust demand of higher-priced properties'' and adding that the market share of $1 million home sales in California has increased more than 200 percent from May 2020.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''More million dollar properties were sold in the past couple of months than homes priced below $500,000,'' the report's authors added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California, which remains mired in an affordable housing crisis, saw its population decline last year for the first time in more than a century. And the demographics of its cities and suburbs remain in flux as many residents, particularly young families with children, leave its urban centers for more affordable homes in further-flung spots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cooling was more apparent in the Los Angeles Metro area, where the median home price -- $725,000 -- remained unchanged from last month; along the Central Coast, where the median sales price dipped 2.8 percent in May, and in California's far north, where the median sales price slipped from $367,250 to $365,000. One area that doesn't appear to be slowing, however, is the condo and townhouse market, which in May recorded an increase in median sales price of 3.9 percent, up to $592,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     Jonathan Miller, of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel, compiles the monthly Elliman Report, an in-depth look at sales activity in several key U.S. markets, including California. While he agrees that the frenzy in California is starting to slow, he is quick to dismiss doomsday scenarios of an impending burst bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The lack of inventory is pervasive, and we're seeing buyer fatigue. The market is still quite intense but not at the same level it was earlier in the year,'' Mr. Miller said. ''This doesn't mean that the next step is a downward trend; it only suggests that the incline won't be as steep as it was.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Graff, the broker in Los Angeles, agrees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's been talk in some corners of a bubble and I want to emphasize that's not true. It just comes down to supply and demand,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He dismisses another idea, as well: that the dip recorded in May will last through the summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The market is still very hot,'' he said. ''This might be a slight cooling as buyers and sellers all take a collective pause to breathe, but there's no sign of this abating any time soon.''</p>

                        <span class="companylink">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</span> on Thursday approved a one-month extension of the national moratorium on evictions[https://www-nytimes-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/2021/07/29/us/politics/eviction-moratorium-biden-congress.html], scheduled to expire on June 30, as officials emphasized this will be the final time they will push back the deadline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The moratorium[https://www-nytimes-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/2021/06/29/us/politics/supreme-court-eviction-ban.html], instituted by the agency last September to prevent a wave of evictions spurred by the economic downturn associated with the coronavirus pandemic and extended earlier this year, has significantly limited the economic damage[https://www-nytimes-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/2021/06/16/business/affordable-housing-crisis.html] to renters and sharply reduced eviction filings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Thursday, the C.D.C. director, Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, signed the extension, which goes through July 31, after a week of internal debate at the White House over the issue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local officials and tenants rights groups have warned that phasing out the freeze could touch off a new, if somewhat less severe, eviction crisis than the country faced last year during the height of the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">White House officials agreed and pressed reluctant C.D.C.[https://www-nytimes-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/2021/06/29/us/politics/supreme-court-eviction-ban.html] officials to extend the moratorium, which they see as needed to buy them more time to distribute $21.5 billion in emergency federal housing aid funded by a pandemic relief bill passed this spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Administration officials, speaking on a conference call with reporters on Thursday, unveiled a range of other actions intended to blunt the impact of lifting the moratorium and the lapsing of similar state and local measures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the most significant is a new push by the Justice Department, led by Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta, to coax local housing court judges to slow the pace of evictions by forcing landlords to accept federal money intended to pay back rent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a letter to state court officials, Ms. Gupta urged judges to adopt a general order requiring all landlords to prove they have applied for federal aid before signing off on evictions, while offering federal funding for eviction diversion programs intended to resolve landlord-tenant disputes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other initiatives include a summit on housing affordability and evictions, to be held at the White House later this month; stepped-up coordination with local officials and legal aid organizations to minimize evictions after July 31; and new guidance from the Treasury Department meant to streamline the sluggish disbursement of the $21.5 billion in emergency aid included in the pandemic relief bill in the spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">White House officials, requesting anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the issue publicly, said recently that the one-month extension, while influenced by concerns over a new wave of evictions, was prompted by the lag in vaccination rates in low-income communities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Walensky was initially reluctant to sign the extension, according to a senior administration official involved in the negotiations. She eventually concluded, the official said, a flood of new evictions could lead to greater spread of the virus by displaced tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forty-four House Democrats wrote to Ms. Walensky[https://pressley.house.gov/sites/pressley.house.gov/files/2021-06-22%20Eviction%20Moratorium%20Extension%20Letter%20vF.pdf], on Tuesday, urging them to put off allowing evictions to resume. “By extending the moratorium and incorporating these critical improvements to protect vulnerable renters, we can work to curtail the eviction crisis disproportionately impacting our communities of color,” the lawmakers wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Groups representing private landlords maintain that the health crisis that justified the freeze has ended and that continuing the freeze even for an extra four weeks would be an unwarranted government intrusion in the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The mounting housing affordability crisis is quickly becoming a housing affordability disaster fueled by flawed eviction moratoriums, which leave renters with insurmountable debt and housing providers holding the bag,” said Bob Pinnegar, president of the National Apartment Association, a trade group representing owners of large residential buildings.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The action is one of a number being taken by the administration to blunt the effects of the pandemic and the economic downturn on renters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The Biden administration plans to extend the national moratorium on evictions, scheduled to expire on June 30, by one month to buy more time to distribute billions of dollars in federal pandemic housing aid, according to two officials with knowledge of the situation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The moratorium, instituted by the <span class="companylink">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</span> in September to prevent a wave of evictions spurred by the economic downturn associated with the coronavirus pandemic, has significantly limited the economic damage to renters and sharply reduced eviction filings, researchers say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congressional Democrats, local officials and tenant groups have been warning that the expiration of the moratorium at the end of the month, and the lapsing of similar state and local measures, could lead to a surge in evictions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">President Biden's team decided to extend the moratorium by a month after an internal debate at the White House over the weekend. The step is one of a series of actions that the administration plans to take in the next several weeks, involving several federal agencies, the officials said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other initiatives include a summit on housing affordability and evictions, to be held at the White House later this month; stepped-up coordination with local officials and legal aid organizations to minimize evictions after July 31; and new guidance from the Treasury Department meant to streamline the sluggish disbursement of the $21.5 billion in emergency aid included in the pandemic relief bill in the spring.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forty-four House Democrats wrote to Mr. Biden and the C.D.C. director, Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, on Tuesday, urging them to keep the moratorium in place.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokesman for the C.D.C. did not immediately reply to a request for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many local officials have also pressed to extend the freeze as long as possible, and are bracing for a rise in evictions when the federal moratorium and similar state and city orders expire over the summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, a Democrat, announced on Monday that his state had set aside $5.2 billion from federal aid packages to pay off the back rent of tenants who fell behind during the pandemic, an extraordinary move intended to wipe the slate clean for millions of renters.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spike in demand has exacerbated a shortage in available homes that was already problem before the pandemic. Economists don't expect the dynamics to shift anytime soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of homes in the United States fell for the fourth consecutive month in May as a sharp rise in prices and a shortage of houses for sale led to a slowdown in the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales fell 0.9 percent in May from April, the National Association of Realtors said Tuesday, with the median sales price climbing nearly 24 percent from a year earlier to a record $350,300.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales in May were nearly 45 percent higher than they were a year ago as buyers continue to leave cities in search of more space and better work-from-home scenarios. That spike in demand has exacerbated a shortage in housing supply that was already problem before the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists don't expect the dynamics to shift anytime soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's so many factors with limited supply that it's hard to imagine a huge increase in supply any time soon,'' said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead economist at Oxford Economics. ''The housing market has been suffering for many years from a shortage of homes for sales and that's only gotten worse as the pandemic created a demand for housing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 1.23 million previously owned homes were on the market in May, a 20.6 percent decline from a year ago, the report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Lack of inventory continues to be the overwhelming factor holding back home sales, but falling affordability is simply squeezing some first-time buyers out of the market,'' Lawrence Yun, the Realtor association's chief economist, said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Realtors also cited under-construction and a lack of investment for new homes as some of the chief factors for rising home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soaring demand for vacation homes is also fueling a spike in prices, especially in Florida, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan and North Carolina, the report showed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From January to April, vacation home sales jumped 57.2 percent year-over-year, according to the 2021 Vacation Home Counties Report.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The United States averted the direst predictions about what the pandemic would do to the housing market. An eviction wave never materialized and the share of people behind on mortgages recently returned to its prepandemic level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a comprehensive report on U.S. housing conditions[https://www-nytimes-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/2021/06/16/business/affordable-housing-crisis.html] makes clear that while one crisis is passing, another is growing much worse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like the broader economy, the housing market is split on divergent tracks, according to the annual State of the Nation’s Housing Report[http://www.jchs.harvard.edu/state-nations-housing-2021] released on Wednesday by Harvard’s Joint Center for Housing Studies. While one group of households is rushing to buy homes[https://www-nytimes-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/2021/05/29/business/economy/new-home-building-suburbs.html] with savings built during the pandemic, another is being locked out of ownership as prices march upward. Those who bore the brunt of pandemic job losses remain saddled with debt[https://www-nytimes-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/2021/02/11/us/california-housing-crisis.html] and in danger of losing their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the past year, lower-income tenants have relied heavily on government support to pay their monthly bills. While those measures have helped, the majority of renters still had to borrow or draw on savings to cover bills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With savings tapped out and unemployment benefits set to lapse, the financial damage to low-income households remains severe enough that they will need more support if they’re to recover along with the broader economy, the Harvard report said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Millions of households were financially unscathed coming out of the pandemic,” said Alexander Hermann, senior research analyst at the Joint Center for Housing Studies. “But the pandemic has left millions of others struggling to make their housing payments, especially lower-income households and people of color.”</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lack of inventory across the country helps explain why home prices are through the roof.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, housing prices are up, and yes, there is a shortage of home listings. It's simple supply and demand -- anyone looking to buy a home in the U.S. will tell you it's been a tough year. But as the pandemic has begun to recede, there's been some improvement, according to a report on the April 2021 housing market by Realtor.com: The number of newly listed homes increased by about 33 percent over last April, and by 43 percent in large metropolitan areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's still not nearly enough to meet demand, in part because homes have been selling so quickly. In April, a U.S. home typically sat on the market for 43 days before being bought, whereas a year ago it took about 63 days, and in the three years before that it took about 61 days. As a result, the total inventory of listings in April was still down 53 percent year over year, helping to raise the median list price of U.S. homes to a record $375,000, according to Realtor.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, not every city or region has seen similar buyer behavior. So where did inventory shrink the most, and how did that affect listing prices in those areas?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the 50 largest U.S. metro areas, the decline in April listings over a year was greatest in Austin, Texas, where a 73 percent drop in listings pushed the median listing price up to $515,000, a roughly 41 percent increase. The median home took just 18 days to sell in Austin, second only to Denver (15 days) and Columbus, Ohio (16 days).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of available homes was most stable in San Francisco, falling about 2 percent over the year, and other expensive metro areas followed: San Jose, Calif., New York, Los Angeles and Boston. But prices rose in all of them. In fact, Memphis and Milwaukee were the only metros among the 50 largest where listing prices fell, though only by 4 percent or less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using data from Realtor.com's report, this week's chart focuses on the 20 metros that saw the greatest losses in inventory in April, compared with a year earlier.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Hannah Selinger </div><div>1373 words</div><div>29 May 2021</div><div>21:22</div><div>NYTimes.com Feed</div><div>NYTFEED</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2021. The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Splashing around in your backyard does not require a pool. There are many options that are just as much fun, and much, much less expensive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You could easily call last summer the Year of the Backyard Pool, as the pandemic forced families away from crowded lakes, beaches and community centers. According to the Pool &amp; Hot Tub Alliance, pool sales rose by more than 20 percent in 2020, although many families alternatively turned to water bounce houses, backyard splash pads, Slip ‘N Slides and other water-filled items to stay cool at home. If you’re similarly looking to turn your yard into a water park without the long-term commitment of an actual pool, here’s how to get started.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Know your options.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The world of backyard water entertainment has come a long way from the sprinkler runs of four decades ago. Water enthusiasts can now choose between bounce houses, water tables, elaborate sprinklers, inflatables of all shapes and sizes, splash pads and more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Jaime Maser Berman, 43, a beauty publicist in Westfield, N.J., the pandemic brought a move to the suburbs, as well as a host of water-related toys. Ms. Maser Berman and her family invested in a Slip ‘N Slide and a blowup baby pool, and accepted a hand-me-down water table from one of her sisters. Her backyard water-park project has been a success. “If our backyard was bigger, I’d probably be trying to convince my husband we should have a blowup water bounce house,” she said. (The inflatable houses take up a considerable amount of flat yard space.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thomas Jepsen, 30, of Raleigh, N.C., bought a bounce house for his children mid-pandemic. Mr. Jepsen, chief executive of a company called Passion Plans, which connects home buyers with architects and designers, said that his kids were in need of entertainment. Luckily, Mr. Jepsen said, he had “a pretty big backyard,” and after his children visited a friend with a water bounce house, the family fell in love with it and decided to buy one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Major retailers, like Target, <span class="companylink">Amazon</span> and Wayfair, stock inflatable water bounce houses. They range between $300 and $500, and are suitable for children aged 5 and up. They can also take up about 150 square feet of space and weigh up to 600 pounds when inflated. Slip ‘N Slides, and their off-brand cousins, can be used on ground that is not flat, but they still require ample yard space; they run about 12 to 60 feet in length.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If bounce houses and slides are too large for your yard, the company H20GO! makes other outdoor water toys, like the 6-foot-tall and roughly 4-foot-long caterpillar, an inflatable sprinkler system appropriate for children 2 and older. The company Fat Brain Toys also offers an outdoor water series, with items like a six-foot-tall inflatable unicorn sprinkler and a compact light-show sprinkler that can be attached to any standard hose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Water tables, which range in price from about $50 to well over $100, offer younger kids the opportunity to play in the water without the hassle of a pool. They can be placed either on grass or a patio or a deck, and, once filled, don’t need to be replenished for a few days. The company <span class="companylink">Little Tikes</span> makes sturdy water tables (as well as a new-to-the-market product called the FOAMO Foam Machine, which produces a small mountain of nontoxic foam that can be used outdoors).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flat splash pads lie on the ground and allow young children to play in a shallow disk of water. Lindsay Fargo, 42, of Santa Cruz, Calif., bought a pad for her 2-year-old daughter last year. Ms. Fargo, senior consultant, product growth for Little Bridges, which sells multigenerational activity kits found that the splash pad left “room in the yard for more fun,” but that it was “big enough for a few family members to enjoy together.” She also liked how easy it was to store by tucking it away in the garage or garden shed. The splash pad, she said, was easy to use: connect a garden hose and let it go. “No parental lungs or trips to the hardware store for air pumps required here,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Relatively light and compact and weighing between two and three pounds, splash pads can be used safely by children as young as 2. They’re also a good choice for people who would like to spend a little less (they are available for $50 and up), or who have smaller outdoor areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Know your needs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When purchasing outdoor water toys, consider your budget, space limitations and whether you have flat ground, which is necessary for pads and inflatables. (And make sure you have a long enough hose to reach them.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You’ll also want to consider possible downsides. Splash pads, Ms. Fargo said, can pool particularly cold water, since the water runs continuously from the hose and doesn’t have an opportunity to warm in the sun. But that need not necessarily be a deal-breaker. The temperature, Ms. Fargo said, “may have shortened our playtime a bit, but that made us feel like we wasted less water.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Water usage, as a whole, is a valid consideration, especially when you consider environmental impact. Since water cannot be recycled in many active water toys, the most environmentally friendly option is a water table, which only requires a single fill and not the constant running of the hose. Water tables do have to be replenished every few days, but they still consume less than sprinklers, bounce houses and splash pads. And, since they can be used on hard surfaces, they won’t cause damage to your lawn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inflatables, in particular, can kill grass, said Caitlin Manner, 37, a writer from Panama City, Fla. Last summer, when her sons were 2, 5 and 8, Ms. Manner bought a bounce house with a pool and slide. “It definitely killed off a patch of grass,” Ms. Manner said. “If you leave it any longer than two days, that grass is toast.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Maser Berman also noted that availability may be one significant drawback, and that parents of young children should purchase backup toys this season, before items run out. “My biggest tip is to buy early in the season,” she said. “Your kids will somehow break something.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keep them clean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outdoor water toys are prone to mildew, mold, pollen and animal damage. To keep them looking their best, spray them down regularly with water and deep-clean them when needed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jepsen recommends cleaning bounce houses and other outdoor water toys with a solution of vinegar and dish soap. Make your own solution by combining, in a spray bottle, ¼ cup white vinegar, ½ teaspoon of dish soap, and 2½ cups of water. Spray the cleaner all over the inflatable, wash with clean water and allow it to dry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also suggests deflating and drying bounce houses regularly, advice which can translate to any inflatable water toy. At least once a month — and always before storing — deflate air-filled water toys and allow them to sit in the sun on a dry surface until the exterior water has evaporated. They should then be tightly folded and stored either in the bag that they came in or in a sealed, industrial-strength garbage bag in a dry place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since she doesn’t have a basement, Ms. Manner stores her clean, dried and folded inflatable in a <span class="companylink">Tupperware</span> container on her porch. Some water-toy users, like Ms. Maser Berman, put their items away after each use. “Yes, it’s a pain to schlep in and out, every day,” she said. “But you won’t risk anything getting ruined by weather or animals.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here’s a much-needed cheat sheet for New York City’s mayoral candidates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Politicians out of touch with their constituencies — it’s a recurring theme. While seeking re-election in 1992, President George H.W. Bush expressed incredulity at a common supermarket scanner[https://www-nytimes-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/1992/02/05/us/bush-encounters-the-supermarket-amazed.html?searchResultPosition=1]. Fifteen years later, while campaigning for president in Alabama, Rudolph Giuliani 
                        drastically underestimated[https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna18053711] the cost of a gallon of milk and a loaf of bread.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this month, it happened again[https://www-nytimes-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/2021/05/11/nyregion/median-home-brooklyn-mayor.html] when several New York City mayoral candidates responded to a question posed by The <span class="companylink">New York Times</span> editorial board: Do you know the median sales price for a home in Brooklyn?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many were way off the mark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
                     Shaun Donovan[https://www-nytimes-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/2021/05/10/opinion/shaun-donovan-endorsement-interview.html], housing secretary under President Barack Obama and housing commissioner under Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, guessed $100,000. Ray McGuire[https://www-nytimes-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/2021/05/10/opinion/ray-mcguire-endorsement-interview.html], a former <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> executive and an investment banker, put it at $80,000 to $100,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These answers would have been closer to reality back when Mr. Bush was still serving as vice president under Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. In fact, the median Brooklyn sale price was already triple those estimates in 2003, or about $300,000. Since then it has tripled again to $900,000[https://www.millersamuel.com/press/brooklyns-median-home-price-surges-12-ito-a-record-900000/], even after a post-recession dip between 2009 and 2012. (Among the candidates who answered the Times’s question, only Andrew Yang[https://www-nytimes-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/2021/05/10/opinion/andrew-yang-endorsement-interview.html] guessed correctly. Kathryn Garcia[https://www-nytimes-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/2021/05/10/opinion/kathryn-garcia-endorsement-interview.html], a former sanitation commissioner, came close at $800,000, as did Scott M. Stringer[https://www-nytimes-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/2021/05/10/opinion/scott-stringer-endorsement-interview.html], the city comptroller, who guessed $1 million.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To those who have followed our coverage of New York’s housing market, or to anyone who has hunted for a home in the city in the past decade or two, our apologies — the steep climb of Brooklyn home prices is not news. But for the candidates or others that may need a cheat sheet, this week’s chart shows 18 years of first-quarter median sale prices in the borough, with data provided by Miller Samuel, the appraisal company.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">The North Fork Enjoys A Market's Rising Tide</span>
</div><div class="author">By C. J. Hughes </div><div>1732 words</div><div>16 May 2021</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2021 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A steady stream of buyers intent on finding good deals and open spaces during the pandemic has meant record sales and rising prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices have been climbing on the North Fork for years now, but the market went into overdrive when the pandemic hit, and the impact could be long-term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market, which is usually quiet in the months after Christmas, has instead been bustling this year, as home sales hit numbers not seen since the mid-2000s. Renters, who have been testing the sales market since the start of the pandemic, are still snapping up properties, while longtime weekenders are making the jump to full-time residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether the strong interest is sustainable is unclear. As urban life creaks back to normal, and bosses summon workers back to offices, some North Forkers are packing their bags to return to New York. But for now, a place often overshadowed by the showier Hamptons seems to be reveling in newfound attention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's all very exciting,'' said Angela Oliveri, a 35-year resident whose home-décor shop, Sweet Indulgences, in Greenport, had one of its busiest-ever winters. ''It's been wonderful to see people appreciate our area and realize how unique it is.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Offering 30 miles of farm stands, wineries, pebbly beaches and calm coves nestled between Long Island Sound and Peconic Bay, the North Fork is a less populated and more agricultural version of the South Fork, otherwise known as the Hamptons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Made up of part of the town of Riverhead, and the entire town of Southold -- including the hamlets of Mattituck, Cutchogue, Southold and Orient, and the village of Greenport -- the North Fork is also usually more affordable than the South Fork, with an average home price of about $1 million, about half that of the Hamptons. A short ferry ride from both the North and South Forks, Shelter Island is its own town between Peconic Bay and Gardiners Bay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in recent years, there has been a bit of an evolution. More buyers now view the North Fork not as a consolation prize after being shut out of other enclaves, but as a destination in its own right. And the Covid crisis, according to brokers, business owners and longtime residents, has seemed to only amplify that interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the early months of the pandemic, when low-density vacation areas suddenly seemed all the rage, New Yorkers scurried to the North Fork and snapped up rentals, even if they had never spent much time there before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet many came to like the area and decided to stay, often by buying the properties they had rented after their leases ended, which has fueled record-setting waves in the sales market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between July and September of 2020, after officials lifted restrictions on house showings, the North Fork saw 236 residential sales (mostly single-family houses) at an average price of $875,000, according to a report by the appraisal company Miller Samuel for <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman Real Estate</span>. It was the largest number of deals since the mid-2000s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than a year into the pandemic, panic no longer seems to be the main motivator for buyers, and activity has cooled. But high-water marks are still being achieved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From January to March, there were 181 residential sales at an average price of $1 million, according to the Elliman report, making it the most active winter since 2006. Last winter, in comparison, there were 114 sales at an average of $816,000, according to the report, while winter 2019 saw 110 sales at $741,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the deals, which had their closings delayed because of the high volume of transactions, reflect an earlier market. But even current demand is still intense.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On April 30, a house in Southold built in the 1970s with vaulted ceilings, which looked like it needed a little T.L.C., hit the market at $895,000 and quickly attracted 28 showings and 12 bids, said Sheri Winter-Parker of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, the property's listing agent. In early May, the house, which has four bedrooms and more than an acre, was poised to go into contract for ''hundreds of thousands over ask,'' said Ms. Winter-Parker, who added, ''It's been crazy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What differentiates the current market from last year's partly is that the buying spree of the last few months has put a major dent in supply. Further tightening inventory, brokers say, is the fact that people who might have otherwise put their homes up for sale before the pandemic decided not to do so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, there isn't the usual amount of downsizing by empty-nesters, as there are fewer empty nests: Children who moved back home last year because of the pandemic have stuck around. According to Elliman, inventory in the first quarter was down 11 percent from the fourth quarter of 2020, and down 58 percent year-over-year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among those shoppers being squeezed are traditional buyers drawn to the North Fork for a beachy part-time retreat, like Jake Neske, 45, and his wife, Amy Kommatas, 42, residents of Jersey City who had been looking for years when the pandemic hit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In November, the couple, who work in advertising, decided to make a bid on a shingle-sided two-bedroom house in Southold within days of its being listed, and without ever stepping foot inside: The seller had ''deep fears'' about Covid and refused all in-person showings, Mr. Neske said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Mr. Neske wasn't the only one enamored of the house, the former headquarters of a local cauliflower guild listed at $649,000. Eight other offers came in, though Mr. Neske's bid of $776,000 -- 20 percent over the asking price -- triumphed. ''For us, the pandemic led to a realization about scarcity and pushed us along,'' Mr. Neske said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With supply tight, and some buyers leery of the 1960s suburban-style stock that dominates some neighborhoods on the North Fork, demand for new construction is on the upswing, said Jerry Cibulski, an agent with Century 21 Albertson Realty, on the North Fork.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, a three-bedroom house on Hortons Lane in Southold that broke ground last fall went into contract a few weeks later at its introductory price of $1.2 million, said Mr. Cibulski, its broker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a nod to the tastes of the new crop of New Yorkers, said Mr. Cibulski, new-construction homes are getting finishes that were once rare or even nonexistent for the area. Developers are adding ''zoom rooms'' over garages, he said, as well as finished basements and pools.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the amenities are still not as over-the-top as in, say, Southampton. ''We may offer remote apps for sprinkler systems and window blinds,'' said Mr. Cibulski, who works with several local builders and has a half-dozen new projects in the works. ''But we're not putting in Wolf ranges and all the bells and whistles just for bragging rights.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other homeowners are upgrading houses that they once used sporadically or even rented out, pushing renovation permits to unseen levels, Southold officials say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the putting down of deeper roots seems to have a cost -- a depleted summer rental market. And with fewer properties to go around, prices are moving higher for what remains, brokers say. This summer, a five-bedroom waterfront spread can be had for $200,000; the same house would have been $120,000 pre-Covid, said Carol Szynaka, an agent with the firm Daniel Gale Sotheby's. At the low end, a three-bedroom house is listed for $30,000 a month, Ms. Szynaka added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While it can be difficult to measure how houses are ultimately used, as weekend escapes or primary homes, for instance, the North Fork does seem to have had new life in the off-season, based on those who work there year-round.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shop Sweet Indulgences, which has been open mostly every day without interruption for 28 years, has seen business in the last few months spike ''substantially, both in traffic and dollars,'' Ms. Oliveri said. The store, which is perched at a main intersection in Greenport, which in itself is like North Fork's commercial heart, sold household items like cutting boards, soaps and place mats for new or rented homes, she added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, evidence of the heated residential market has come to her front door, as real estate agents have begun stuffing cards in the jamb of her contemporary-style house urging her to sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But not everybody seems cut out for life in a vacationland, even if New York is just a couple hours away. ''Some customers tell me they can't wait to get back to their apartment,'' Ms. Oliveri said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others seem to be taking their new and quieter life in stride. Last June, Melissa Hobley, a tech executive, relocated with her family to a house in the North Fork from an apartment in Battery Park City, and liked the area so much, she bought a house, a 1950s three-bedroom in Laurel, a couple of months later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We used to be like 'New York or die.' We loved the grit, the hustle, all of it,'' said Ms. Hobley, who, as the pandemic wanes, is once again commuting a few times a week to her Manhattan office. ''But we are really loving it here.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quarterly changes show that Manhattan sales activity was climbing right along with that of its suburban neighbors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the most striking effects of the pandemic in New York was the outbound movement from Manhattan to less crowded suburban neighborhoods and the subsequent boom of the suburban real estate market. Real estate in the city and suburbs seemed to be a zero sum game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This outbound pattern created the idea that the suburbs had their day at the cities’ expense, and that cities were over,” said Jonathan Miller, of Miller Samuel, the appraisal company. “As it turns out, the assumption that there’s a binary relationship between city and suburbs isn’t quite right, as measured by sales activity.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miller contributed data for this week’s chart, which provides a timeline of sales activity in Manhattan and the suburban county of Westchester, where activity is representative of that in other New York City suburbs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the end of the second quarter of 2020 — a couple of months into the pandemic[https://www-nytimes-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/interactive/2021/04/19/upshot/how-the-pandemic-did-and-didnt-change-moves.html?searchResultPosition=20] market — sales in Manhattan had plummeted about 54 percent year over year. In Westchester, the drop in sales was about 27 percent. By Q3, six months into the pandemic, Manhattan sales had crept upward, about 46 percent lower compared with a year earlier, while Westchester’s were well on the rise, within 1 percent of the previous year’s levels. By Q4, the Westchester sales had surpassed the previous year by about 13 percent, while Manhattan sales were 21 percent lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales in Manhattan were still lagging, but there was steady improvement, and by Q1 of 2021, transactions in the borough had inched about 2 percent above the previous year’s level. Tracking the quarterly changes this way shows that Manhattan sales activity was increasing right along with that of the suburbs. So why does the dire impression of the Manhattan residential real estate market persist?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s an optics problem,” answered Mr. Miller. “Companies haven’t called their employees’ back yet. Think about Midtown office towers[https://www-nytimes-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/2021/04/15/realestate/manhattan-office-space-coronavirus.html?searchResultPosition=22] — 80 percent empty, and they support the street-level retail. So when a camera pans over Times Square, it’s all boarded-up stores. But if you did the same thing on the Upper East Side, while it’s not normal, you have people walking around all over the place, outdoor dining …”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales are one thing, but prices matter too. Median sale prices in Westchester[https://www.elliman.com/resources/siteresources/commonresources/static%20pages/images/corporate-resources/q1_2021/westchester-q1_2021.pdf] during Q1 2021 were 10.8 percent higher year over year, while in Manhattan[https://www.elliman.com/resources/siteresources/commonresources/static%20pages/images/corporate-resources/q1_2021/manhattan-q1_2021.pdf] they were up just 1.4 percent, an increase driven by larger and higher-priced units, according to Mr. Miller. “Considering that,” he said, “prices are generally down 5 to 7 percent pre- vs. post-pandemic lockdown.” But those low prices may not last. “Activity leads pricing, and the activity is there.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nervous buyers and sellers are asking: 'When is the housing market going to crash?' Here's what to expect this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As housing omens go, beware the trending <span class="companylink">Google</span> search.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first week of April, U.S. search interest in the phrase ''when is the housing market going to crash'' jumped 2,450 percent compared to the previous month, and is now more popular than anytime since 2004, according to <span class="companylink">Google</span>. The search terms ''should I buy a house'' and ''sell my house'' also reached record interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Market watchers are right to be wary. The median sale price of an existing home in the U.S. was $313,000 in February, up nearly 16 percent from a year earlier, when a 3 to 5 percent annual increase is considered healthy, according to a report from the National Association of Realtors, a trade group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think it's what's on everybody's mind,'' said Jonathan J. Miller, a New York appraiser who analyzes markets nationwide. ''How long is it going to last?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer will depend largely on where you live and how the pandemic continues to reorder buyer priorities, but it will hinge on two trends: rising mortgage rates and incredibly tight inventory in some markets, which will likely keep demand strong through the rest of 2021, even as price growth moderates, several analysts said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What awaits at the end of this frenetic period is not likely to resemble the 2008 housing bubble, which brought on a drawn-out crash when it finally burst, they said. Today's supercharged market has been caused by pandemic forces that have challenged other assumptions about the market. Even as the pendulum has swung toward increased demand in suburban markets, cities, too, are surging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, housing inventory was at a record-low 1.03 million units at the end of February, down 29.5 percent from a year earlier, a record decline, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, homes sold in an average of 20 days, a record speed, when 60 days is typical, said Lawrence Yun, the group's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It gives the feel of a bubble,'' Mr. Yun said, recalling the run-up to the subprime mortgage crisis that cratered prices after 2008. ''But the fundamental factors are different.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike the last major housing crisis, in which sale prices plummeted and many buyers were stuck with risky, adjustable-rate financing, today the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage remains near record lows, lenders rely on stricter underwriting requirements, and homeowners have more liquidity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We don't have the reckless lending that we had before,'' said Mr. Miller, and so even as market conditions get frothy, some may find that they overpaid for their property, but the ebb and flow will be more in line with regular economic cycles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the fourth quarter of 2021, Mr. Yun predicts the volume of U.S. home sales to drop 10 percent compared to the year-ago period, as mortgage rates climb closer to 3.5 percent, up from about 2.7 percent at the start of 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also expects home prices to keep rising in the short term, because of more than a decade of sluggish housing construction, hobbled by restrictive zoning and high labor costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the pandemic has affected markets in different ways. In New York City, where commercial real estate was battered and home buyers fanned outward to surrounding suburbs in search of affordability and more space, the sales market fell off at the beginning of the pandemic but appears to have turned the corner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The rate at which homes are selling nationally is not sustainable, but in New York, the uptick is just getting started,'' said Nancy Wu, an economist for StreetEasy, a listing website.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the week ending April 11, there were 783 new signed contracts citywide, the highest since the company began tracking weekly pending sales in 2019, when the peak was 491 contracts, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike much of the country, New York had a glut of luxury inventory before the pandemic, and prices had been softening since around 2017. From 2018 to the end of 2019, Manhattan saw a roughly 15 percent drop in sale prices, Mr. Miller said. In aggregate, prices have fallen another 5 to 7 percent since Covid arrived, to a median $1.075 million last quarter, and sellers are finally getting more realistic, he said. (One-bedroom apartments, the largest share of apartments sold, closed for a median $760,000.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price cuts have been a boon to a broader range of people. First-time buyers made up 41.9 percent of sales in Manhattan last quarter, the highest share in at least seven years, Mr. Miller said. And the share of all-cash buyers fell to 39.3 percent, a seven-year low, which could reflect both favorable interest rates and a shift away from investment buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the city's luxury stock, which has seen some of the largest price cuts, is on an upswing, said Donna Olshan, the president of Olshan Realty, which tracks the market at $4 million and above. As of April 18, the city has recorded 11 straight weeks with 30 or more contracts signed in that tier, the longest such streak since at least 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It does have the potential to last for a while, because the results are only based on a half-tank of gas,'' Ms. Olshan said, referring to the fact that most of these signings were from domestic and local buyers, as international buyers remain mostly on the sidelines with travel restrictions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is already a shift in the mood in the city, as vaccinations progress and buyers anticipate the benefits of the federal stimulus package, said Mark Chin, an agent and the co-head of training at Keller Williams New York City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People that signed contracts even two months ago are absolutely thrilled they did, because the bottom is already over,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York's revival also challenges one of the early assumptions during the pandemic -- that the suburbs would benefit at the expense of big cities, where buyers, untethered from office commutes, could choose to live farther from work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, a new analysis of Postal Service change-of-address requests shows that migratory patterns since Covid-19 haven't changed as much as some predicted. New York did see a surge in outbound migration, but that was a trend that started before the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The easy answer was: the city is down, the suburbs are up,'' said Mr. Miller. ''And now it turns out that both are up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, thanks to limited supply, many suburbs remain in high demand. Fairfield County, Conn., for instance, recorded 3,045 sales last quarter, the most in that period in more than 16 years, along with the lowest inventory in 25 years, according to a report from the brokerage <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with prices jumping close to 20 percent in some outlier markets, Mr. Miller does not expect the gains to continue apace for long, in part because the appeal of many suburbs is affordability, relative to big cities. The extent to which remote work will remain a feature of life after the virus is also still unclear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Manhattan finally joined the party,'' he said, referring to the city's sales turnaround. ''But we're not sure if this is the party we want to be in -- because there's uncertainty about how this plays out.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of New Homes Rebounded in March</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes surged 20.7 percent in March to the highest level since 2006, rebounding from a sharp decline the previous month when severe winter storms wreaked havoc in many parts of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales climbed to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.02 million last month after a 16.2 percent tumble in February, the Commerce Department reported on Friday. It was the fastest pace for new home sales since the housing boom of the mid-2000s when sales reached 1.04 million units in August 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price of a new home sold in March was $330,800, up only 0.8 percent from the median sales price a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big jump in new home sales stands in contrast to sales of existing homes, which fell for a second consecutive month in March, a drop that was blamed on a lack of supply which has pushed exiting home prices to new highs.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sale price of an existing home in the United States was $329,100 in March, up 17.2 percent from a year earlier, when a 3 to 5 percent annual increase is considered healthy, according to a report from the National Association of Realtors, a trade group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, housing inventory was at 1.07 million units at the end of March, just above its record low of 1.03 million the prior month and down 28.2 percent from a year earlier, the group said on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new single-family houses soared the highest level since 2006 in March, the Census Bureau reported on Friday, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.021 million, up 21 percent from February. The typical new home sold for $330,800, down from its recent peak of $365,300 in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing homes typically sold in 18 days, a record speed. Normally, 60 days is typical, Lawrence Yun, the National Association of Realtors’ chief economist, told Stefanos Chen of The New York Times[https://www-nytimes-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/2021/04/22/realestate/us-home-sales-surge.html].</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nervous buyers and sellers are asking: ‘When is the housing market going to crash?’ Here’s what to expect this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As housing omens go, beware the trending <span class="companylink">Google</span> search.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first week of April, U.S. search interest in the phrase “when is the housing market going to crash” jumped 2,450 percent compared to the previous month, and is now more popular[https://trends-google-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/trends/explore?date=all&amp;geo=US&amp;q=when%20is%20the%20housing%20market%20going%20to%20crash] than anytime since 2004, according to <span class="companylink">Google</span>. The search terms “should I buy a house” and “sell my house” also reached record interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Market watchers are right to be wary. The median sale price of an existing home in the U.S. was $313,000 in February, up nearly 16 percent from a year earlier, when a 3 to 5 percent annual increase is considered healthy, according to a report from the National Association of Realtors, a trade group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think it’s what’s on everybody’s mind,” said Jonathan J. Miller, a New York appraiser who analyzes markets nationwide. “How long is it going to last?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer will depend largely on where you live and how the pandemic continues to reorder buyer priorities, but it will hinge on two trends: rising mortgage rates and incredibly tight inventory in some markets, which will likely keep demand strong through the rest of 2021, even as price growth moderates, several analysts said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What awaits at the end of this frenetic period is not likely to resemble the 2008 housing bubble, which brought on a drawn-out crash when it finally burst, they said. Today’s supercharged market has been caused by pandemic forces that have challenged other assumptions about the market. Even as the pendulum has swung toward increased demand in suburban markets, cities, too, are surging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, housing inventory was at a record-low 1.03 million units at the end of February, down 29.5 percent from a year earlier, a record decline, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, homes sold[https://www-nytimes-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/2021/05/14/your-money/buying-home-market.html] in an average of 20 days, a record speed, when 60 days is typical, said Lawrence Yun, the group’s chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It gives the feel of a bubble,” Mr. Yun said, recalling the run-up to the subprime mortgage crisis that cratered prices after 2008. “But the fundamental factors are different.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike the last major housing crisis, in which sale prices plummeted and many buyers were stuck with risky, adjustable-rate financing, today the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage remains near record lows, lenders rely on stricter underwriting requirements, and homeowners have more liquidity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We don’t have the reckless lending that we had before,” said Mr. Miller, and so even as market conditions get frothy, some may find that they overpaid for their property, but the ebb and flow will be more in line with regular economic cycles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the fourth quarter of 2021, Mr. Yun predicts the volume of U.S. home sales to drop 10 percent compared to the year-ago period, as mortgage rates climb closer to 3.5 percent, up from about 2.7 percent at the start of 2021.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also expects home prices to keep rising in the short term, because of more than a decade of sluggish housing construction, hobbled by restrictive zoning and high labor costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the pandemic has affected markets in different ways. In New York City, where commercial real estate was battered and home buyers fanned outward to surrounding suburbs in search of affordability and more space, the sales market fell off at the beginning of the pandemic but appears to have turned the corner[https://www-nytimes-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/2021/04/02/realestate/manhattan-sales-market-revival.html].</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing sales in New York City are finally picking up — along with deep discounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anyone rooting for the recovery of New York City’s housing market has probably been heartened by the data trickling out of brokerages in the past few months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a pace that is strong enough to rival that of previous busy periods, buyers have been scooping up new homes, including apartments in condo developments that have lagged for years — but often at huge discounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To drag their projects across the finish line, some developers have been slashing prices by as much as half, which could be the equivalent of millions of dollars less per apartment than originally intended. That is in addition to now-typical concessions like free common charges, free parking or a cash credit to pay for an interior designer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The aggressive discounting may be necessary, especially in Manhattan, where sales have been weaker than in Brooklyn or Queens. From soaring condos in affluent enclaves like TriBeCa to boutique buildings on gentrifying blocks in the East Village, Manhattan is awash in price cuts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s like the Rothschilds used to say: ‘If there’s blood on the streets, take advantage of it,’” said Graham Spearman, the founder of Blu Marketing, which embraced discounts to unload three apartments at the condo 260 Bowery in the past year. “We’re willing to negotiate.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as buyers have re-emerged, the new development market continues to struggle, in large part because sales had slowed[https://www-nytimes-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/2019/09/13/realestate/new-development-new-york.html?] before the pandemic hit. So even as new buildings are launching sales, they must compete with recently built towers that have yet to sell out, which is forcing the older units to discount to keep pace with new arrivals. At the same time, developers known for brash optimism are admitting the once-unthinkable: Some projects will fail financially.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“From here on in, it has to go up,” said Gary Barnett, the chairman of the Extell Development Company, adding that three of six of his current condos are expected to be money-losers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some coping strategies are familiar from previous downturns. In addition to those free common charges, some developers are trying to buy time by selling multiple floors to a single investor at cut-rate prices. And some projects have switched to rentals, abandoning condo dreams.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are differences, as well. Unlike in the last collapse, in 2008, lenders don’t seem to be shutting down construction. Instead, they are taking a longer view, extending lifeline after lifeline to keep condos afloat, although it is the major builders who are mostly benefiting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Price-wise, the Manhattan condo with the widest gulf between expectations and reality may be 111 Murray Street, a 157-unit project in TriBeCa that has spent six years trying to attract buyers. The average discount between first and final prices there is 38 percent, based on an analysis of winter closings by Garrett Derderian, a director at the brokerage Serhant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The everything-must-go strategy may be working. As of last month, 150 of the 157 apartments were spoken for, said Winston C. Fisher, a partner at <span class="companylink">Fisher Brothers</span>, which codeveloped the condo with the firms Witkoff and New Valley. In March, according to StreetEasy, a four-bedroom on the 22nd floor was the condo’s least-expensive unit, at $6.25 million. (The average Manhattan apartment last year cost around $1.9 million.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’re proud of our sales to date,” Mr. Fisher said in a statement, “and our ability to shift in a changing marketplace.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two projects from the Related Companies, one of New York’s largest landlords, are also in deals mode.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 35 Hudson Yards, a tower with hotel rooms, offices and 143 residential condos that has been around for two years, a 23 percent discount was in effect, based on Mr. Derderian’s data. Nearby, 15 Hudson Yards, a 284-unit condo marketed since 2016, shaved prices by 17 percent. “Pricing is a reflection of market conditions, and as a result of current pricing there is really strong sales momentum,” a Related spokeswoman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A singular challenge of the current market, brokers said, is how much older housing stock has been hanging around. The condo 157 West 57th Street, from <span class="companylink">Extell Development Company</span>, for instance, still has not sold all of its sponsor units despite marketing them for a decade. This winter, units at the blue-tinted skyscraper, which helped usher in the name Billionaires’ Row, traded 24 percent down, Mr. Derderian said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We are in a very weird cycle right now,” said Mr. Spearman of Blu, who used to work for Extell. “The weird part is the overhang of old inventory. There’s an oversupply, and a narrow bandwidth for buyers.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the average discount at some Manhattan condos is large, the reductions on specific units can seem staggering. The penthouse at 37 East 12th Street, which the developer, Edward J. Minskoff Equities, hoped to sell for $33.5 million when it was listed in 2015, finally closed in February for $15.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I just wanted to get it off my plate and not think about it,” Mr. Minskoff said, adding that the development, with one of its six units remaining, would likely be unprofitable. “That’s not what I would have hoped.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the last asking price for the penthouse, about $20 million, can seem divorced from reality, although it points to a market-wide trend of new developments being sharply discounted even in the final rounds of marketing, brokers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, waiting years until buyers come around is not an option for some developers. Pressured by lenders to generate at least some revenue as loans come due, some sponsors are selling groups of apartments in bulk to single investors to move the product along, even if that means losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This winter, the El Ad Group sold 70 units at Charlie West, a 123-unit condo in Midtown, to Tishman Realty in an $87 million deal — which represents a 40 percent cut, according to a source familiar with the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such a clearance sale could translate into big savings for buyers when the Tishman units hit the market, brokers said, although it could also drive down prices on El Ad’s remaining inventory in the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representatives for El Ad and Tishman had no comment on the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charlie West, which was built at 505 West 43rd Street on a platform atop railroad tracks, has also tried less-aggressive tactics. Last summer, El Ad began offering $10,000 credits that could be redeemed to decorate apartments, at a time when the condo had sold only a quarter of its apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While freebies like design bonuses may not be as significant as price cuts, they can help get buyers through the door, an important consideration where activity has been flat. In February, for example, 500 West 25th Street, an eight-unit condo called the Emerson near the High Line, began offering a pair of concessions — a year’s worth of free common charges and parking fees — worth about $30,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I hope it will make us stand out from the crowd,” said Michael Kirchmann, the chief executive of GDS Development, the developer of the condo, which has not sold a unit since marketing began last summer, but has rejected lowball offers. (A three-bedroom with a balcony is about $4.5 million.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alternative strategies are also getting a look. Three Waterline Square, a tower that is part of a complex on the Far West Side, originally planned to offer 47 condo units atop 167 rentals. But sales were so sluggish that after three years the condo did not meet the key legal threshold of 15 percent of its apartments sold — in this case, seven of them — which would have allowed closings to begin and buyers to move in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So last March, as Covid hit, GID Development Group, the project’s sponsor, decided to turn the whole 34-story tower into a rental building, returning some deposits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers of small projects are also thinking creatively. Last month, at Houston House, a boutique building in the East Village, the developer, Matthew Lee, decided to try boosting sales by auctioning off a low-floor unit at the condo, which has sold just two of its seven units in three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bidding for the auctioned apartment, valued at $3.4 million in the offering plan, began at $1.75 million and attracted 10 bidders, before ultimately trading above that reserve. Misha Haghani, the founder of Paramount Realty USA, which ran the auction, would not say how much it sold for.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“How do you create urgency in a market that is lacking urgency?” Mr. Haghani said. “How do you generate excitement?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Houston House and similar projects are in a tough spot, said Kael Goodman, the president of Marketproof, a real estate company that analyzes the health of developments on behalf of investors, using an algorithm that looks at sales figures and other data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On one hand, the condos have completed enough construction to be at least partially up and running, a point of no return for many projects. But sales are slow and residents are few, which means that developers, not owners, are on the hook for the bulk of operational expenses, including electricity, staff salaries and taxes. And those tabs can run to several million dollars a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even projects that seemed healthy a few years back may be struggling now, as buyers renegotiate contracts to obtain more favorable pricing or simply walk away to cut losses, Mr. Goodman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, there were 78 of those potentially troubled condos citywide, with a total of 1,872 apartments, according to Marketproof, which scours public sources for its data, a task that can be difficult in the notoriously opaque real estate industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan accounted for 22 of the condos, some of which have been marketed for a decade and still reflect the aspirations of an earlier era. “What was built then is not really appropriate for the buyer of today, because how many billionaires are really out there?” Mr. Goodman said. “The type of buyer has changed.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the condos on Marketproof’s red-flag list is Greenwich West, a 169-unit building at 110 Charlton Street from a team that includes Strategic Capital, the investment arm of China Construction America. The condo, in Hudson Square, is the first for Strategic in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In mid-March, after three years of sales, just 13 percent of the units were closed or in contract, according to Marketproof. And the building has been fully open since February, meaning there is no longer any major barrier to closings, even if that process can take several months. A spokesman for the project declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the flip side, Greenwich West does not seem to be slashing prices to speed things along. More than half of the units with completed deals sold for slightly more than their intended prices, like No. 11B, a one-bedroom originally listed for $1.5 million that ended up selling for $1.625 million. But the increases are not a sign of bidding wars. The developer hiked some prices along the way, so the values are in line with revised expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The development team, which includes Cape Advisors and Forum Absolute Capital Partners, and which paid $52 million for the site in 2014, may be trying not to bend until the market recovers, analysts said. But that go-slow approach may be testing the patience of <span class="companylink">Bank OZK</span>, which lent the project $124 million, $92 million of which remained outstanding in March, according to city records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A bank spokeswoman said the condo’s developers had actually paid down the balance of their mortgage since last month, but declined to provide documentation and had no further comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other properties on Marketproof’s list include Central Park Tower, a 178-unit Extell project marketed since 2018 and partially open as of this winter. Although deal activity picked up at the condo in March, Mr. Barnett said, overall conditions remain challenging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, three of Extell’s six current condo projects — a group that includes 1010 Park Avenue, an 11-unit building on the Upper East Side with two unsold apartments — will not turn a profit, said Mr. Barnett, who declined to be more specific. “Some will be small losses, and some will be big losses,” he said. “At the end of the day, you’re at the mercy of the market.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The downturn hasn’t been victimless. Over the last few months, HFZ Capital Group has surrendered the keys to four of its Manhattan projects to <span class="companylink">CIM Group</span>, its lender, over missed payments. HFZ, a prolific builder that once seemed to have a project in every trendy neighborhood, is also locked in a court battle over troubled loans for the XI, the twisting, two-towered hotel and condo project near the High Line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, not every project seems to be in the hot seat. At 130 William, a 242-unit high-rise in the financial district, there was zero difference between listing and closing prices this winter, Mr. Derderian said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But buyers have tried to get deals. Emboldened by learning that his sister convinced a developer of a Gramercy condo to knock $300,000 off the price tag, Henry Minskoff decided to adopt a similar strategy when he began looking at 130 William last spring. “I thought, ‘She got a pretty crazy deal; maybe I can, too,’” said Mr. Minskoff, an affordable housing developer (and a relative of Edward Minskoff). But the developer, Lightstone, “really held the line,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end, he and his wife, Jennifer, a teacher, bought their two-bedroom for just over $3 million, a price that Lightstone sought from the start.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lightstone declined to share how many units have sold at the address.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other places where bargains may be scarce include the Vandewater, a 183-unit condo from Savanna; Rose Hill, a 123-unit tower from <span class="companylink">Rockefeller Group</span>; and 25 Park Row, a 110-unit offering from a team led by L+M Development Partners. All three had closing prices within a few percentage points of their introductory prices, Mr. Derderian said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers late to the Covid market may have been in a better position to adapt to it, leaving less wiggle room for buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In February 2020, Grid Group began marketing a 15-unit church-straddling condo at 124 West 16th Street in Chelsea. Four units traded pre-Covid, said Yiannes Einhorn, Grid’s managing principal, before sales were suspended for months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When sales resumed, buyers pounced, snapping up eight apartments at prices ranging from $3.5 million to $11.5 million, or about $2,300 a square foot, Mr. Einhorn said. (The church got the final three apartments.) After less than a year, the condo sold out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while Mr. Einhorn never formally shaved prices — a sign of possible weakness, and an invitation to demand bargains, in some developers’ eyes — he cut some deals, although by no more than 5 percent. “A smaller boutique building is not always in fashion, because it doesn’t have the bowling alleys and movie theaters,” he said. “But I think we proved there’s an attraction to this product.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether discreet or out in the open, bargains may increase in the coming months, as developers run out of rope with their lenders and are forced to shed inventory. And for the overall health of the market, that may not be such a bad thing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Developers are always getting drunk on the power of building and believe their own product is better than anybody else’s,” said Donna Olshan, the president of Olshan Realty, a company that tracks high-end sales. “But that makes you too emotionally attached. They need to be detached and to constantly re-evaluate.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Increase in Home Prices Approaches 15-Year High</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in housing prices continued to accelerate in January, pushing the rate of increases in one closely watched measure of prices near a 15-year high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices of existing homes rose 11.2 percent in January compared with a year earlier, according to the S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index. In December, that increase was 10.4 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The trend of accelerating prices that began in June 2020 has now reached its eighth month,'' said Craig J. Lazzara, managing director and global head of index investment strategy at <span class="companylink">S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 30-year history of S&amp;P Case-Shiller monthly data, he said, fewer than 10 percent showed prices growing at faster rates, all during the housing bubble from 2004 to 2006. The highest rate was in September 2005, when home prices increased as much as 14.5 percent from the year before. TARA SIEGEL BERNARD</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the most vulnerable Americans still have not received their stimulus checks, but millions of them who receive federal benefits should get their payments next week, according to the <span class="companylink">Internal Revenue Service</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People who receive benefits from Social Security, Supplemental Security Income, the <span class="companylink">Railroad Retirement Board</span> and Veterans Affairs -- but do not file tax returns because they do not meet the income thresholds -- were among those who faced delays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But most of them -- with the exception of those receiving benefits from Veterans Affairs -- could have their payments arrive by direct deposit on April 7, as long as there are no further problems. Veterans Affairs beneficiaries will have to wait a bit longer; the I.R.S. estimates their checks could be issued by mid-April and expects to provide more specifics soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The payments have been delayed because the I.R.S. did not have the proper files to process them until last week. TARA SIEGEL BERNARD</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in housing prices continued to accelerate in January, pushing the rate of increases in one closely watched measure of prices near a 15-year high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices of existing homes rose 11.2 percent in January compared with a year earlier, according to the S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index. In December, that increase was 10.4 percent compared with the prior year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The trend of accelerating prices that began in June 2020 has now reached its eighth month,” said Craig J. Lazzara, managing director and global head of index investment strategy at <span class="companylink">S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“January’s performance is particularly impressive in historical context,” he added. In the 30-year history of S&amp;P Case-Shiller data, he said, fewer than 10 percent of monthly showed prices growing at faster rates. And all of those months were during the housing bubble between2004 and 2006. The highest rate of growth was in September 2005, when home prices increased as much as 14.5 percent from the year prior.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So as high as January’s figure was, Mr. Lazzara said, “We are well short of that.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several factors are probably behind the continued price growth: Interest rates remain relatively low, many families have been seeking more space during the pandemic and there has been a steep decline in housing inventory[https://www-nytimes-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/2021/02/26/upshot/where-have-all-the-houses-gone.html]. According to the National Association of Realtors, existing home inventory was at a record-low of 1.03 million units in February, down 29.5 percent from the year prior. Properties typically sold in 20 days, it said, another record low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“January’s data remain consistent with the view that Covid has encouraged potential buyers to move from urban apartments to suburban homes,” Mr. Lazzara said. “This demand may represent buyers who accelerated purchases that would have happened anyway over the next several years.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the metro areas tracked by S&amp;P’s 20-city composite index, Phoenix, Seattle, and San Diego continued to log the highest year-over-year price gains in January. Home prices in Phoenix rose 15.8 percent in January compared with the year prior, while Seattle saw a 14.3 percent increase, and San Diego prices increased 14.2 percent.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Yorkers scouring northern towns for second homes have pushed prices up and made it harder for locals to find affordable homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meghan McCann, a sales representative for a wine and liquor company, has spent more than a year looking for a house in Columbia County, in the northern Hudson Valley, where she was born and raised.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. McCann, 39, who grew up in Copake Falls, less than 10 minutes from the town of Hillsdale, where she currently rents with her fiancé, Joseph Walters, said she was preapproved for a $270,000 mortgage, but “it wasn’t enough.” Every house she and Mr. Walters looked at sold within two weeks for prices that beggared belief.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now they are budgeting up to $350,000, or maybe more, in hopes of finding a small property on a few acres that they expect will probably have foundation problems or a leaky roof. Though it helps that Mr. Walters is in construction, this wasn’t what they had bargained for.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We don’t want to have to do a lot of work,” Ms. McCann said, pointing out that the cost of building materials has recently skyrocketed, making a fixer-upper a more serious investment. “We want to go out to dinner and take vacations.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the real estate market remains on a boil in New York’s Hudson Valley, heated in large part by second-home buyers re-evaluating their commitment to urban living, longtime residents are experiencing both prosperity and pain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A wave of newcomers, drawn by the painterly beauty and burgeoning craft and food culture of this region, are helping to sustain local businesses, allowing bars and shops to flourish, and keeping construction companies and maintenance crews active.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, they are vacuuming up much of the available housing, leading to bidding wars and inflated prices. The ambitions of many second-home seekers from outside the area are frustrated, but so are the desires of locals looking for primary residences. Houses listed far above their appraisal values sell to buyers with suitcases of cash. Property taxes threaten to rise. Hearts break. Lives are disrupted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patricia, a 55-year-old nurse who lives in Rockland County, in the southern Hudson Valley, and who asked that her last name not be divulged in case it scuttled her chances of buying a house, was so confident that she could find the upstate home of her dreams that she and her husband sold their farmhouse in August before completing their search.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They wanted a historic property in turnkey condition with at least two acres and a swimming pool. Now, after combing through listings and submitting half a dozen bids — all rejected — they are resigned to settling for a fixer-upper that breaks their $650,000 budget. They have until May — when the new owners take possession of their Rockland County house — to find it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We have a lead on something because somebody has passed away, and somebody who knew somebody who knew somebody said it might work for us,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ten New York counties make up the Hudson Valley, from Westchester to Rensselaer on the east side of the river, and from Rockland to Albany on the west side. From January 2020 through January 2021, the average median sale price of a home in Columbia County, where Hillsdale is located, rose 13.6 percent, from $266,250 to $302,500, according to the New York State Association of Realtors. (This is close to the national median sale price as of January of $303,900, a year-over-year increase of 14.1 percent.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Dutchess County, just south of Columbia County, the median sale price rose 30.3 percent through 2020, arriving at $358,250 in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As with overheated markets throughout the country, these price hikes reflect a diminishing supply. In that same period, the average number of residences for sale in both Columbia and Dutchess counties dropped 37 percent, as owners clung to their homes as refuges, rented them at juicy rates or realized that they could sell at a profit, but then where would they go?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Bradway, who owns a plumbing and heating business in Hillsdale, said he knows people in the community who have chosen to cash out and move as far away as South Carolina. “If I was on the brink of wanting to go somewhere else, it would be the time,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Bradway, 38, is running a surging business, thanks in large part to the second-home community. In the first, cold months of the pandemic, he got houses ready for owners who planned to use them as shelters and wanted to cram in extended family members and friends. Mr. Bradway had to install bigger hot water heaters and replace sewer lines to support the overload.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In summer, he was busy with air conditioning. Through the fall and into winter, he repaired frozen pipes in houses where absent owners neglected to turn off the water, and set fixtures for increasingly large and lavish new builds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he is thankful but somewhat weary. His team of seven, including him and his wife, Rachael, went from 40-hour to 80-hour workweeks in March “and never looked back.” Eventually he added three people, but it was still not enough to meet rapid demand. Some of his newer clients have shown little tolerance for delays, he said, chalking up their impatience to a lack of familiarity with the town and its rhythms, and possibly to pandemic-related stress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There would be no problem growing the business to twice or three times what it was if the employees were here,” Mr. Bradway said. But “it’s tough in this area to find qualified help for what we do.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">West of the Hudson River, in the tiny Ulster County hamlet of Accord, Jacob Meglio also has found profit — and some ambivalence — in the influx of newcomers. Mr. Meglio, 32, is a co-founder and managing partner of Arrowood Farm, a brewery and distillery that grows much of the produce it uses and was able to keep its bar open this winter for the first time in five years of operation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Born in nearby Kingston and a citizen of Accord, he views this windfall through a double lens. The pandemic has been “great for business, but challenging for the people we care about,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“<span class="companylink">Airbnb</span>’s the third rail around here,” he noted. “People either own one or they don’t, and they begrudge each other because of it.” From the business side, Airbnbs are a boon — the renters often patronize his bar. From the community side, the price of houses that used to rent for $1,000 have quintupled, “and it’s totally inaccessible for regular folks.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Meglio pointed to a long-term trend of urbanites discovering the Hudson Valley. His own parents moved from New York City in the late 1980s, and there was a large wave after 9/11. Like many of his peers, he left Ulster County to attend college and have a look at the world, returning in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The area has always had poverty, he said. What is different now is the number of working-class people who are struggling to find affordable housing. And some of his peers who moved away would like to repatriate but are shut out of the market. (The median sale price in the county in January was $275,000, a year-over-year increase of 14.6 percent; at that time, there were 682 homes for sale, a year-over-year decline of 42.3 percent.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s not so much that change is happening, but that it’s happening so fast. What is the collateral damage?” Mr. Meglio asked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Housing Action Plan[https://ulstercountyny.gov/sites/default/files/documents/planning/2021_uc_hap.pdf], a report released this month by Ulster County, describes a crisis that was years in the making but sharply exacerbated by the pandemic. It found that in two-thirds of the county’s municipalities, a family earning “a typical income” could afford fewer than 10 percent of the homes that were on the market last fall. Among its recommendations is investigating scattered sites and buildings that could be developed and repurposed for residential use. Next year, construction will begin where a jail now stands in Kingston to create 80 units each of senior and work force housing affordable to people making between 30 and 130 percent of the median income in the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Throughout the Hudson Valley, communities are struggling to loosen the economic chokehold on the housing market. They are regulating short-term rentals, approving accessory dwelling units, imposing transfer taxes on high-value properties to subsidize environmental protections and enacting other measures designed to increase equity[https://therivernewsroom.com/real-estate-transfer-tax-community-preservation-new-paltz/] that are promoted by old-timers and newcomers alike.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tod Wohlfarth, a creative marketing director who moved into his weekend house in Hillsdale in 2014 and has been active in Democratic politics in both the town and Columbia County, acknowledges a persistent divide between the haves and have-nots. It dates, he said, from more than a century ago, when the Hudson Valley was a refuge for New Yorkers fleeing outbreaks of cholera and yellow fever. It accelerated in the last eight years, after the economic downturn diverted wealth to the region from places like the Hamptons and Martha’s Vineyard. And it is sustained by high-speed internet, which has allowed people earning their living beyond the community to remain and work remotely in what is often a bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Wohlfarth, 50, who labored to bring broadband to Hillsdale, believes remote work is its future. He also dreams of more vocational training for area job seekers, a transfer tax that could be diverted to finance affordable housing, and a mentorship program at the schools that would bring together some of the highly successful part-timers with the local population. “If you have a community that’s really only here Saturday and Sunday, there’s a disconnect, he said. “They don’t feel invested.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lack of emotional investment is what Patricia, the nurse in Rockland County, fears from her competitors in the market for antique homes. Given how tetchy an old house can be, she was surprised to find herself competing with so many eager bidders. Were the properties being scooped up out of desperation? Would the buyers gut their interiors to make them over in the image of the houses they couldn’t find? Would “these treasures,” as she described them, end up looking like everything else?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And what will she do if she doesn’t secure her own treasure by May? “We’ll put our stuff in storage and maybe rent a motor house and camp out on my nephew’s lawn,” she said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lines of cars at open houses and multiple offers above the asking price, often all cash, have become a regular occurrence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Heading into the spring sales season, the housing market[https://www-nytimes-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/2021/04/22/realestate/us-home-sales-surge.html] in the suburbs of New York has already gone into overdrive, with bidding wars becoming the norm and many homes selling within days of coming on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The frenetic sales activity — a second wave after a surge last summer[https://www-nytimes-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/2020/08/30/nyregion/nyc-suburbs-housing-demand.html] — has been fueled by multiple forces: historically low mortgage rates; pandemic-fatigued city dwellers desperate for more space; and many employers’ willingness to embrace remote work, allowing buyers to look in places beyond what would be considered an easy commute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another major factor: unusually tight inventory[https://www-nytimes-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/2021/02/26/upshot/where-have-all-the-houses-gone.html], as people hold onto their homes longer, which over the last few months in some suburbs has led to demand outstripping supply for the first time since the pandemic began.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers across the region report long lines at open houses, multiple offers coming in as soon as listings go live, and all-cash deals ruling the day. “This is the strongest market I have seen in two decades,” said Sara Littlefield, an agent in Connecticut with Coldwell Banker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If there is a silver lining in this devastating pandemic, it’s that it has allowed people the freedom to make lifestyle choices like relocating, or downsizing, or moving up,” Ms. Littlefield added, “and they’re taking that freedom.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, Manhattan’s housing market has also finally picked up. “Contract activity first broke even back in December with year-ago levels,” said Jonathan J. Miller, a Manhattan-based real estate appraiser who also monitors suburban markets. Then it rose in the first two months of 2021, he said, adding that he expected the strong pace to continue through the spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a just-released February report for <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman Real Estate</span>, Mr. Miller found that signed contracts for all property types in Manhattan jumped 73.1 percent from a year ago. “It’s a combination of softer pricing, low rates and the distribution of the vaccine — people are feeling more safe about living in the city,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeffrey Otteau, the president of the Otteau Valuation Group, based in Matawan, N.J., agreed that once-depressed urban areas would recover. “I don’t think anyone expected people would leave the city,” he said, “and never come back.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For those buyers focused on the suburbs, here’s a glimpse at what’s going on throughout the region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Westchester</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brisk could describe the weather and pace of sales in Westchester this winter, as the single-family sales market builds on its 2020 gains, from Pelham to Scarsdale to Armonk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A shortage of single-family houses explains the heightened competition. Starting last fall, demand began eclipsing supply, according to a new report from <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>, and signed contracts have picked up since January: The busiest brackets have been houses priced from $1 million to $2 million, with $600,000 to $800,000 a close second.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the crop of deals that closed this winter, the time from being listed to going into contract had shrunk to just two months, according to Julia B. Sotheby’s International Realty, though brokers say that spread can be misleading because much of the time is eaten up by overworked bankers and lawyers completing paperwork.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In actuality, some houses are finding new owners shortly after hitting “coming soon” websites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Buyers think they are buying at the peak, but at the same time, they’re still doing it,” said Jennifer Meyer, a Compass agent, who received an offer on a six-bedroom Tudor-style house in Pelham, listed for $1.275 million, on Feb. 26, two days after it went live.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low interest rates and scarce inventory, which are national trends, explain some of the local spike in demand and prices. But other factors are also in play.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After spending extended time outside of New York to avoid coronavirus, lockdowns and street protests, some buyers warmed to the idea of full-time nonurban life. Troy Benson, 37, who owns a marketing firm, and his husband, Nolan Fitzgerald, 34, who works in fashion, so enjoyed the months spent in their weekend house in Orange County that they decided to stay out of the city for good.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After selling the vacation property — in two days, for 15 percent more than its asking price — as well as their condo in the South Street Seaport, the couple are in contract for a midcentury modern house by Edgar Tafel[https://www-nytimes-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/2011/01/25/arts/design/25tafel.html] on six woodsy acres in Armonk last listed at $2.475 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“New York is very high energy,” said Mr. Benson, who will scale down his time in his Manhattan office to just a few days a week. “But I think a lot of people get addicted to the energy and get stuck.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent converts to Westchester, brokers say, also include New Yorkers facing expiring leases on the rentals they escaped to last spring and who are now angling for more permanent addresses, further pressuring the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it’s not just transplants who are being squeezed. Last year, Marialena Pulice, 39, a school psychologist, and her husband, Chris, 39, who works in finance, made offers on 15 houses, most of which were rejected. “We were outbid, or the seller would go with somebody who had a bigger down payment,” Mr. Pulice said. “Houses were being scooped up left and right.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late last year, a three-bedroom house in Hawthorne, listed at $589,000, caught the eye of the couple. But their above-ask offer of $595,000 was not enough to seal the deal — at least until the first buyer backed out. The Pulices, who have a young son, have been staying with Ms. Pulice’s parents and will move into their new home this month. “I really can’t wait,” Mr. Pulice said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Jersey</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The spring market really began in October — that’s how crazy it’s been,” according to Vicki Gaily, a real estate agent based in Saddle River, N.J.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As soon as pandemic restrictions eased, Ms. Gaily, the founder of Special Properties, a division of the real estate firm Brook Hollow Group, noticed a burst of pent-up demand, largely from people fleeing urban areas. “I haven’t had a day off since,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her biggest challenge — and the task facing other harried agents across the state — is finding enough available properties to sell at all price points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of January, there were nearly 44 percent fewer homes listed for sale in New Jersey from a year ago, according to the New Jersey Realtors[http://njar-public.stats.10kresearch.com/docs/lmu/x/EntireState?src=page] trade association. At the same time, closed sales rose during the month by 17 percent and the median sales price surged about 20 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I’ve never seen the inventories as low as they are now,” Ms. Gaily said, noting that in Saddle River, which is in Bergen County, there are “maybe 40 homes” available right now, down from the usual range of 55 to 85 this time of year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Farther south, in Westfield, in Union County, “we have about a third of what we should have in inventory this time of year,” said Frank D. Isoldi, an agent at Coldwell Banker Realty based in Westfield. The result, he said, has been homes being snatched up quickly after multiple bids, and often above asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The only houses on the market that are sticking around are those that are not so wonderful,” said Roberta Baldwin, an agent with <span class="companylink">Keller Williams Realty</span> who is based in Montclair, in Essex County, where bidding wars are also more common.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To help get a leg up on the competition, one of her clients, Brian Herlihy, a 42-year-old financial analyst from Manhattan’s Upper West Side, actually devised a bidding formula last summer, based on the price per square foot of comparable sold properties. “But even then we got outbid,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end, after several unsuccessful bids, Mr. Herlihy and his partner, Emily McDonald, a 38-year-old high school teacher from Brooklyn, managed to move into a fully renovated, four-bedroom colonial in Upper Montclair — but only after the original winning bidder backed out of the deal. Mr. Herlihy paid $1.1 million for the home, which was about $100,000 over his maximum budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jaclyn and Zach Plotkin also exceeded what they had hoped to pay when recently buying an Upper Montclair colonial. “We paid a lot over — I don’t want to say how much,” said Ms. Plotkin, 28. “When we started looking, we were less comfortable with bidding over the asking price, but then we came to realize that we had to in order to get a house.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple and their infant daughter plan to move from their Midtown East apartment sometime this spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long Island</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers throughout Long Island are likely to face continued competition, too, along with rising prices, in large part because of the shrinking supply of available homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In the last two months we’ve seen such a depletion of new inventory that sales growth has been nominal,” said Mr. Miller, the Manhattan-based appraiser who also follows the Long Island market. He noted in the <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span> report that signed contracts in February were flat from a year ago, while inventory levels, excluding the Hamptons and the North Fork, fell nearly 37 percent. “That’s a free-fall.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(The Hamptons saw a 72 percent jump in signed contracts in February for single-family homes, according to Mr. Miller, and an almost 38 percent drop in new listings.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the South Shore of Long Island, there’s about a month’s supply of available homes, or even less, in some areas, agents say. “We would normally have five to six months’ worth at any one time,” said Seth Pitlake, an agent at <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span> in Merrick. “It’s not that inventory is not increasing,” he said, “it’s just that anything that comes out in the market is being scooped up.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pitlake’s clients, Tom and Alicia Monforte, both in their early 30s, witnessed these tight conditions as both seller and buyer. Their Great Neck co-op sold in a week, but when they began searching for a larger property farther east, in Bellmore, they found themselves in a crowded field of purchasers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We would put in an offer only to find out someone else offered $40,000 over the asking price,” said Ms. Monforte, a clinical social worker, adding that “every free moment was devoted to looking.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple recently found a house at the end of a long day of hunting. “It was the last house we looked at out of seven,” Ms. Monforte said. The home — a 2,200-square-foot, five-bedroom high ranch with a $649,000 price tag — had just been re-listed after a previous deal fell through. “After five minutes we knew,” she said, “and in two hours we put in an offer for the full ask that was accepted.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similar scenarios of stiff competition are playing out on the North Shore. Mr. Pitlake’s Roslyn colleague at <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>, Maria Babaev, who specializes in the so-called Gold Coast, recently listed a five-bedroom, split-level in Roslyn Pines that “needs lots of work.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In just one showing, she said, “I had 27 groups of buyers coming in and received eight offers, three above asking.” The winning bid: 10 percent above the $999,000 list price. Ms. Babaev said more expensive homes were selling faster than usual, though she was quick to add that all property types needed to be competitively priced to garner any interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And what do buyers want? “They want green space,” said James Gavin, an agent with Laffey Real Estate in Manhasset, “and a lot are asking for a home office and then a pool.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Connecticut</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Fairfield County, towns that struggled with flat sales a year ago have seen major bounces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are also far fewer houses to go around than at any time since the pandemic began, which is starting to cut into sales volume, according to <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>. In February, there were 510 signed contracts, versus 623 in February 2020. Greenwich, though, has posted huge gains in the new year: February saw 108 signed deals as compared with 42 a year ago, according to Elliman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gains were perhaps expected south of the Merritt Parkway, whose popularity derives in part from regular train service. Indeed, in the past two months, Westport saw 33 sales of single-family homes priced from $1 million to $2.5 million, compared with 19 sales last winter, according to William Pitt Sotheby’s International Realty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But points north were strong as well. Ridgefield had 18 similar sales, according to <span class="companylink">Sotheby’s</span>, up from six, and New Canaan had 55, up from 11; countywide, there is almost no difference between list and closing prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as potential sellers cancel plans to downsize because of suddenly back-at-home children or over worries about finding new homes, supply has been crimped, and the steady stream of New Yorkers searching for homes into the county have created cutthroat conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Briefcases full of cash are coming in. It’s been crazy,” said Alex Ramsey, 38, a financial-services worker who for the past year has been trying to relocate his family from their four-bedroom house in Stamford to a five-bedroom in either Westport or New Canaan. One house they liked had 45 showings in two days, Mr. Ramsey said, “and a line of cars with New York plates filling the cul-de-sac.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Six of Mr. Ramsey’s offers have been rebuffed so far, with the most recent in January, when he failed to connect on a Westport house despite offering a 10 percent premium: “There seems to be so much irrational behavior.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year ago, the Noroton Heights section of Darien had 67 active listings but there are only 17 today, said Sara Littlefield, a Coldwell Banker agent, who canceled an open house for a shingle-sided 1950s five-bedroom, listed $1.595 million, because she got four offers beforehand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pre-Covid, buyers asked to be 10 minutes from train stations. But now, because they don’t have to be in the office as much, if at all, that requirement is moot. “Working from home is the future,” Ms. Littlefield said, “and a lot of people seem OK with it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet even as buyers are acting quickly, speed can lead to problems. Susan Klein, and her husband, Noah, retired residents of White Plains, N.Y., had their hearts set on Westport when they began looking last June. After two failed purchases, they swooped in last month with an all-cash offer for a four-bedroom house, listed for $1.749 million. And it seemed to do the trick; a contract was in the works.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a rushed title search missed problems, and on Feb. 24, the Kleins walked away. (The seller upped the price to $1.849 million a day later.) “This frenetic market forces you to make very quick decisions,” Ms. Klein said, “which you may need to change.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> released its twice-annual monetary policy report to Congress on Friday, offering an assessment of the economy that was at once hopeful and cautious as vaccines stoke the prospects of an economic recovery, but risks crowd the horizon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''While unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus and a relaxation of rigorous social-distancing restrictions supported a rapid rebound in the U.S. labor market last summer, the pace of gains has slowed and employment remains well below pre-pandemic levels,'' the central bank said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed used the missive to underline the uneven economic costs of the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Job losses last spring were disproportionately severe among lower wage workers, less-educated workers, and racial and ethnic minorities, as in previous recessions, but also among women, in contrast to previous recessions,'' the Fed noted.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Renault, a French carmaker, reported a loss of 8 billion euros, or $9.7 billion, in 2020 as the pandemic gutted sales, but the company said that it was profitable in the later part of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the annual loss stemmed from Renault's stake in its troubled partner, <span class="companylink">Nissan</span>. Losses at the Japanese carmaker drained €5 billion from the bottom line, Renault said. In addition, Renault car sales plunged 20 percent for the year, to just short of three million vehicles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''After a first half impacted by Covid-19, the group has significantly turned around its performance in the second half,'' Luca de Meo, Renault's chief executive, said in a statement, without giving a figure. He said that 2021 was ''set to be difficult given the unknowns regarding the health crisis as well as electronic components supply shortages.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2021, shortages of semiconductors, a problem for almost all carmakers, could cut production by as much as 100,000 vehicles, Renault said. JACK EWING</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously occupied homes in the United States rose again last month, a sign that the housing market's strong momentum from 2020 may be carrying over into this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales rose 0.6 percent in January from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted rate of 6.69 million annualized units, the National Association of Realtors said on Friday. Sales jumped 23.7 percent from a year earlier.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Hamptons Home Prices Soared During the Pandemic</span>
</div><div class="author">By Sydney Franklin </div><div>808 words</div><div>7 February 2021</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2021 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sale price rose by 40 percent in 2020, while the volume of sales increased 37 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As New York City's real estate market foundered during the pandemic in 2020, home sales in the Hamptons boomed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It began with a rush for spring rentals. New Yorkers sought beach access and airy quarters months earlier than they had in previous years. Then, as the weather warmed, many of those renters, who were paying exorbitant monthly prices, began to buy. Others joined them, and the buying spree continued through the fall and winter, as the housing supply on the East End of Long Island dwindled and prices climbed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales in the Hamptons rose annually at the highest rate in a decade, according to a new report from <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>. For the year 2020, the median sale price hit $1,202,500, a 40 percent increase from 2019 and the first time the year-end price broke the million-dollar threshold. The number of sales for the year rose by 37 percent, to 2,186, compared with 1,597 in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Record-low mortgage rates have enabled buyers to pay inflated home prices, and many Manhattan office workers who have spent the pandemic working from homes on the East End have helped turn the Hamptons and the North Fork into year-round communities, at least for now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The East End has, to a large degree, been the beneficiary of the challenges faced in the city,'' said Jonathan Miller, an appraiser and the author of the year-end report. ''This region is having its day.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Manhattan, agents and sellers have suffered through a grim year, seeing only glimmers of a recovery. The ban on showings early in the pandemic shut down the market, which did not rebound to 2019 levels when it opened back up. More than 400,000 New Yorkers left the city last spring to wait out the pandemic elsewhere, and many extended their plans to stay away from New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Hamptons, sales and prices broke records even in the usually sleepy months at the end of the year. In the fourth quarter, sales more than doubled compared with the year before, with 803 sales, according to the <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span> report, and the median home price increased by 55 percent, to $1.4 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price uptick, however, is less about rising prices in the overall market and more about strong sales activity at the high end, Mr. Miller said, as affluent New Yorkers and other buyers who fled to the East End of Long Island paid prices that took the high end to new heights. Corcoran reported that the number of sales in the Hamptons over $5 million nearly tripled in the fourth quarter, and the median sale price for the luxury market -- defined as the top 10 percent of sales -- rose 12 percent, to $7.2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One result of all this activity: a decreasing supply across the market. The number of listings dropped 9 percent, to 1,745, versus 1,919 in the same period last year, according to <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market on the North Fork, where home prices are lower, performed similarly. In 2020, the median sale price there increased by 24 percent, to $805,000, while inventory shrank by 61 percent from 2019, to 136 listings.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sale price rose by 40 percent in 2020, while the volume of sales increased 37 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As New York City’s real estate market foundered during the pandemic in 2020, home sales in the Hamptons boomed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It began with a rush for spring rentals. New Yorkers sought beach access and airy quarters months earlier than they had in previous years. Then, as the weather warmed, many of those renters, who were paying exorbitant monthly prices, began to buy. Others joined them, and the buying spree continued through the fall and winter, as the housing supply on the East End of Long Island dwindled and prices climbed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales in the Hamptons rose annually at the highest rate in a decade, according to a new report from <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>. For the year 2020, the median sale price hit $1,202,500, a 40 percent increase from 2019 and the first time the year-end price broke the million-dollar threshold. The number of sales for the year rose by 37 percent, to 2,186, compared with 1,597 in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Record-low mortgage rates have enabled buyers to pay inflated home prices, and many Manhattan office workers who have spent the pandemic working from homes on the East End have helped turn the Hamptons and the North Fork into year-round communities, at least for now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The East End has, to a large degree, been the beneficiary of the challenges faced in the city,” said Jonathan Miller, an appraiser and the author of the year-end report. “This region is having its day.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Manhattan, agents and sellers have suffered through a grim year, seeing only glimmers of a recovery. The ban on showings early in the pandemic shut down the market, which did not rebound to 2019 levels when it opened back up. More than 400,000 New Yorkers[https://www-nytimes-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/interactive/2020/05/15/upshot/who-left-new-york-coronavirus.html] left the city last spring to wait out the pandemic elsewhere, and many extended their plans to stay away from New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Hamptons, sales and prices broke records even in the usually sleepy months at the end of the year. In the fourth quarter, sales more than doubled compared with the year before, with 803 sales, according to the <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span> report, and the median home price increased by 55 percent, to $1.4 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price uptick, however, is less about rising prices in the overall market and more about strong sales activity at the high end, Mr. Miller said, as affluent New Yorkers and other buyers who fled to the East End of Long Island paid prices that took the high end to new heights. Corcoran reported that the number of sales in the Hamptons over $5 million nearly tripled in the fourth quarter, and the median sale price for the luxury market — defined as the top 10 percent of sales — rose 12 percent, to $7.2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One result of all this activity: a decreasing supply across the market. The number of listings dropped 9 percent, to 1,745, versus 1,919 in the same period last year, according to <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market on the North Fork, where home prices are lower, performed similarly. In 2020, the median sale price there increased by 24 percent, to $805,000, while inventory shrank by 61 percent from 2019, to 136 listings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts and brokers alike are questioning whether this level of activity is sustainable. Low mortgage rates are likely to hold for the time being, but the future of commuting is less clear. As vaccinations become available, companies are weighing options to reopen offices to workers in 2021. Still, the virus has been unpredictable, and working from home has become a way of life for many.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Nelson, the executive managing director in the Hamptons for Brown Harris Stevens, said that although the initial pandemic rush to buy is over, “it still seems like the people who had long-term plans to secure a Hamptons home are just bringing their timelines up by a few years.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent report finds that home prices rose 14 percent nationally over a year. But not all markets are created equal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The coronavirus pandemic hasn't just created massive unemployment and economic hardships for millions, it has also inflated real estate prices across the country. A recent report by Redfin found that the national median home price climbed to $335,519 in November, 14 percent higher than a year earlier -- the biggest annual gain since July 2013. A record 35 percent of homes sold for over asking price, and sales were swift, with homes averaging just 27 days on the market, a record low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median home prices rose in all 85 of the large markets (population 750,000 or more) that Redfin tracks. This week's chart shows the 20 markets where the prices changed the most. (Some markets are named for the major cities they encompass and incorporate surrounding commuter areas. Others are defined more broadly, like the Nassau County, N.Y., market.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was already hard enough for buyers on the lower end of the economic ladder to save for a down payment and afford a mortgage. But in 2020 it got even harder, because it was in lower-priced markets that sale prices tended to increase the most. Among the 20 markets with the greatest increases during November, 14 had prices below the national median. Meanwhile, San Francisco, the most expensive market (median sale price $1.4 million), had the smallest increase among the cities Redfin tracks, just 1.8 percent over a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that doesn't mean expensive markets weren't competitive. In Oakland, Calif., 20th on our list, more than 71 percent of homes sold for over asking in November, with a median sale price of $840,000, representing a 17 percent year-over-year increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are brokers getting rich off commissions from selling all these high-priced homes? Not likely, because there aren't that many to sell: Among all the markets in the study, supply was 23 percent lower in November than a year earlier, the lowest level on record for the month.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LABOR POLICY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Rule Would Let Employers Spread Tips</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department has released a rule that would allow employers to share workers' tips with co-workers who don't normally receive tips. Under the so-called tip pools authorized by the rule, the tips of waiters and waitresses can be shared with workers like cooks and dishwashers. But such sharing will be allowed only if the waiters and waitresses receive the standard minimum wage in their city or state, not the lower minimum wage that most states allow employers to pay tipped workers. The rule carries out a compromise negotiated between Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, and R. Alexander Acosta, then the labor secretary, that was enacted in legislation in 2018. Before the compromise, a Labor Department proposal for creating tip pools would have allowed supervisors, managers and owners to share in workers' tips. The compromise prohibited this practice.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home Sales in U.S. Fell Sharply in November</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new single-family homes in the United States fell more than expected in November, but the housing market remains underpinned by historically low mortgage rates. New home sales tumbled 11.0 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 841,000 units last month, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. October's sales pace was revised down to 945,000 units from the previously reported 999,000 units. New home sales jumped 20.8 percent on a year-on-year basis. The government reported last week that single-family home building, the largest share of the housing market, rose in November to the highest level since April 2007. But persistent shortages of land, materials and skilled labor are raising construction costs for builders. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is around an average of 2.67 percent, according to data from mortgage finance agency <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. REUTERS</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rise of 0.9 Percent For Big-Ticket Items</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders to American factories for big-ticket manufactured goods rose a moderate 0.9 percent in November. The gain in orders followed stronger gains in recent months including a 3.8 percent rise in October, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. A key category that serves as a proxy for business investment spending rose a modest 0.4 percent in November following gains of 3.6 percent in October and 3.9 percent in September. Analysts are concerned that business investment could begin to fade if the resurgence of the coronavirus curtails demand. The strength in November included a 3.4 percent rise in demand for vehicles and parts. Over all, orders for transportation equipment rose by 1.9 percent. Demand for commercial aircraft fell by 2.9 percent as the airline industry continued to be battered by a slump in travel due to the pandemic. ASSOCIATED PRESS</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One long-lasting result of the pandemic may be innovations that make home buying faster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ever since the housing market has emerged from its pandemic-driven freeze in late spring, there has been a frenzy of home buying and a sharp rise in prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The common explanation is that the pandemic has swollen the ranks of those who need more private space for work and play and safety, typically farther from urban centers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But why has that translated into fast-rising home prices all around? After all, if buying a new home means leaving behind an old one -- an equal contribution to supply and demand -- then what's disturbing the market balance and driving up prices?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A number of factors are at work. Some are well known, and others -- like innovations that speed up home buying -- have been less noticed and seem as if they may last.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates are low and continue to fall, increasing buying power and helping to fuel housing price growth. But the rates can explain only so much. The current episode of declining mortgage rates began in late 2018 and has been gradual, whereas the current frenzy began in late spring with a jolt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is also a relative dearth of homes for sale. Despite a recent increase in new listings that helps compensate for the big drop in the spring, the flow of new listings is still lower than that of previous years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, the pandemic has increased second-home buying and has crucially brought more first-time buyers into the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Typically, 55 percent to 70 percent of American home buyers are selling one home and buying another, with the remainder buying a home for the first time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the spring, the share of first-time buyers in the housing market has risen sharply. Unlike repeat buyers -- who contribute equally to demand and supply -- first-time buyers contribute only to demand. The share of first-timers, which hovered around 31 percent in 2018 and 2019, increased to about 34 percent during the spring and summer of 2020, according to a National Association of Realtors survey report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One effect of the pandemic has been to prompt many renters to make the leap into home buying. To some extent, that's because the U.S. housing market traditionally associates multifamily housing with rentals, and single-family homes with homeownership (despite recent trends to the contrary), leaving those who want more private space fewer options except buying a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That accelerated departure from the rental market of home buyers has contributed to a softening of rental prices throughout the nation (as has the consolidation of households as renters move in with friends and relatives). The impact on rents is especially marked in urban areas like San Francisco and New York, where the proximity to jobs and amenities like theaters or museums that normally justifies a high price has lost relevance during the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But perhaps the most important factor is the sheer rise in volume of buyers. Adding more buyers and sellers can generate frenzy all on its own, even without altering their balance. Home buyers flock to homes unequally, converging upon the most attractive ones, and in a thicker market that means this subset of homes draws far more buyers than before. (A market grows ''thicker'' when it has more participants on both sides, while holding their proportion fixed.) The experience of heightened competition around those homes affects perceptions. And when that culminates in higher sales prices, those sales serve as ''comparables,'' which inform asking prices on subsequent listings (including less attractive ones), lifting housing prices more quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But another explanation for the current buying boom has so far largely escaped attention. Thanks to innovation, the housing market is operating faster than it used to, and that has helped make supply and demand imbalances more extreme.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's how it works. Suppose that for every two sellers in the market, there are three buyers. In other words, the market is a hot one, dominated by sellers. Accelerating the pace at which buyers and sellers successfully pair up and exit the market reduces the number of buyers and sellers equally, and can be thought of as leaving two buyers for every one seller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because that ratio of two to one is even more unbalanced than three to two, it implies more intense competition over homes for sale. (The opposite would be true in a buyers' market, in which faster matching of buyers and sellers would make buyers scarcer than before.) By helping speed up the home-buying process, innovations also reduce for-sale inventory and shorten the length of time homes are on the market. (In isolation, it also shortens the time buyers are in the market.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as technology for remote work has been available for years -- but has only now come into wide use because of the pandemic -- innovations in home sale transactions have been widely embraced only recently despite being around for a while.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those include substitutes for in-person visits like 3-D home tours, drone footage and virtual staging that lets viewers imagine how a space could be used. The innovations also include mundane but meaningful things like phone-based entry into homes for sale (no appointment necessary), or the availability of remote notary services, which streamline the transaction process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The key here is that such innovations are likely to make home buying faster. Showing a home virtually, for example, eliminates the delay imposed by the need for a weekend open house, and a remote online notary can save time when local ones are in short supply. Again, it's not that these innovations are necessarily new, but that they are now being taken up much more broadly than before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of these factors contribute to the buying frenzy, but some are likely to outlast others. The pursuit of private space because of health fears may last a good while, perhaps even for a few years, and a low-interest environment even longer. But neither is likely to be permanent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the pursuit of private space is driven by remote work and the need for office space in the home, there is a greater chance it will persist (though not at the shelter-in-place extreme).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But to the extent that innovations accelerating the home sale process are the culprit for a more extreme supply and demand imbalance, well, there's no turning back the clock on that.</p>

To some extent, that’s because the U.S. housing market traditionally associates multifamily housing[http://eyeonhousing.org/2020/11/multifamily-built-for-rent-share-96/] with rentals, and single-family homes[http://eyeonhousing.org/2020/11/single-family-built-for-rent-construction-expands/] with homeownership (despite recent trends to the contrary), leaving those who want more private space fewer options except buying a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That accelerated departure from the rental market of home buyers has contributed to a softening of rental prices[https://res.cloudinary.com/apartmentlist/image/fetch/t_renter_life_article/https:/images.ctfassets.net/jeox55pd4d8n/7I14UrHPmT9vsqARdAEtBE/006a816ab471ebfe811b7d08b45eee28/2020_11_natl_line_chart.png] throughout the nation (as has the consolidation of households as renters move in with friends and relatives). The impact on rents is especially marked[https://public.tableau.com/profile/apartment.list.research#!/vizhome/2020_11_mom_chg_map_extract/Dashboard1] in urban areas like San Francisco and New York, where the proximity to jobs and amenities like theaters or museums that normally justifies a high price has lost relevance during the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But perhaps the most important factor is the sheer rise in volume[https://www.mba.org/2020-press-releases/november/october-new-home-purchase-mortgage-applications-increased-329-percent] of buyers. Adding more buyers and sellers can generate frenzy all on its own, even without altering their balance. Home buyers flock to homes unequally, converging upon the most attractive ones, and in a thicker market that means this subset of homes draws far more buyers than before. (A market grows “thicker” when it has more participants on both sides, while holding their proportion fixed.) The experience of heightened competition around those homes affects perceptions. And when that culminates in higher sales prices, those sales serve as “comparables,” which inform asking prices on subsequent listings (including less attractive ones), lifting housing prices more quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But another explanation for the current buying boom has so far largely escaped attention. Thanks to innovation, the housing market is operating faster than it used to, and that has helped make supply and demand imbalances more extreme.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here’s how it works. Suppose that for every two sellers in the market, there are three buyers. In other words, the market is a hot one, dominated by sellers. Accelerating the pace at which buyers and sellers successfully pair up and exit the market reduces the number of buyers and sellers equally, and can be thought of as leaving two buyers for every one seller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because that ratio of two to one is even more unbalanced than three to two, it implies more intense competition over homes for sale. (The opposite would be true in a buyers’ market, in which faster matching of buyers and sellers would make buyers scarcer than before.) By helping speed up the home-buying process, innovations also reduce for-sale inventory and shorten the length of time homes are on the market[https://cdn.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/styles/inline_paragraph_image/public/economists-outlook-buyer-competition-october-2015-to-july-2020-line-graph-10-27-2020-724w-436h.png?itok=_2-L62P2]. (In isolation, it also shortens the time buyers are in the market.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as technology for remote work has been available for years — but has only now come into wide use because of the pandemic — innovations in home sale transactions have been widely embraced only recently despite being around for a while.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those include substitutes for in-person visits like 3-D home tours[https://www.zillow.com/z/3d-home/], drone footage[https://dronebase.com/industries/rre] and virtual staging[https://virtualstagingsolutions.com/] that lets viewers imagine how a space could be used. The innovations also include mundane but meaningful things like phone-based entry[https://www.opendoor.com/w/faq/how-to-get-into-an-opendoor-home] into homes for sale (no appointment necessary), or the availability of remote notary services[https://www.notarize.com/], which streamline the transaction process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The key here is that such innovations are likely to make home buying faster. Showing a home virtually, for example, eliminates the delay imposed by the need for a weekend open house, and a remote online notary can save time when local ones are in short supply. Again, it’s not that these innovations are necessarily new, but that they are now being taken up much more broadly than before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of these factors contribute to the buying frenzy, but some are likely to outlast others. The pursuit of private space because of health fears may last a good while, perhaps even for a few years, and a low-interest environment even longer. But neither is likely to be permanent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the pursuit of private space is driven by remote work and the need for office space in the home, there is a greater chance it will persist (though not at the shelter-in-place extreme).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But to the extent that innovations accelerating the home sale process are the culprit for a more extreme supply and demand imbalance, well, there’s no turning back the clock on that.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Debra Kamin </div><div>621 words</div><div>30 November 2020</div><div>10:00</div><div>NYTimes.com Feed</div><div>NYTFEED</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2020. The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pandemic paused the housing market for a few months, but it has been on a rebound that has pushed the median price over $700,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fueled by low interest rates and a historic housing shortage, California[https://www-nytimes-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/2020/12/08/us/stay-at-home-california-order.html]’s median home price in September reached $712,430, closing out four straight months of record highs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The state’s housing market briefly cooled in the early months in the coronavirus pandemic, but by June, they were fully on the rebound, with the median sales price reaching $626,200, the highest ever at the time, according to a report from the <span class="companylink">California Department of Finance</span>. For the next three months, as mortgage rates stayed below 3 percent and many buyers looked to upgrade to larger homes, that number would continue to climb. In August, it exceeded $700,000 for the first time in history.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“A lot of people think the pandemic equals the market is suffering, but that’s just not the case,” said Ryan Lundquist, an appraiser based in Sacramento. “It’s the perfect storm of low rates, a housing shortage that we already had and is getting worse, plus heightened demand.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There has been much talk of the exodus[https://www-nytimes-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/2020/03/15/business/economy/arizona-economy-primary.html] triggered by California’s inflated cost of living, which has seen Californians trickle outward to states with a lower cost of living — states like Texas, Nevada, and Arizona — for more than a decade. But while the state did lose 650,000 residents last year, “We have 39 million people here,” Mr. Lundquist said. “It’s a drop in the bucket compared to how many people are here, and builders haven’t been able to build fast enough to satisfy our population.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those builders also haven’t been able to — or haven’t chosen to — build the kind of properties that the majority of the population needs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“New home construction skews luxury. We aren’t building enough affordable new homes,” said Jonathan Miller, of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel. “Most of the sales growth in single family homes in California is above the $600,000 mark. When it comes to inventory, there is more lost in affordable and modest-priced housing, year over year, than in the upper-level housing market.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Los Angeles alone, the contraction of the lower end of the condominium market speaks volumes. Condos priced above $500,000 are flooding the market; those priced below are becoming significantly more scarce. It’s a trend, Mr. Miller said, that isn’t unique to California, but is more pronounced there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“California is a proxy for what we’re seeing nationally,” he said. “Since the pandemic, the action has been on the higher end. And that makes sense because the unemployment picture is heavily skewed against lower wage earners, which tend to be starter-home buyers, or renters.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has been a whiplash year for the Golden State, where the pandemic pushed unemployment numbers to a staggering 16.4 percent in April. By October, however, employers had added 145,500 jobs — the third-highest single-month job gain since 1990 — and the unemployment rate dropped down below 10 percent for the first time since the pandemic began. The median home price cooled slightly in October, as well, slipping 0.2 percent to $711,300.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such small adjustments are not enough, Mr. Miller said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The housing market needs disruption,” he said. “This cocktail of mortgage rates below 3 percent and some of the lowest inventory rates in history is reducing the affordability of housing at an alarming rate. This picture is not sustainable.”</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">In a Sweet Spot, and Relatively Affordable, Too</span>
</div><div class="author">By Jill P. Capuzzo </div><div>1670 words</div><div>29 November 2020</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2020 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Best known as the home of Six Flags Great Adventure, this Ocean County township is drawing new residents with its relatively affordable home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like so many New Yorkers who have recently fled the city, Luis and Evelyn Torres had been thinking about selling their home, a condominium in Queens, but found their plans accelerated by the onslaught of the coronavirus. In May, the couple began looking at houses in New Jersey, starting in the northern part of the state and working their way south, until they landed in Jackson Township.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When we got to Jackson, we knew, this is it,'' said Mr. Torres, 50, the owner of a trucking company in Manhattan. ''For what I'd pay for a house in Secaucus or Paramus, I'd get twice the size of house and two to three times the size of land here. And the commute would be just about the same.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After losing out on several houses in Jackson to other eager buyers, the Torreses paid $695,000 for a 4,017-square-foot, five-bedroom house on 1.36 acres -- with what Mr. Torres described as ''the biggest pool you can get'' -- and they moved in last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A once largely rural area known for its cranberry bogs, sawmills and chicken farms, Jackson Township has seen much recent growth, from large single-family housing developments to new apartment and condo complexes, as well as major commercial projects along the main arteries. Being equidistant from New York City and Philadelphia, and about 30 minutes from the Jersey Shore, this sprawling northern Ocean County township is now home to 61,914 residents, having added close to 20,000 people in the past 20 years, according to U.S. census figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're no longer the quiet, sleepy community we once were,'' said Michael Kafton, 55, the broker-owner of Exit Realty and a lifelong resident, who described the flurry of activity as ''change for the better.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with families like the Torreses seeking more space, the relatively affordable Jackson appeals to first-time home buyers, as well as renters and retirees. In the first category is Ilona Gliszczynski, 27, an accountant who moved out of her parents' house in Woodbridge, N.J., last month and into a 1993 four-bedroom bi-level house that she and her boyfriend bought for $372,000. Soon after moving in, the couple got engaged. ''He was waiting for us to get the house, and then he proposed,'' Ms. Gliszczynski said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the other end of the spectrum is Diane Bravata. After retiring from the investment management team at the <span class="companylink">Bank of New York</span> three years ago, she wanted to be closer to her two daughters who were living in New Jersey. So she set off on a grand tour of about two dozen adult communities in New Jersey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April of last year, Ms. Bravata settled on Westlake Golf and Country Club, one of Jackson's four 55-plus communities, buying a 2,800-square-foot, three-bedroom house built in 2002, for $398,000. Although not much of a golfer, she said she liked the country club's amenities. Since moving, she and her husband, Peppi Colangelo, have joined a close-knit group of couples that Ms. Bravata referred to as ''the Westlake troublemakers.'' Together, they eat at local restaurants and hang out by the pool. Before Covid hit, they attended concerts and dinner dances in Westlake's ballroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everybody's from New York or Brooklyn, so we all have the same kind of vibe,'' said Ms. Bravata, 64, referring to their friends in this community of more than 1,400 homes. ''It's a good fit.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What You'll Find</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At just over 100 square miles, Jackson Township is New Jersey's third largest municipality, with a combination of sparsely populated pine forests and more dense residential developments. The oldest of these large residential neighborhoods is Brookwood. Built in four phases in the 1960s and 1970s, it comprises more than 2,000 modest split-level and bi-level homes. Larger and newer houses on more than an acre can be found in areas with names like Belaire Estates. Houses on Jackson's more populated east side have access to public water and sewer lines, while most properties on the west side have wells and septic tanks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to its four 55-plus communities, Jackson has six mobile-home parks and several condominium and rental complexes, the newest being the Gardens at Jackson Twenty-One, named for the project's location near exit 21 of Interstate 195, which cuts across the top of Jackson. The Gardens and the adjacent affordable-housing project known as the Ponds are the first two phases of an expansive mixed-use project that has been in the planning stages for many years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of Jackson's oldest homes are found in what some refer to as the ''Piney area,'' where houses tucked into the woods displayed an abundance of Trump campaign signs in late October. (Jackson Township, like the county it sits in, has favored Republican candidates by about two to one in recent elections.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past few years, Hasidic families from New York and neighboring Lakewood, N.J., have been gravitating to sections of Jackson that border Lakewood. Jackson is currently facing a discrimination lawsuit from the <span class="companylink">U.S. Department of Justice</span> alleging violations of the Religious Land Use and Fair Housing acts, after blocking the proposed building of a Yeshiva school dormitory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What You'll Pay</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The range of prices in Jackson is about as wide as the array of housing options, from a 2019 seven-bedroom Craftsman-style house on three acres currently listed for $1,699,999 to a 1972 two-bedroom mobile home for $28,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While prices are creeping up, ''there's still tremendous value here,'' said James J. Befarah, an agent with <span class="companylink">Berkshire Hathaway</span>, especially relative to neighboring towns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In mid-November, there were 172 homes on the market, including 140 single-family homes, 24 adult community homes and eight condominiums. The average sale price of homes from January through Nov. 10 of this year was $386,500, up from $358,000 during the same period in 2019, according to the Monmouth Ocean County Multiple Listing Service. The recent uptick can be seen in sales figures from the 60-day period from Sept. 10 to Nov. 10, when the average price jumped to $435,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rental apartments range from $1,225 a month for a two-bedroom apartment at an older complex like Jackson Colonial Arms, to around $1,945 for a two-bedroom unit at the Gardens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Vibe</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonresidents mostly know Jackson Township as the home of the Six Flags Great Adventure amusement park. Opened in 1974, it has since added a water park and a safari adventure, and now occupies 510 acres, making it one of the largest theme parks in the world. Many residents buy discounted season passes to take advantage of the park during less busy weekdays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jackson Premium Outlets also draw visitors from throughout the region, with outlet stores of dozens of national retail chains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seeking to appeal to those who travel to the two attractions, a local developer is now clearing 300 acres adjacent to Great Adventure to build Adventure Crossing, which is expected to include hotels, indoor and outdoor sports and entertainment arenas, restaurants and shops, plus a brain-research center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elsewhere in town, Jackson has three golf courses and numerous public parks and nature preserves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Schools</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jackson Township has six elementary schools, two middle schools and two public high schools.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the 2018-19 school year, Jackson Liberty High School had 1,131 students, and Jackson Memorial High School had 1,584 students. Average SAT scores at Jackson Liberty that year were 531 in math and 539 in reading and writing; at Jackson Memorial, the averages were 559 in math and 552 in reading and writing. (State averages were 541 in math and 539 in reading and writing.) Both schools offer more than 16 Advanced Placement courses. Jackson Memorial also has a Career Academy program, with tracks in STEM (science, technology, engineering and math), digital media, business, and visual and performing arts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private school options include Mother Seton Academy, a Catholic school in Howell, N.J., that serves students from preschool through eighth grade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commute</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jackson Township is about 70 miles south of New York City, with a drive time of about an hour and a half. The Jackson Park and Ride commuter bus terminal, just off exit 21 of I-195, offers free parking to Jackson residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bus service to the <span class="companylink">Port Authority</span> terminal in Manhattan is provided by Academy Bus; the trip takes about an hour and 40 minutes and costs $19 one way or $410 for a monthly pass. A <span class="companylink">New Jersey Transit</span> bus travels from farther south in Jackson, along Route 528, to <span class="companylink">Port Authority</span>, but requires changing buses in Lakewood; it takes two hours and 39 minutes, and one-way tickets cost $21.75.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The History</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cultivation and commercialization of cranberries has been credited to John Webb, a retired seaman turned schoolteacher known as Peg Leg, who sought to supply the vitamin-rich fruit to Philadelphia sailing masters hoping to avoid diseases on long voyages in the 19th century. Webb created a method for controlling water flow at his cranberry bogs and invented a sorting machine for ripe berries, both of which helped produce greater yields. A thriving industry was born, with Jackson once home to 260 cranberry bogs and related processing, packaging and shipping operations.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An industry measure of booked showings paints a picture of the real estate market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We've measured the pandemic's effects on the real estate market by examining where renters and buyers find the most indoor space, by counting adults moving back home with their parents, by tracking late housing payments, by revealing pandemic home design trends, and by looking at the supply (low) and demand (high) that has created a seller's market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ShowingTime Showing Index measures demand another way: by comparing the number of booked appointments for virtual or in-person showings to the number of properties available. It's a forward-looking index, explained Michael Lane, president of ShowingTime. ''There aren't that many that are giving you a feel for what's happening for upcoming sales.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index uses January 2014 showings as a baseline set at a score of 100, so a score of 150 would indicate a 50 percent increase over 2014's rate of showings. The more views per property, the higher the index rises.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week's chart, outlining the past eight months of showing data, confirms the recent spike in demand for new homes, with a dip in showings during the spring counteracted by a huge upswing as summer turned to fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, when the pandemic began halting showings altogether in many areas, the national index slipped to 128 from 157 in March 2019, an 18 percent drop. In April, it plunged 42 percent year over year, from 147 to 85.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By September, the index had roared back with a score of 185, up from 112 last September -- a 64 percent increase and the greatest year-over-year jump recorded since ShowingTime began the index in January 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The figures below are drawn from ShowingTime's scheduling products, which are used to book home showings by many of the major brokerages including Coldwell Banker, <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span>, Century 21, <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>, Compass, Redfin and others. In September, about seven million showings were booked nationally, raising the total for 2020 to just over 60 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the rebound is good for sellers and brokers who make those sales, for buyers it's a further illustration of how challenging it is to buy a home today. There just aren't enough to go around.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government efforts to stimulate growth are lifting markets of all kinds everywhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many Americans will have heard stories about people fearful of the pandemic fleeing from crowded cities and driving up home prices in the rest of the country. But there is a much bigger tale to tell here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing prices started rising before the pandemic arrived. They are rising on average in U.S. cities as well as in rural and suburban areas. They are increasing not just in the United States but also worldwide, regardless of how hard a country has been hit by the pandemic. And prices are at or near record highs not only for housing but also, despite recent market wobbles, for stocks and bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a global market boom in the price of … everything.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The common factor is not the virus; it is so-called easy money. Led by the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> in the United States, central banks have been lowering interest rates for decades, hoping to stimulate economic growth, but much of that newly issued money keeps flowing into financial markets. This unintended boost has accelerated drastically during the pandemic, as central banks roll out multi-trillion-dollar stimulus plans. According to my research, the valuations of stocks, bonds and housing have risen sharply this year to levels seen only around 2000 and 2008 — periods characterized by financial bubbles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not good news for most people. Market manias have an alarming record of bringing down the wider economy and of widening wealth inequality. In 484 cities around the world whose home prices are tracked by Numbeo[https://www.numbeo.com/property-investment/rankings_current.jsp], which compiles user-generated data about consumer prices, home prices are now beyond reach for the typical family in more than 400 of them. The least affordable U.S. city is New York, where median home prices (despite falling during the pandemic) are still more than 10 times the median annual income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Going back at least to the 1970s, housing had always slumped during recessions, both in the United States and worldwide. People lose jobs and stop dreaming of bigger homes. But in the second quarter this year, amid the worst global recession since the 1940s, housing prices were up a robust 4 percent worldwide, and that was before the boom really took off. Since May, new-home sales in the United States have climbed by 67 percent, and prices by 15 percent. The median price of existing homes in the United States recently passed $300,000[https://www.mansionglobal.com/articles/the-median-price-of-existing-homes-in-the-u-s-surpasses-300000-for-the-first-time-218663] for the first time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This surreal “boom in the gloom” is a government creation. As central banks flooded money into the credit markets, rates on 30-year mortgages, which had been falling for years, plummeted to record lows — under 3 percent in the United States and under 2 percent in Europe. If you are dreaming of riding out the pandemic in a larger home, cheap mortgages now beckon you to act.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, housing is a bright spot in a struggling economy. But when prices are shaped by easy money, as much or more than by genuine demand, the result is often a severely skewed allocation of resources. Already, many investors are buying homes not as a shelter but as an alternative to stocks and bonds, which are even pricier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The risk going forward is that the boom will leave more people unable to afford a home and that prices will eventually reach dangerous bubble levels. And when booms go bust, it takes time to unravel the bad debts, which ripple through the middle class, lengthening and deepening the resulting recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The response favored by many experts, including some Fed officials, is tighter regulation. But if regulators clamp down on mortgage lending, investors will borrow to buy something else — stocks and bonds, or even fine art, rare wines or some other exotic asset. When borrowing is nearly free, tweaking regulations will only shift money from one market to another.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years, central banks said there was no reason to tighten monetary policy because there was no inflation. But as many economists have argued, there appeared to be no inflation because official indexes don’t adequately capture asset prices. The United States, for example, includes only rent and a “rental equivalent” for home prices in its official indexes, which makes them increasingly misleading: Rents have lagged behind home prices for years and have slumped further during the pandemic, pushing the official inflation rate even lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Central banks need to take the menace of asset price inflation more seriously and to give the threat of stock, bond and especially housing bubbles more weight in their policy deliberations. This would not prevent central banks from bailing out an economy in crisis, when other concerns prevail. But once a recovery begins, it would nudge central bankers to start shutting off the easy money spigot a bit earlier than they otherwise would have — before an “everything boom” like this one becomes a full-blown bubble.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government efforts to stimulate growth are lifting markets of all kinds everywhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many Americans will have heard stories about people fearful of the pandemic fleeing from crowded cities and driving up home prices in the rest of the country. But there is a much bigger tale to tell here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing prices started rising before the pandemic arrived. They are rising on average in U.S. cities as well as in rural and suburban areas. They are increasing not just in the United States but also worldwide, regardless of how hard a country has been hit by the pandemic. And prices are at or near record highs not only for housing but also, despite recent market wobbles, for stocks and bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a global market boom in the price of … everything.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The common factor is not the virus; it is so-called easy money. Led by the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> in the United States, central banks have been lowering interest rates for decades, hoping to stimulate economic growth, but much of that newly issued money keeps flowing into financial markets. This unintended boost has accelerated drastically during the pandemic, as central banks roll out multi-trillion-dollar stimulus plans. According to my research, the valuations of stocks, bonds and housing have risen sharply this year to levels seen only around 2000 and 2008 — periods characterized by financial bubbles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not good news for most people. Market manias have an alarming record of bringing down the wider economy and of widening wealth inequality. In 484 cities around the world whose home prices are tracked by Numbeo[https://www.numbeo.com/property-investment/rankings_current.jsp], which compiles user-generated data about consumer prices, home prices are now beyond reach for the typical family in more than 400 of them. The least affordable U.S. city is New York, where median home prices (despite falling during the pandemic) are still more than 10 times the median annual income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Going back at least to the 1970s, housing had always slumped during recessions, both in the United States and worldwide. People lose jobs and stop dreaming of bigger homes. But in the second quarter this year, amid the worst global recession since the 1940s, housing prices were up a robust 4 percent worldwide, and that was before the boom really took off. Since May, new-home sales in the United States have climbed by 67 percent, and prices by 15 percent. The median price of existing homes in the United States recently passed $300,000[https://www.mansionglobal.com/articles/the-median-price-of-existing-homes-in-the-u-s-surpasses-300000-for-the-first-time-218663] for the first time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This surreal “boom in the gloom” is a government creation. As central banks flooded money into the credit markets, rates on 30-year mortgages, which had been falling for years, plummeted to record lows — under 3 percent in the United States and under 2 percent in Europe. If you are dreaming of riding out the pandemic in a larger home, cheap mortgages now beckon you to act.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales in areas most vulnerable to sea-level rise began falling around 2013, researchers found. Now, prices are following a similar downward path.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If rising seas cause America's coastal housing market to dive -- or, as many economists warn, when -- the beginning might look a little like what's happening in the tiny town of Bal Harbour, a glittering community on the northernmost tip of Miami Beach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With single-family homes selling for an average of $3.6 million, Bal Harbour epitomizes high-end Florida waterfront property. But around 2013, something started to change: The annual number of homes sales began to drop -- tumbling by half by 2018 -- a sign that fewer people wanted to buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices eventually followed, falling 7.6 percent from 2016 to 2020, according to data from Zillow, the real estate data company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All across Florida's low-lying areas, it's a similar story, according to research published Monday. The authors argue that not only is climate change eroding one of the most vibrant real estate markets in the country, it has quietly been doing so for nearly a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The downturn started in 2013, and no one noticed,'' said Benjamin Keys, the paper's lead author and a professor of real estate and finance at the <span class="companylink">University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School</span>. ''It means that coastal housing is in more distress than we thought.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The researchers identified a decline in sales in low-lying coastal areas beginning in 2013, followed a few years later by a drop in prices compared with safer areas. On less vulnerable land, sales and prices continued to grow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea that climate change will eventually ruin the value of coastal homes is neither new nor particularly controversial. In 2016, the then-chief economist for the federal mortgage giant Freddie Mac warned that rising seas ''appear likely to destroy billions of dollars in property and to displace millions of people.'' By 2045, more than 300,000 existing coastal homes will be at risk of flooding regularly, the <span class="companylink">Union of Concerned Scientists</span> concluded in 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question that has occupied researchers is how soon, and how quickly, people will respond to that risk by demanding price discounts or fleeing the market. Previous research has begun to tackle that question, showing that climate change, far from being a distant threat, is already starting to hurt real estate values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The paper released Monday by the <span class="companylink">National Bureau of Economic Research</span> takes a different approach; it focuses not on price declines, but instead tries to detect an earlier signal of trouble, a decline in the number of houses changing hands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Falling sales have been a reliable predictor of price drops in previous housing crashes. A drop in home values follow a common pattern. First, prospective buyers become reluctant to pay the price that sellers are asking. But sellers, not wanting to take a loss, often hold out for months or even years, before grudgingly starting to accept lower bids.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Keys, along with his co-author Philip Mulder, a doctoral student at Wharton, wondered if the same pattern could predict a climate-induced housing crash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To find out, the pair looked at Florida, with more miles of low-lying coastal land than any other state. Examining data for 1.4 million home sales over 20 years, they compared two types of coastal census tracts: Those on the most exposed land, where more than 70 percent of developed land is less than six feet above sea level, and also in higher areas, where less than 10 percent of developed land meets that criteria.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For most of that time, home sales in both areas rose in lock step, suggesting that buyers weren't particularly concerned about climate risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, starting in 2013, something started to change. While sales in safer areas kept climbing, sales in vulnerable ones began to fall. By 2018, the last year for which Dr. Keys and Mr. Mulder obtained data, sales in vulnerable areas trailed safer areas by 16 percent to 20 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few things happened around that time that might have made prospective home buyers more worried about climate risk, Dr. Keys said. An international report the previous year highlighted the risks of extreme weather events. After that report came out, <span class="companylink">Google</span> searches in Florida for ''sea level rise'' spiked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And people from the Northeast, who account for a significant portion of Florida home buyers, had just lived through Hurricane Sandy, which damaged some 650,000 homes and caused 8.5 million people to lose power, some for months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''After Sandy, all of a sudden, flood risk becomes a very salient thing'' for those buyers, Dr. Keys said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To check whether that drop in demand predicted a decline in prices, Dr. Keys and Mr. Mulder looked at a second set of data, from Zillow. They found that, since 2018, prices in high-risk markets have started to fall too, dropping by about 5 percent by 2020 compared with less vulnerable coastal census tracts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The large and growing gap in sales volume between safer and riskier areas, Dr. Keys said, suggests that the gap in prices over the past two years isn't just the normal boom-and-bust cycle of Florida real estate, but part of a longer trend, with prices likely to follow demand downward in risky areas. ''It tells us how fast this reality is approaching,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing experts who weren't involved in the new paper, when told of its conclusions, said that using sales volume to predict a change in prices was sound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The finding makes a lot of sense,'' Tingyu Zhou, an assistant professor of real estate at Florida State University, said by email. Asked what she thought explained the declining demand in high-risk areas, she agreed with the authors: ''I think the fundamental reason is the increase of home buyers' awareness of the risk.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market decline detected by Dr. Keys and Mr. Mulder appeared to be furthest along in the cycle in Miami-Dade County. There, prices in the most exposed towns aren't just growing more slowly than in safer areas, they're already falling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Key Biscayne, an island 20 minutes southeast of Miami where the average elevation is 3.4 feet above sea level, sales volume in 2018 was one-third below its 2012 peak, and the parts of the island most exposed to rising seas saw the greatest drop. In the town of Sunny Isles Beach, in the northeast corner of the county, one particularly low-lying census tract saw sales volume fall by two-thirds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2016, prices have fallen by 13 percent in Key Biscayne, and 9 percent in Sunny Isles Beach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mayors of each city took issue with the paper's findings. Some argued that the recent declines are part of the natural cycle of Florida real estate and that the market has shown signs of recovery in the past few months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">George ''Bud'' Scholl, the mayor of Sunny Isles Beach, said he didn't think climate concerns explained the drop in sales volume, which he attributed to families that have lived in the town for a long time and were ''simply holding onto their properties.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gabriel Groisman, the mayor of Bal Harbour, said the downturn in his city was caused by tighter federal rules that made it harder for wealthy foreign buyers to move money into the United States, as well as an uptick in new condominiums that pushed down prices. Climate change wasn't the problem, he said, at least not in his town.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't see that being a consideration,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Key Biscayne, Mayor Michael Davey said his city is addressing those concerns, seeking to elevate roads, protect beaches and bury power lines to avoid wind damage and power cuts as storms worsen. ''We're protecting our property value by doing these projects,'' Mr. Davey said. ''I don't think the sky is falling.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate agents were equally skeptical. Oren Alexander, a broker at <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman Real Estate</span> who sells what he called ''trophy properties'' around Miami, said every part of the country faces climate threats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Hurricanes have reached New York City. California is burning,'' Mr. Alexander said. ''I'll tell you firsthand from working with buyers, are they concerned with sea level rise? No.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the housing market around Miami can seem to occupy a separate universe from the rest of the country, Dr. Keys and Mr. Mulder ran the numbers a second time, this time excluding Miami-Dade County. They found the trend held for the rest of the state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the most exposed waterfront census tracts in Hallandale Beach, a town in Broward County, saw a 39 percent drop in sales between 2013 and 2018, while a nearby area fell 22 percent. Home prices seem to be following: Values increased every year since 2011, after the last housing crash, then dipped slightly for the first time this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend was similar in parts of the Florida Keys, including the northern portion of Key West and part of the city of Marathon. On the other side of Florida, a handful of coastal tracts in Collier County, including parts of Marco Island south of Naples, have shown the same one-two pattern of falling sales volume followed by a small dip in prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mayor Heather Carruthers of Monroe County, which encompasses the Keys, said the county's resilience efforts remain ''a top priority.'' Officials in Collier County declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mayor of Hallandale Beach, Joy Cooper, acknowledged the pressure that climate change is putting on property values, but said coastal cities like hers can engineer their way out of the problem, protecting homeowners from worsening storms and floods. ''We've been managing water for years,'' she said. ''So we know it can be done.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data tell a less optimistic story, Dr. Keys said: ''The market already perceives that these substantial infrastructure projects won't be successful.''</p>
<p>In places like Bal Harbour, Fla., waterfront homes may be losing their luster. (B1); Construction in Hallandale Beach, left. Sales in the Broward County town dropped by 39 percent between 2013 and 2018, and home prices are also down. A property on the market, right, in Miami Beach. Florida has more miles of low-lying coastal land than any other state, and sales there are falling.; Gabriel Groisman, mayor of Bal Harbour, top, doubted a climate change link.

But sellers, not wanting to take a loss, often hold out for months or even years, before grudgingly starting to accept lower bids.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Keys, along with his co-author Philip Mulder, a doctoral student at Wharton, wondered if the same pattern could predict a climate-induced housing crash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To find out, the pair looked at Florida, with more miles of low-lying coastal land than any other state. Examining data for 1.4 million home sales over 20 years, they compared two types of coastal census tracts: Those on the most exposed land, where more than 70 percent of developed land is less than six feet above sea level, and also in higher areas, where less than 10 percent of developed land meets that criteria.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For most of that time, home sales in both areas rose in lock step, suggesting that buyers weren’t particularly concerned about climate risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, starting in 2013, something started to change. While sales in safer areas kept climbing, sales in vulnerable ones began to fall. By 2018, the last year for which Dr. Keys and Mr. Mulder obtained data, sales in vulnerable areas trailed safer areas by 16 percent to 20 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few things happened around that time that might have made prospective home buyers more worried about climate risk, Dr. Keys said. An international report[https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/03/SREX_Full_Report-1.pdf] the previous year highlighted the risks of extreme weather events. After that report came out, <span class="companylink">Google</span> searches in Florida for “sea level rise” spiked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And people from the Northeast, who account for a significant portion of Florida home buyers, had just lived through Hurricane Sandy, which damaged some 650,000 homes[https://www-nhc-noaa-gov.proxy.library.brocku.ca/data/tcr/AL182012_Sandy.pdf] and caused 8.5 million people to lose power, some for months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“After Sandy, all of a sudden, flood risk becomes a very salient thing” for those buyers, Dr. Keys said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To check whether that drop in demand predicted a decline in prices, Dr. Keys and Mr. Mulder looked at a second set of data, from Zillow. They found that, since 2018, prices in high-risk markets have started to fall too, dropping by about 5 percent by 2020 compared with less vulnerable coastal census tracts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The large and growing gap in sales volume between safer and riskier areas, Dr. Keys said, suggests that the gap in prices over the past two years isn’t just the normal boom-and-bust cycle of Florida real estate, but part of a longer trend, with prices likely to follow demand downward in risky areas. “It tells us how fast this reality is approaching,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing experts who weren’t involved in the new paper, when told of its conclusions, said that using sales volume to predict a change in prices was sound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The finding makes a lot of sense,” Tingyu Zhou, an assistant professor of real estate at Florida State University, said by email. Asked what she thought explained the declining demand in high-risk areas, she agreed with the authors: “I think the fundamental reason is the increase of home buyers’ awareness of the risk.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market decline detected by Dr. Keys and Mr. Mulder appeared to be furthest along in the cycle in Miami-Dade County. There, prices in the most exposed towns aren’t just growing more slowly than in safer areas, they’re already falling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Key Biscayne, an island 20 minutes southeast of Miami where the average elevation is 3.4 feet above sea level[https://amp.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/key-biscayne/article245378270.html], sales volume in 2018 was one-third below its 2012 peak, and the parts of the island most exposed to rising seas saw the greatest drop. In the town of Sunny Isles Beach, in the northeast corner of the county, one particularly low-lying census tract saw sales volume fall by two-thirds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2016, prices have fallen by 13 percent in Key Biscayne, and 9 percent in Sunny Isles Beach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mayors of each city took issue with the paper’s findings. Some argued that the recent declines are part of the natural cycle of Florida real estate and that the market has shown signs of recovery in the past few months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">George “Bud” Scholl, the mayor of Sunny Isles Beach, said he didn’t think climate concerns explained the drop in sales volume, which he attributed to families that have lived in the town for a long time and were “simply holding onto their properties.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gabriel Groisman, the mayor of Bal Harbour, said the downturn in his city was caused by tighter federal rules that made it harder for wealthy foreign buyers to move money into the United States, as well as an uptick in new condominiums that pushed down prices. Climate change wasn’t the problem, he said, at least not in his town.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I don’t see that being a consideration,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Key Biscayne, Mayor Michael Davey said his city is addressing those concerns, seeking to elevate roads, protect beaches and bury power lines to avoid wind damage and power cuts as storms worsen. “We’re protecting our property value by doing these projects,” Mr. Davey said. “I don’t think the sky is falling.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate agents were equally skeptical. Oren Alexander, a broker at <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman Real Estate</span> who sells what he called “trophy properties” around Miami, said every part of the country faces climate threats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Hurricanes have reached New York City. California is burning,” Mr. Alexander said. “I’ll tell you firsthand from working with buyers, are they concerned with sea level rise? No.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the housing market around Miami can seem to occupy a separate universe from the rest of the country, Dr. Keys and Mr. Mulder ran the numbers a second time, this time excluding Miami-Dade County. They found the trend held for the rest of the state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the most exposed waterfront census tracts in Hallandale Beach, a town in Broward County, saw a 39 percent drop in sales between 2013 and 2018, while a nearby area fell 22 percent. Home prices seem to be following: Values increased every year since 2011, after the last housing crash, then dipped slightly for the first time this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend was similar in parts of the Florida Keys, including the northern portion of Key West and part of the city of Marathon. On the other side of Florida, a handful of coastal tracts in Collier County, including parts of Marco Island south of Naples, have shown the same one-two pattern of falling sales volume followed by a small dip in prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mayor Heather Carruthers of Monroe County, which encompasses the Keys, said the county’s resilience efforts remain “a top priority.” Officials in Collier County declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mayor of Hallandale Beach, Joy Cooper, acknowledged the pressure that climate change is putting on property values, but said coastal cities like hers can engineer their way out of the problem, protecting homeowners from worsening storms and floods. “We’ve been managing water for years,” she said. “So we know it can be done.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data tell a less optimistic story, Dr. Keys said: “The market already perceives that these substantial infrastructure projects won’t be successful.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a lawsuit, home sellers say that the current system is anticompetitive and that they overpaid. The Realtors association disagrees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer advocates have long criticized traditional real estate commissions as confusing and too high. Now, those commissions are coming under increasing legal pressure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A federal judge in Illinois ruled last week that a potential class-action lawsuit against the National Association of Realtors and four major brokerage companies could proceed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lawsuit, filed last year in Federal District Court in Chicago on behalf of several home sellers, alleges that the way brokerages charge commissions and run property databases called ''multiple listing services'' is anticompetitive and artificially inflates commission rates paid to real estate brokers. (A similar lawsuit filed in Missouri is also pending, after a federal judge declined last year to dismiss it.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mantill Williams, a spokesman for the Realtors association, which represents more than 1.3 million real estate professionals, said in an email that the trade group was ''disappointed'' in the ruling but was confident that it would prevail in the suit. As the case moves forward, he said, ''we intend to demonstrate how the M.L.S. system creates competitive, efficient markets that benefit home buyers and sellers as well as small business brokerages.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home buyers in many parts of the country are facing a strong sellers' market. A lack of houses for sale is pushing up prices, impeding first-time and lower-income buyers even as mortgage rates remain low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an order denying requests by the Realtors association and the brokerages to dismiss the suit, Judge Andrea R. Wood said the plaintiffs would have paid ''substantially lower'' commissions if not for the rules established by the Realtors association and followed by the brokerages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The suit takes aim at the way brokers who represent home buyers are paid. Typically, people seeking to sell their home agree to pay a listing agent a commission -- usually 5 to 6 percent of the sale price -- to place it on a listing service maintained by local Realtor groups and to market the home. The seller agrees that the listing agent will offer to split the commission -- say, a 2.5 percent share -- with the agent representing the buyer. (Agents may share part of their commissions with their brokerages.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home buyers pay nothing directly to their own agent and may believe they are paying no commission because, according to the lawsuit, the Realtors association allows buyers' agents to tell clients that their services are free.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In a competitive market,'' the suit says, ''the seller would pay nothing to the buyer broker, who would be paid instead by the buyer, and the commission paid by the seller would be set at a level to compensate the seller broker only.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In effect, the suit argues, the home seller is paying an inflated commission that is covering the buyer's share as well. By that analysis, a seller paying a 5 percent commission on the sale of a $500,000 home is overpaying by about $12,500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer advocates and some analysts say the practice pushes up home prices because the commission for the buyer's agent ends up being added to the asking price of the home so the seller can get a particular net price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The money comes out of somewhere,'' said Mark S. Nadel, a lawyer who has published research on broker practices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a report last year, the <span class="companylink">Consumer Federation of America</span> found that few people understood the commissions they paid when buying or selling a home, partly because most agents don't make it easy for consumers to learn about them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, the complaint says, buyers' agents can see, through the listing service, the commission split offered for each home -- but home buyers generally cannot. Buyers' agents, then, may tend to ''steer'' clients to homes paying higher commissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Williams, the Realtors association spokesman, maintained that the broker commission structure ''ensures greater access for first-time, low-income and many other home buyers who otherwise couldn't afford a home purchase.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That echoes an argument made by agents: that if buyers had to pay brokers directly, many would find it difficult to afford a home. Many buyers already struggle to save enough to cover a down payment and to secure a mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others, however, dismiss that concern. Stephen Brobeck, a senior fellow at the consumer federation, said buyers wouldn't have to come up with the cash upfront. Rather, they could finance the commission through their mortgage just as they finance other closing costs. And paying their agent directly would allow them the opportunity, perhaps, to negotiate a lower commission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plaintiffs, who are seeking class-action status for the suit, are asking for damages and a halt to the practice of having sellers' agents pay commissions to buyers' agents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The brokerages named in the suit are <span class="companylink">Realogy</span>, the parent of Century 21, Coldwell Banker and others; <span class="companylink">HomeServices of America</span>, a <span class="companylink">Berkshire Hathaway</span> affiliate; Re/Max; and Keller Williams. HomeServices and Keller Williams declined to comment. Re/Max said it would ''continue to vigorously defend'' itself against a ''baseless'' suit. <span class="companylink">Realogy</span> said in a statement that the case was ''without merit.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are some questions and answers about real estate commissions:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Can I negotiate the commission I pay a real estate agent?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors says all commissions are negotiable. But in practice, that may be difficult. In its research, the <span class="companylink">Consumer Federation of America</span> found that only about a quarter of agents interviewed said they would consider adjusting their commission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Brobeck at the consumer federation suggested that home buyers interview several agents and ask about commission splits. Some agents may be agreeable to different approaches, such as being paid by the hour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sellers do have other options. They can try to sell their home themselves, but it can be difficult to market a property without the help of an agent to list the home on multiple listing services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or they can work with some online brokerages that offer lower commissions. Redfin, for example, charges a 1.5 percent listing fee to sellers, and lowers the fee to 1 percent if the seller also buys a home on Redfin within a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What are commission rebates?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some brokers may offer commission ''rebates'' or refunds to home buyers. If, for example, a buyer's agent received a typical 2.5 percent commission, the agent may return part of that amount -- say 1 percent of the sale price -- to the buyer. Such rebates can save home buyers thousands of dollars, according to the Justice Department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But at least 10 states ban such rebates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What are current home mortgage rates?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates remain historically low. The average rate for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage was 2.87 percent for the week that ended Thursday, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>'s weekly survey.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of apartments sold in the last three months was down by 46 percent compared to the same period in 2019.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite hopes that New York’s real estate market would spring back to life over the summer after the coronavirus lockdown was lifted in June, the number of closed sales in Manhattan was down by 46 percent in the third quarter compared to the same period in 2019, according to new sales data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventory was up by 27 percent — the highest gain since 2009, according to a new report from the brokerage <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span> — and demand remains soft. The median sales price for apartments, $1.1 million, was 7 percent higher than at the same time last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The Manhattan market is crawling out of lockdown and has clearly been the outlier in the region in terms of coming back,” said Jonathan Miller, a New York appraiser and the author of the report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales at the lower end of the market, below $2 million, fell in the third quarter by 50.7 percent, compared to the same period last year. Despite a weak market, Mr. Miller reported an increase in bidding wars for properties priced under $2 million toward the end of the second quarter and the beginning of the third quarter, with 3.6 percent selling above the last asking price. UrbanDigs, a data reporting site, noted that 52 percent of contracts signed since Mar. 23 were for properties under $1 million, while 26.3 percent were in the $1 million to 2 million range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of higher-end properties, especially those in the resale market, remained flat between the second and third quarters, suggesting that sellers in the luxury sector aren’t as flexible about negotiating prices and don’t have the same sense of urgency about selling quickly. The number of condo and co-op sales in this sector dropped 47 percent this quarter compared to this time last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One category of the market that saw a relative boost was new development[https://www-nytimes-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/2020/09/11/realestate/new-development-brooklyn-queens-covid.html]. Sales of new apartments in Manhattan represented 15.6 percent of all sales this quarter, and median prices jumped by 18 percent, to $2,886,098, from $2,449,020 in the third quarter of last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But these prices aren’t reflective of the overall market, as prices of larger properties tend to skew the numbers on all new developments sold. For example, 16 units closed this quarter at 220 Central Park South, Robert A.M. Stern’s luxury condominium complex, including one for $99.9 million[https://www-nytimes-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/2020/07/28/realestate/duplex-sells-for-almost-100-million-at-220-central-park-south.html], and all of those sales went into contract before the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The month of September was the most active, by far, since the real estate market picked up again. Shaun Osher, the founder and chief executive of CORE Real Estate, said two factors led to this shift: the end of summer and the beginning of the school year. As people returned to the city, the number of in-person showings skyrocketed. “If I had to guess, the number of showings are up 10 times what it was in August,” Mr. Osher said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the increased interest hasn’t translated to sales yet. According to the Elliman report, the number of new signed contracts on co-ops in Manhattan was still down 33 percent in September, compared to this time last year, and condo sales were down by 51 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brooklyn is a different story, as the number of new signed contracts in September slightly exceeded[https://www-nytimes-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/2020/09/24/realestate/brooklyn-real-estate-sales.html] 2019 levels there. Still, “by no way, shape or form are we seeing the strength that previous markets have shown,” said Frederick Warburg Peters, the chief executive of Warburg Realty. “But the city is showing signs of recovery, and I’m cautiously optimistic that next spring will show robust numbers.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales in the suburbs are also plateauing, indicating that the outbound migration from the city may be waning. The number of new contracts signed for single-family homes and condos on Long Island, for example, was higher than 2019 levels, but the spike in sales seems to have topped out in mid-July and has been declining sharply since then.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Stefanos Chen </div><div>718 words</div><div>27 September 2020</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2020 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Six months into the pandemic, inventory is up in Manhattan while buyers are heading to Brooklyn for more space and lower prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Manhattan's real estate market continued to reel in August, Brooklyn had a near-record number of contract signings, spurred by bargain hunting New Yorkers and pent-up demand from months under quarantine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were 735 homes in Brooklyn that went into contract in August, a 38.7 percent increase from the same month last year, according to a new report from the real estate listings company StreetEasy. Contract signings were down 6 percent in Manhattan, and 4.3 percent in Queens in the same period. Pending sales data were not available for the Bronx and Staten Island.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The large jump in Brooklyn contract signings marks the first time that a borough has recorded year-over-year sales growth since February, before Covid-19 froze the market. The only time more contracts were signed in the borough was March 2019, when 748 deals were entered, said Nancy Wu, an economist for StreetEasy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It shows us that even in a pandemic, there are people interested in investing in the city long term,'' Ms. Wu said, and Brooklyn has been the most popular destination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A top priority for buyers was affordability -- at least relative to Manhattan's stubbornly high prices. Contract signings for the bottom fifth of listings in Brooklyn, where the median price was $253,000, doubled in August, to 134 deals from 67 in the same period last year, the biggest jump of any price tier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But demand was stronger or held steady across all price points, suggesting there were other factors driving sales. The top fifth of the Brooklyn market, with a median price of $1.6 million, had 147 signings, virtually unchanged from the same period a year ago. And the surge in sales was not only in affluent areas, like Downtown Brooklyn, but also in more affordable neighborhoods including Bay Ridge and Flatbush.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least some of the sales are attributable to pent-up demand, after the coronavirus essentially banned in-person apartment showings from mid-March through late June. But the disproportionate rebound in Brooklyn and, to a lesser extent, Queens, suggests that buyers are also adjusting priorities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Anything with outdoor space is flying, and renovated townhouses that are priced well are going into bidding wars,'' Melissa Leifer, an agent with Keller Williams NYC, said about the recovering Brooklyn market. About half of her buyers already live in the borough, while the other half are leaving homes in Manhattan, often with complaints of high maintenance costs, smaller apartments and a lack of green space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, a rebound is in its early days, after months of damage wrought by the virus. From January to the end of August, there were 3,467 contracts signed in Brooklyn, down from 4,813 in the same period last year, a roughly 30 percent drop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Growing interest in the boroughs beyond Manhattan could become part of the lasting legacy of the pandemic, said Ms. Wu, who predicts that the prevalence of work-from-home arrangements will change the calculus for buyers who once paid a premium for Midtown proximity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The shift is already underway. There were 10,639 units listed for sale in Manhattan last month, a 24 percent jump from the same period last year, and the highest total inventory in more than a decade, Ms. Wu said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While a glut of luxury inventory piles up, there remains a chronic shortage of affordable housing for sale in the five boroughs, and the demand is driving up prices. From March 1 to Sept. 22, 66 percent of homes in the Bronx, the most affordable borough, sold at or above asking price, the highest share in the city. Homes there had a median asking price of $430,500, according to StreetEasy.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Brookfield Properties</span>, the real estate company that operates more than 170 retail properties in the United States, plans to cut 20 percent of the employees in its retail division, according to a memo distributed to the staff on Monday, as the pandemic takes a toll on shopping centers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All our constituents -- retailers, lenders, communities, partners, investors, consumers, vendors, shareholders and our own employees -- have been affected by the events of this year and forced to revisit their relationships with our industry and our company,'' Jared Chupaila, the head of the company's retail group, said in the memo, which was obtained by The <span class="companylink">New York Times</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The unit has over 2,000 employees, according to a spokeswoman for Brookfield Properties. The layoffs will affect people who work at <span class="companylink">Brookfield Properties</span>' corporate headquarters and in malls. CNBC first reported on the cuts on Tuesday.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of Homes Soar,And So Do the Prices</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home sales surged to their highest level in nearly 14 years in August as the housing market continued to outperform the overall economy, but record high home prices could squeeze out first-time buyers amid a housing shortage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report from the National Association of Realtors confirmed home sales had recovered after slumping in an economic downturn as businesses were shuttered in March in an effort to slow the spread of Covid-19. Demand for housing is fueled by record-low mortgage rates and a pandemic-fueled migration to suburbs and low-density areas</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales increased 2.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of six million units last month, the highest level since December 2006. These sales, accounting for the bulk of U.S. home sales, jumped 10.5 percent on a year-on-year basis in August. Home sales rose in all four regions that month.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deutsche Plans to Close20% of Domestic Branches</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>, under intense pressure to cut costs, said Tuesday it would close one-fifth of its domestic branches after the pandemic helped persuade tech-averse Germans to switch to online banking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Germans are suspicious of electronic banking. Two-thirds of all consumer transactions are made with cash, according to a 2019 report by the consulting firm <span class="companylink">McKinsey &amp; Company</span>. But the coronavirus pandemic forced Germans to get friendly with banking online, emboldening <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> to close 100 out of 500 branches as part of a broader effort to cut costs and improve its chronically weak profits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The branch closures were first reported by Reuters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shuttering the branches will lead to an unspecified number of job losses, a Deutsche Bank spokesman said, but would not raise the overall total of 18,000 job cuts the bank had previously announced. JACK EWING

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unsurprisingly, the pandemic-era real estate market in this Dutchess County town has been ‘crazy,’ with some homes selling for over asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, as Covid-19 swept across New York, Jordan and Alina Ellington decided to leave the city for a while. After spending a couple of months in a Catskills <span class="companylink">Airbnb</span>, they resolved to make the move permanent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ellington, 50, is the owner of SecureReview[https://securereview.com/], a cybersecurity company; Ms. Ellington, 34, is a psychoanalyst completing her New York State licensing requirements. After years of apartment living in Manhattan, most recently in a rental on the 59th floor of a luxury high-rise, they began their search for a house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their criteria: “We wanted a country lifestyle, some land and some privacy, within an hour and a half of the city,” Mr. Ellington said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They made offers on two homes in northwestern New Jersey, but were outbid on the first (“We were heartbroken,” Mr. Ellington said) and withdrew their offer on the second (“We realized we just didn’t love the house,” he said). Then they discovered Pawling, in the southeast corner of Dutchess County, with its quaint village, forested vistas and Metro-North station. “Pawling fit our profile better than anyplace else,” Mr. Ellington said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On July 31, the couple closed on a 4,452-square-foot, three-bedroom colonial farmhouse, built in 1930 on 5.6 acres. They paid $525,000 for the property, which includes a heated pool and an apple orchard. They moved in the next day and, a few weeks later, adopted a Dutch shepherd named Velvet. “I’ve been waiting for the opportunity to have a large dog for some time,” Mr. Ellington said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The roughly 45-square-mile town of Pawling[https://www.pawling.org/] is bordered on the north by Dover, on the west by Beekman and a sliver of East Fishkill[https://www-nytimes-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/2020/02/26/realestate/east-fishkill-ny-close-to-the-city-but-far-enough-away.html], on the south by Putnam County and on the east by Sherman, Conn[https://www-nytimes-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/2018/11/28/realestate/sherman-conn-a-quiet-town-with-a-medley-of-people.html]. In its center sits the less-than-two-square-mile village of Pawling[https://www.villageofpawling.org/], a hub of shops, restaurants and small businesses. The town and village operate as separate municipalities but share some services. James Schmitt, the town supervisor, placed Pawling’s population at around 8,200, of which 6,500 live in the town and 1,700 in the village.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Either way, the Ellingtons’ property taxes may be higher than those for equivalent homes in surrounding towns. “Pawling likes keeping its commercial footprint small,” Mr. Schmitt said. “It’s no secret — that’s why taxes are high.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weekenders make up a significant portion of Pawling’s population — Gillian Stewart, a broker and owner of Gillian Stewart Real Estate, estimated about 30 percent — and they contribute to the town’s broad socioeconomic demographic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You have your commuters and your blue-collar residents,” Mr. Schmitt said. “And then you have your weekend-home people who fly in, in their helicopters.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What You’ll Find</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pawling, located about 70 miles north of Manhattan, is bisected north-south by Route 22. To the east is the Quaker Hill area, its leafy streets lined with horse farms and expansive estates. To the west are the hamlets of Holmes and Whaley Lake, whose centerpiece is a 252-acre lake. While the village bustles, the rest of the town feels quiet, with more than 400 acres of parkland and 1,100 acres of protected land, including part of the 20-mile-long Great Swamp[http://frogs-ny.org/about-the-great-swamp/].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pawling has all kinds of housing styles, from ranches and colonials to a cluster of Victorian homes in the village. Data from the Pawling assessor’s office indicates that the town has approximately 2,250 single-family houses and 45 multifamily houses. There are 150 condominiums in the Cedar Valley complex and 119 townhomes in Deerfield Ponds at Squire Green. The village has an additional 500 or so single-family homes, 70 multifamily homes and three four-story apartment buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What You’ll Pay</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Margaret Generoso, an agent with <span class="companylink">Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices</span>, said properties in Pawling run from the $200,000s for a condo or a smaller house that might need work into the millions for a multi-acre estate. “You can get a beautiful house for between $300,000 and $400,000,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Christina Shaw bought in that price range, she knew Pawling skewed pricier than its neighbors, but she wanted to live there. Last November, Ms. Shaw, 45, sold her home in Beekman for $300,000 and moved with her teenage son to Pawling, the location of her marketing and design company. She paid $361,000 for a 1,296-square-foot, three-bedroom ranch on 1.15 acres. “It was worth it to me to spend more money for a smaller house on a smaller lot,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the pandemic-era market, “it’s been crazy,” Ms. Stewart said. “Inventory is low, and demand is high. Some listings have multiple offers; some are going for over asking. That’s a new phenomenon for Pawling.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data provided by the Hudson Gateway Multiple Listing Service[http://www.hgar.com/mls/] indicated that as of Sept. 1, there were 60 single-family homes on the market. They ranged from a two-bedroom, 1,266-square-foot, two-story cottage built in 1940 on 0.11 acres, listed for $263,900, to a 291-acre historic estate with a five-bedroom, 4,704-square-foot house built in 1860, for $4.25 million. There were two multifamily homes for sale: a 2,318-square-foot, three-unit house on 0.6 acres, listed for $350,000, and a 4,034-square-foot, three-unit house on 6.88 acres, listed for $1.35 million. There were no available condominiums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sale price for a single-family home during the 12-month period ending Sept. 1 was $354,000, up from $306,500 during the previous year. For multifamily homes, the median was $360,000, up from $266,750. For condominiums, the median was $240,000, up from $235,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Vibe</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Shaw called Pawling “the quintessential small town, with lots of community activities” — among them, a townwide garage sale, an arts-and-crafts festival and a holiday Decemberfest, all sponsored by the Pawling Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Quaker Hill, the (temporarily closed) Akin Free Library, a Second Empire-style building, houses the Gunnison Museum of Natural History and the Historical Society Museum. At Lakeside Park, the town holds the Music by the Lake series every summer (it was canceled this year).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Music lovers can also enjoy the Pawling Concert Series, in its 46th season (but canceled through 2020), and rock shows (now live-streamed) at (the temporarily closed) Daryl’s House Restaurant and Live Music Club, owned by Daryl Hall, of Hall and Oates fame.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Appalachian Trail passes through town, and there are miles of trails in the 1,043-acre Pawling Nature Reserve[https://www-nature-org.proxy.library.brocku.ca/en-us/get-involved/how-to-help/places-we-protect/eastern-pawling-nature-reserve/], as well as the town-owned Edward R. Murrow Park and Lakeside Park, which has pickleball courts, a dog park and a sandy beach on Green Mountain Lake. The Pawling stretch of the Maybrook Trail[https://maybrooktrailway.org/] is expected to reopen later this year. And the first Pawling 24 Hour Trail Running Festival[https://ultrasignup.com/register.aspx?did=74349] is scheduled to take place this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part-timers and full-timers mingle in the village, Mr. Schmitt said: “Everyone ends up there ­— at the farmers’ market, at the restaurants — and everyone gets to know everyone.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Schools</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The town of Pawling is served by the Pawling Central School District[https://www.pawlingschools.org/], which also serves sections of Dover, Beekman and East Fishkill, in Dutchess County, and Patterson, in Putnam County. The district’s 1,074 students go to Pawling Elementary School for kindergarten through fourth grade, Pawling Middle School for fifth through eighth grade, and then Pawling High School. The middle and high schools share a campus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July, the district announced its reopening plans[https://www.pawlingschools.org/Reentry_plans_updates_and_Covid19]: a hybrid model with students in kindergarten through eighth grade attending daily and those in high school attending every other day. A fully remote option is also available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kim Fontana, the superintendent, confirmed that on the 2019 state assessments[https://data.nysed.gov/profile.php?instid=800000053365], 58 percent of the district’s fourth-graders were proficient in English language arts and 57 percent were proficient in math; statewide equivalents were 48 percent and 50 percent. Mean SAT scores for the district’s 2019 graduating class were 556 in evidence-based reading and writing, and 564 in math; statewide means were 531 and 533.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pawling is also home to Trinity-Pawling School, an all-boys private boarding and day school for seventh through 12th grade, and the private, coeducational Mizzentop Day School, for prekindergarten through eighth grade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commute</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commuters to Manhattan can catch Metro-North Railroad’s Harlem Line in the village at the Pawling station, where rush-hour trains to and from Grand Central Terminal take a little over two hours. Some commuters travel five miles south to the Patterson station, where overnight parking is available. In northern Pawling, the Appalachian Trail station offers a stop for hikers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of these options require a transfer in the town of Southeast. Round-trip fares are $46 peak, $35 off-peak and $475 monthly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Driving to or from the city, along Route 22 and Interstate 684, takes roughly 90 minutes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The History</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is now Pawling was the site of the first antislavery movement during the early days of the American Revolution. It was a Quaker movement, beginning with a declaration made in 1767, identifying the presence of God in every human being. “You couldn’t make God a slave,” Robert P. Reilly, Pawling’s historian, said. “It was wonderfully logical.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A large Quaker community had established itself in and around present-day Pawling after Nathan Birdsall, a surveyor and Quaker, settled there in 1728. After the Quakers’ declaration, they set about dismantling the slavery system, refusing to buy slaves and slave-made products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within a decade, slaves in the community were freed. “This was the first unified action against slavery in the colonies,” Mr. Reilly said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Oblong Friends Meeting House, where the community gathered, was built in 1764. The rustic wooden building still stands, owned by the Historical Society of Quaker Hill and Pawling[http://www.pawlinghistory.org/].</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the beginning of the pandemic, home sales in parts of the Sunshine State have more than doubled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the coronavirus shutdown began in March, Vanessa Antonelli and Jordan Epstein of Manalapan, N. J., rented a house in Orlando for a 10-day break with their 5-year-old daughter and 9-year-old son.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We quarantined and ended up staying three months,'' said Ms. Antonelli, 38, an interior designer. ''The pandemic made us re-evaluate the way we were living. It gave us the time to reflect.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June, despite being reluctant to move away from their close-knit New Jersey family, they bought a home in Boca Raton, in a new development that is planned like a country club without the golf.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And they are not alone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to a Douglas Elliman August report, new contracts for single-family homes and condominiums continued to rise in five south and central west coast Florida counties -- after having doubled in July. In Palm Beach County, new single-family and condo contracts remained significantly above levels from a year ago, with a 268 percent increase in single-family contracts over $1 million. In Miami-Dade, Pinellas, and Hillsborough counties, much of the annual gain was at higher price points. Brokers say that many of those moving to Florida are coming from northern cities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For those on the fence, ''the pandemic forced the issue, the recognition of advantages that weren't fully appreciated before,'' accelerating migration from high-taxed areas like New York, Chicago, Boston and California to the Sunshine State, said Jonathan Miller, president of Miller Samuel, the real estate appraisal and accounting firm that prepared the report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales at Boca Bridges, the development where Ms. Antonelli and Mr. Epstein bought a home, have been brisk. Since May 1, usually the off-season for Florida real estate, 102 houses there have sold for an average $1.7 million, said Jill DiDonna, senior vice president of sales and marketing at GL homes, the developer. When the community is completed, it will have 504 homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have seen unprecedented demand from all over the country, but certainly New York, New Jersey and Connecticut,'' Ms. DiDonna said, with buyers seeking home offices, larger kitchens for increased in-home dining, home gyms and private pools. ''The shifting product needs of the customer, along with the desire to escape urban areas, combined with the tax advantages, created the perfect storm.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Florida residents pay no state income or estate tax, and receive a homestead exemption of up to $50,000 on a primary residence and a 3 percent annual cap on home assessments, Ms. DiDonna said. The state's population has grown by about 343,000 in the last year, to about 22 million residents, according to worldpopulationreview.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Antonelli said she considered the lack of state income taxes in Florida ''a free gift with purchase.'' Even with an $800 homeowner's association fee to cover lawn and sprinkler service and the clubhouse, ''life wasn't going to be any more expensive for us in Florida,'' she said. She and her husband bought a five-bedroom, 5,900-square-foot ''Veneto'' model on a ''dream lot'' with a lake view for $1.4 million, adding 20 percent for a pool and other upgrades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Antonelli and her family have temporarily moved back to New Jersey, but plan to move to Florida next June when school lets out, and will rent a home there until their new house is ready in the spring of 2022. ''A lot of our final decisions will depend on how everything goes with this school year and Covid in New Jersey,'' Ms. Antonelli said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long a destination of choice for northerners weary of taxes and cold weather, Florida's appeal rose when the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 limited to $10,000 the amount of total state and local taxes that can be deducted on a federal income tax return.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite a spike in coronavirus cases in Florida earlier this summer, the pandemic has increased the state's allure. Demand at the wealthier end of the market has swelled ''across the major markets of South Florida -- Tampa and St. Pete are seeing the same amount of activity,'' said Jay Phillip Parker, chief executive of <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>'s Florida brokerage, with multimillion dollar sales snowballing in Palm Beach and Miami.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond Zoom calls and virtual tours, buyers fleeing urban centers have driven south or even chartered planes to view properties. Some who were wintering in Florida when the pandemic struck stayed. Many rented units ''were sold to the tenants,'' Mr. Parker said, noting that some statistics may be skewed because the activity was at a normally quiet time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The pandemic is one of the many elements that have contributed toward what we have always known to be a natural migration,'' Mr. Parker added. ''We've been referred to as the 'sixth borough'.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Boca Raton, about 50 miles north of Miami, inventory is low and ''demand is outrageous,'' said Jared Ringel, an agent at Compass Florida. ''There are multiple bids on houses now.'' Neighboring Delray Beach, along with Parkland and Coral Springs, where homes in gated communities sell for $600,000 to $700,000, are also popular among out-of-state buyers seeking good schools and restaurants, said Chris Franciosa, another Compass agent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the roughly 950 people moving to Florida every day, 45 percent head to South Florida, said Craig Studnicky, chief executive of ISG World, publisher of the 2020 Miami Report. During the pandemic, buyers are ''moving much more toward permanent living'' than to vacation homes. Many buyers from the Northeast were looking in August because they were concerned about whether ''Covid could come back during flu season. If they are going to quarantine, they want to be in nice weather.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family homes are ''the soup du jour,'' Mr. Studnicky said, accounting for 80 percent of residential transactions during the first six months of 2020. ''It is easier to social distance in a house.'' But interest in condos, currently a buyer's market, is inching up with the population swell, with one in three sales occurring near the coast between Coconut Grove and Fort Lauderdale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deena and Andrew Cromer moved to south Miami about a year ago. Though they loved living on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, their 850-square-foot, one bedroom co-op was cramped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our apartment felt like it was shrinking,'' said Ms. Cromer, 34, with their daughter's crib in a bedroom alcove and a son on the way. ''Having a two-bedroom wasn't going to solve our problem,'' she said. ''The taxes were eating up our paychecks.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last August, the Cromers sold their co-op for $900,000 and headed south. In December, for $1.1 million, they bought a five-bedroom, four-bath Mediterranean on a quarter-acre lot near Coral Gables. Mr. Cromer, a lawyer who grew up nearby, got a job at a local firm. Ms. Cromer switched gears from fashion to real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You get a lot more for your money here,'' Ms. Cromer said, including enough space for New York family to visit. ''I was very happy to be here in the warm weather during Covid. We are outside all the time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for Mr. Epstein and Ms. Antonelli, it turns out they didn't have to worry about leaving their New Jersey relatives after all. In July, Sue and Nick Antonelli, Ms. Antonelli's parents, paid $1.36 million to build a single-story contemporary next door at Boca Bridges. Alexis and Wes Hanas, Ms. Antonelli's sister and brother-in-law, picked a $1,115,900 five-bedroom house with a four-car garage at Lotus, a neighboring <span class="companylink">GL Homes</span> development, where houses average $970,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The entire clan plans to relocate when their new homes are completed. ''If the quarantine didn't happen, we would not have done this,'' Ms. Antonelli said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The coronavirus also significantly changed the life plans of Tufan Uzan. In March, when a co-worker in Mr. Uzan's software engineering group contracted Covid-19, Mr. Uzan, 35, began working remotely from his home in Medford, N.Y. After his pay was subsequently cut, he sold his three-bedroom house for $365,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July, based on a FaceTime tour with a leasing agent, Mr. Uzan rented an 800-square-foot one-bedroom for $3,050 a month at Society Las Olas, a new high-rise with a huge amenity deck in Fort Lauderdale. This fall, he plans to look for a new job, and he also plans to buy a house in Boca Raton, Del Ray or Parkland by the time his 12-month lease expires.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everything is more attractive here,'' Mr. Uzan said. ''I was going to move here when I retired. Covid moved it up 20 years.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zack Stertz and Zoe Salzman had lived in Brooklyn for 15 years. But the coronavirus made them rethink staying in their two-bedroom apartment, which they felt was too small for working from home with two young sons, especially if schools did not open for in-person classes in the fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So they moved to Maplewood, N.J., this summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“To give up living in Brooklyn and move to suburbs, we just couldn’t see ourselves there,” said Ms. Salzman, 39, a lawyer whose office is in Manhattan. “But the pandemic helped make this choice for us.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Home sales are soaring in the suburbs and plummeting in New York City.[https://www-nytimes-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/2020/08/30/nyregion/nyc-suburbs-housing-demand.html]]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for homes in New York City’s suburbs, including New Jersey, Westchester County, Connecticut and Long Island, has been surging as many companies continue to embrace remote work. Many buyers express worries about the health risks of living in packed urban neighborhoods, and want space and land that New York City often cannot provide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What does the boom look like?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A three-bedroom house in East Orange, N.J., had 97 showings, received 24 offers and went under contract for 21 percent over the $285,000 price it was listed for. Six people made offers on a $499,000 house in Valley Stream on Long Island even though they had not seen it in person (the house had been shown on a <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> Live video).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July, there was a 44 percent increase in home sales for the suburban counties surrounding the city when compared with numbers in 2019, according to Miller Samuel Real Estate Appraisers &amp; Consultants[https://www.millersamuel.com/]. The increase was 112 percent in Westchester and 73 percent in Fairfield County, Conn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What about the number of properties sold in Manhattan? That dropped by 56 percent when compared with last year, according to Miller Samuel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Has this happened before?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not in recent memory, according to officials, real estate agents and residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts say that the trend feels like the one that drove decades of suburbanization after World War II.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, people have left the city for the suburbs for decades in search of high-performing public schools.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A vaccine or treatment for the coronavirus could change the calculus, especially if city workplaces reopen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What are the consequences?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People who leave will no longer pay personal income tax to the city, dealing a potential blow to the city’s budget, said Maria Doulis, vice president of strategy and operations at the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonpartisan fiscal watchdog.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That could hinder the city’s ability to maintain police and sanitation services, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mayor Bill de Blasio said this week that he had no doubt that New Yorkers who left during the pandemic would eventually return.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If you don’t think New York City is coming back,” Mr. de Blasio said, “then you don’t know New York City.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And finally: The U.S. Open</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Matthew Futterman writes:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was late March, and the leaders of tennis in the United States already knew that this year’s U.S. Open would be unlike anything they had ever experienced, if they could stage it at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With much of the world, and especially New York City, reeling from the coronavirus pandemic, they had no idea where or when the Open might take place, or if anyone would bother to show up for an event held in the city for more than 100 years, one of its biggest and most economically important festivals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So Mike Dowse, the newly installed chief executive of the United States Tennis Association, set up a team to determine how to carry out the event, setting in motion a grand experiment that could show what international sports, as well as New York, might be capable of while navigating the public health threat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[Will the U.S. Open show that big events can return to New York?[https://www-nytimes-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/2020/08/30/sports/tennis/coronavirus-us-open-bubble.html]]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Players, who began arriving in mid-August for a smaller tournament held before the U.S. Open begins today, are mostly cloistered in a Long Island hotel, preparing to play in cavernous stadiums without spectators at the U.S.T.A. Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows, Queens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And at the tennis center, where some 50,000 people usually pack the stadiums each day, there are few hints of the usual food, merchandising and corporate entertainment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Bernard Camins, an infectious-diseases specialist at Mount Sinai Health Systems who advised the U.S.T.A. on its protocols, said that having athletes arrive from all over the world made staging the tournament especially complicated. Officials quickly determined that if they required a two-week quarantine period ahead of the tournament, no one would come. They decided instead to administer two tests within the first 48 hours and follow up on testing every four days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“A living experiment, that is exactly how our eyes are viewing this,” said Dr. Andrew Wallach, chief medical officer for ambulatory care for the New York City Health and Hospitals Corp. “What we are going to learn from the tournaments is a little different than a football game, but we are going to learn about preparedness and testing protocols and tracing in a sporting event.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pandemic is spurring home sales as prosperous city residents seek more space. One listing had 97 showings and received 24 offers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over three days in late July, a three-bedroom house in East Orange, N.J., was listed for sale for $285,000, had 97 showings, received 24 offers and went under contract for 21 percent over that price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Long Island, six people made offers on a $499,000 house in Valley Stream without seeing it in person after it was shown on a <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> Live video. In the Hudson Valley, a nearly three-acre property with a pool listed for $985,000 received four all-cash bids within a day of having 14 showings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the pandemic began, the suburbs around New York City, from New Jersey to Westchester County to Connecticut to Long Island, have been experiencing enormous demand for homes of all prices, a surge that is unlike any in recent memory, according to officials, real estate agents and residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July, there was a 44 percent increase in home sales for the suburban counties surrounding the city when compared with the previous year, according to Miller Samuel Real Estate Appraisers &amp; Consultants[https://www.millersamuel.com/]. The increase was 112 percent in Westchester, just north of New York City, and 73 percent in Fairfield County, Conn., just over the state border.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, the number of properties sold in Manhattan plummeted 56 percent, according to Miller Samuel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The suburban demand, driven in part by New York City residents who are able to work remotely while offices are closed, raises unsettling questions about how fast the city will be able to recover from the pandemic. It is an exodus that analysts say is reminiscent of the one that fueled the suburbanization of America in the second half of the 20th century.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not just crowded open houses, multiple offers and bids above asking prices. People in New Jersey suburbs who have no interest in putting their homes on the market are receiving unsolicited calls and knocks on the door from brokers asking if they want to sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, residents have left New York City for the suburbs for decades, especially to bring up children in towns with strong public schools. And it is very difficult to predict whether the new migration will continue at this pace once a vaccine for the coronavirus is available and office towers in the city fully reopen. What’s more, most New York City residents do not have the means to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on a home in the suburbs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts have predicted New York City’s demise during past crises, including the Sept. 11 terror attacks, only to be proven wrong. In fact, even as office towers in Manhattan remain largely empty because of the outbreak, some businesses, including Amazon and Facebook[https://www-nytimes-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/2020/08/18/technology/amazon-office-expansion.html], are expanding their footprints, betting that workers will eventually return to their desks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, many companies and workers have become much more comfortable with remote work during the outbreak, suggesting that the suburbs will remain very attractive for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, many buyers in the suburbs are expressing concern about the health risks of living in densely packed urban neighborhoods. Facing pandemic restrictions, they want room that New York City often cannot provide: a yard for their children to play and an office to work remotely. Many want land, even if it means being farther away from Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some buyers have told brokers they are concerned about reports of rising crime in New York City, real estate agents said. (Overall crime has not spiked in the city, but shootings have, Police Department data shows.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The people from New York are coming with a sense of urgency, and the thing they want is space,” said James Hughes, a real estate agent in New Jersey[https://www.jameshughesteam.com/], who added that roughly 60 percent of potential buyers for his properties live in the city. “The demand is insane.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zack Stertz and Zoe Salzman joined the buying frenzy in June. After 15 years in Brooklyn, they said they realized soon after the pandemic struck that their two-bedroom apartment with a backyard, generous by New York standards, was too small for working from home with two young sons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They could not afford a renovated brownstone in Brooklyn and were worried that New York City schools would not open for in-person classes in the fall, so they looked at New Jersey. They weren’t the only ones, their broker at the Allison Ziefert Real Estate Group[https://azhomesnj.com/] warned them, suggesting they act fast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When a four-bedroom house in Maplewood, N.J., appeared on the market on June 12, they toured it on June 14 and two days later submitted an offer over the $799,000 listing price — the highest bid among many offers. The sellers accepted it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“To give up living in Brooklyn and move to suburbs, we just couldn’t see ourselves there,” said Ms. Salzman, 39, a lawyer whose office is in Manhattan. “But the pandemic helped make this choice for us.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The flight out of New York City could inhibit the city’s economic recovery and its ability to maintain quality-of-life services like the police and sanitation, said Maria Doulis, vice president of strategy and operations at the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonpartisan fiscal watchdog.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What is worrisome is that the high-income earners, particularly those with more than $1 million, provide a substantial amount of resources to the New York City budget,” Ms. Doulis said. “To lose them would really represent a blow to the budget.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mayor Bill de Blasio said this week that he had no doubt that New Yorkers who left during the pandemic would eventually return, though he appeared to be referring more to people who had temporarily moved elsewhere, including to second homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If you don’t think New York City is coming back,” Mr. de Blasio said, “then you don’t know New York City.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, real estate agents across the region say they have been swamped with calls from New Yorkers who are rethinking their desire to stay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moving companies have said they cannot keep up with the demand[https://www-nytimes-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/2020/08/20/nyregion/moving-new-york-coronavirus.html?referringSource=articleShare]. Metropolis Moving in Brooklyn said the number of quotes for out-of-state moves jumped by more than 200 percent in May and in June compared with those months last year, and by more than 165 percent in July versus a year ago. Most people seeking quotes were moving to the city’s suburbs, he said, though others were moving to areas stretching from Washington, D.C., to Boston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across New Jersey, more than 29,700 homes were sold in June and July, an increase of 33 percent over the same period in 2019, according to the Otteau Group[https://www.otteau.com/], a real estate data and appraisal firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeffrey G. Otteau, who is the president of the company, said the buying spree was particularly notable because it was happening when fewer homes were on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the start of the year through July, the inventory in New Jersey dropped 40 percent compared with same period last year — a sign that many homeowners in the state were staying put during an uncertain economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The demand has to come from somewhere, and we think most of that is coming from New York City,” Mr. Otteau said. “In some ways, this looks to me like the 1960s and 1970s, when there was a large outflow of the population pushing into the suburbs.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hughes, the New Jersey real estate agent, said he had multiple clients who each lost bids on about half-dozen homes, including a two-bedroom house in East Orange that received 25 offers. It sold for $345,000 — 21 percent over the asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s crazy for any period,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For more than two months, Rennes Toussaint and her fiancé, Olajide Keshinro, have been looking at houses in New Jersey. The couple, who live in a 500-square-foot apartment in Queens, have submitted offers for four homes, but lost out on all of them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the outbreak, the couple discussed leaving the city for the suburbs, but never this soon. It became urgent when Mr. Keshinro, who plays professional basketball overseas, suddenly returned home early, Ms. Toussaint said, and the apartment felt even smaller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We thought it would be easy, but it’s very, very, very competitive,” Ms. Toussaint, 33, said about the housing search.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York’s Hudson Valley, the number of homes sold in July in Putnam County jumped 35 percent from the year before; they climbed 19 percent in Dutchess County.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Melissa Carlton, a broker at Houlihan Lawrence, said the area’s picturesque towns and scenic views had long attracted second-home buyers and people who want weekend getaways. But New York City residents have recently explored the area for permanent residences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Last year, people would say that a property may be too far away from the train station,” Ms. Carlton said. “That is not the case this year.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is how Rehana Alam and Sadi Alam feel. They live with their three children — ages 9, 7 and 4 — in a home they own in Jamaica, Queens. It is a 15-minute commute for Sadi Alam, a podiatrist, to get to work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Alams have been concerned that their children have been largely confined to their home during the pandemic. Over the summer, the couple decided to get more indoor and outdoor space for their children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, they closed on a five-bedroom house with a pool on two acres in Dix Hills, Long Island, about 30 miles east of Queens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The best thing I could have done was provided them more space,” Ms. Alam, 35, said. “Looking at their sad faces, it just wasn’t worth staying in Queens.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home building in the United States accelerated by the most in nearly four years in July, in the latest sign that the housing sector is emerging as one of the few areas of strength in an economy suffering a record slowdown because of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts increased 22.6 percent -- the biggest gain since October 2016 -- to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.496 million units last month, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data for June was revised up to a 1.22 million-unit pace from the previously reported 1.186 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists polled by Reuters had forecast that housing starts would increase to a rate of 1.24 million units. July's data exceeded even the highest estimate of 1.32 million units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">July's construction pace was the fastest since February, the month when a record-long U.S. economic expansion abruptly ended as the coronavirus began spreading rapidly across the country, prompting business shutdowns and widespread stay-at-home orders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With last month's increase, new home building is just 4.5 percent below February's pace of 1.567 million units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wall Street, the benchmark S&amp;P 500 Index .SPX regained a record high in Tuesday morning trading, completing a full recovery from the stock market crash after the onset of the coronavirus crisis in February. Shares of several leading U.S. home builders were also at a record, including <span class="companylink">DR Horton Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Lennar Corporation</span>. Shares of both are up around 40 percent this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The largest increases in home building were in the Northeast, up 35 percent from June, and the South, up 33 percent from the prior month. Construction starts were up by around 6 percent in the Midwest and West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Multifamily projects of five units or more surged by nearly 57 percent -- also the largest increase since October 2016 -- while single-family construction rose by just 8.2 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, the National <span class="companylink">Association of Home Builders</span> reported confidence among housing construction firms surged this month to match a record high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, the National Association of Realtors is expected to report sales of previously owned homes accelerated for a second month, to the fastest rate since February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Strong demand and a record level of home builder confidence will support housing starts in the second half of 2020, but the still-widespread coronavirus and an economy struggling to recover without fiscal support may limit the upside,'' Oxford Economics economists wrote in a note after the release of the housing starts report.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suburbs and fashionable exurbs are hot, but don't forget that home prices have fallen before, a Nobel laureate warns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are signs that pockets of the U.S. housing market are heating up, particularly in the suburbs and fashionable exurbs, to which people have been fleeing to escape the coronavirus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some first-time buyers are feeling a sudden hurry to buy, fearing higher prices if they wait. But they are also worried about the long-run outlook for home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the United States, according to the S&amp;P/<span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>/Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, adjusted for inflation, real home prices rose 45 percent from February 2012 through May 2020, the latest data. (I helped to create the index but have no financial interest in it.) Other sources indicate that prices remain high. That is a remarkable record, considering that the United States is grappling with the coronavirus pandemic, a major recession and social upheaval. In that stretch, there were no down years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would be easy to assume that the boom times for housing will go on forever, but that would require ignoring the disaster that led to the most recent great financial crisis, a little more than a decade ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recall some recent history. Real home prices rose 75 percent from February 1997 to a peak in December 2005, apparently unaffected by the 2001 U.S. recession and the steep stock market decline of 2000 to 2002. Delusions of eternal price increases for houses -- thought to be much more reliable than stocks -- sprouted in that era, not so long ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But housing prices crashed 36 percent from their 2005 high, to a low in February 2012, and the impact of that decline spread into other financial markets and crippled the global economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a home buyer in 2005, who put up life savings for a 10 percent or 20 percent down payment, the price decline amounted to a devastating loss by 2012. If they had been able to hold on until now, their real home value would probably be mostly restored, but no one would want that 15-year experience again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'm not making a prediction. This is not 2005, and many things have changed. The work-at-home trend today, aided by online communications, is notably different. If one does not have to commute to work in a city, there is so much land out there in America that many new suburban houses can be built, supply can increase to meet the demand, and home prices in the suburbs may never rise as much as they did in the previous boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But still, looking at the market cycle has to be instructive. In an impressive new book, ''The Great American Housing Bubble,'' Adam Levitin of <span class="companylink">Georgetown University</span> and Susan Wachter of the <span class="companylink">Wharton School</span> summarized six possible causes of that epic boom-and-bust cycle. Succinctly put, they are:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers' ''irrational exuberance,'' referring to an analysis that I made in the second edition of a book with that title in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ''fair lending and affordable housing policy'' starting with the 1977 Community Reinvestment Act, which made it easier for poorer people to buy houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> cuts in interest rates, which may have set off price speculation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A global savings glut -- excessive saving worldwide, given available investment opportunities, a theory proposed by Ben S. Bernanke, the former Fed chairman, in explanation of low interest rates in the early 2000s.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A shift in mortgage lending to ''unregulated private-label securitization by private investment banks,'' a theory developed by the two authors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All these factors, as well as <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> decisions affecting mortgage rates, are part of the story of the 1997 to 2012 boom and crash. So are the difficulties faced by the Fed and other regulators, as described in a new and imposing 595-page volume, ''First Responders,'' edited by Mr. Bernanke and two former U.S. treasury secretaries, Timothy Geithner and Henry Paulson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of the theories point to a fragile boom-time mind-set that underestimated home price risk, whether by home buyers, investors, mortgage originators, securitizers, rating agencies or regulators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So let us dig a little deeper. What caused all these errors back then?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultimately, it came down to unwarranted optimism and excitement about home prices. There were, during the 1997-2005 boom, constellations of narratives about housing that grew contagious over time, even transcending national borders. Intense ''real estate voyeurism'' -- envious online snooping of other peoples' home values -- became common. The exuberant mind-set displaced thoughts of price declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stories abounded of ''flippers,'' people who made fantastic profits buying, fixing up, and selling homes within a matter of months. The so-called experts in those days hardly ever mentioned that the high rate of increase in home prices might one day be reversed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In retrospect, it appears that there was a political component to the housing craze. President George W. Bush said the United States was becoming an ''ownership society'' in his successful 2004 re-election campaign. He promoted the idea of homeownership in a way that flattered the apparent wisdom of people who bought houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newspaper articles shortly after Mr. Bush won became much more comfortable with the idea that something akin to an ''ownership society'' was the country's future, part of a longer trend that defined the ''American dream'' as owning a home. In that atmosphere, people rarely even considered the possibility that home prices could ever fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starting just before the 2005 peak, however, the news media started discussing a new idea, the existence of a ''housing bubble'' for single-family homes, whose prices had become obviously high. Before that, there just wasn't much talk about the idea that a bubble could be forming in the market for single-family homes. That sudden change is worth remembering. It is a model for what might happen again one day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's not where the United States is now. The prevailing narratives are different and the underlying economic situation is dominated by the coronavirus pandemic. Furthermore, there tends to be a lot of momentum in home prices. The boom that started in 2012 could conceivably go on for years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there is a chance that inadequate public support for homeowners in these difficult times will result in a rash of foreclosures, personal bankruptcies and houses dumped on the market. From the intensity of public reactions to current social and economic problems, it seems possible that the United States is nearing a turning point in the thinking of many people, and this could affect the housing market and the economy. If President Trump and his ''Make America Great Again'' narrative continue to polarize the country as the election grows near, confidence in the solidity of housing prices could drop sharply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This poses a dilemma for prospective home buyers, who must make life-changing decisions with imperfect knowledge of the future. History suggests that it might be wise to avoid investing in too expensive of a house or in taking on too much risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the value of a good place to live for a family cannot be quantified. If you can afford the cost, a house that you will live in for years to come may be worthwhile, regardless of the short-term shifts in the market.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The overall economy may be looking shaky, but one exception is the housing market. The National Association of Realtors’ Pending Home Sales Index jumped 16.6 percent in June, hitting its highest level since 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>’s decision to cut interest rates to near zero has provided support, with many home buyers taking advantage of exceptionally low borrowing costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts have also bounced back, rising 17 percent last month, according to the Commerce Department. Sales of new homes rose 13.8 percent in June and 19.4 percent in May. Demand for new homes should help revive construction jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Home sales continue to see a bounce reflecting low mortgage rates as well as stronger demand as more and more people work from home and opt for larger spaces,” said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at the research firm High Frequency Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, Ms. Farooqi said, a desire to move from densely populated urban areas to the suburbs and beyond is driving sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I don’t know how long this lasts, but I wouldn’t be surprised if there’s momentum for the next month or two,” Ms. Farooqi said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Record-low interest rates and a shortage of listings have produced a fast-paced seller’s market, but many areas are still lagging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Coronavirus restrictions brought the U.S. housing market to a near standstill. Now it’s beginning to recover, if unevenly, as states enact their reopening plans, according to a report by Realtor.com[https://www.realtor.com/research/housing-market-recovery-index-trends-july-11-data/].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report compiles a “recovery index,” combining several market metrics and comparing the results through July 11 with January 2020 levels. These include growth in online search activity and new listings, as well as asking prices and time on market. While the index doesn’t measure the number of completed sales, promising gains in inquiries and prices are spurring optimism and raising values in several major markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall, the recovery index showed these metrics to be approaching pre-pandemic levels, though the gains are not equal across the country. States in the West and Northeast are showing the greatest growth, while those the South and Midwest — now suffering a heavy wave of Covid-19 infections, along with the restrictions and economic uncertainty that come with them — are lagging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In total, 18 of the 50 largest U.S. markets have reached or even surpassed January levels of market activity. A seller’s market, brought about by a shortage of listings, record-low interest rates[https://www-nytimes-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/2020/07/16/business/mortgage-rates-below-3-percent.html] and a release of pent-up demand after the shutdowns, is fueling the recovery. Eager house hunters, equipped with increased buying power driven by the low interest rates, are producing quick sales and higher prices — which means hopeful buyers are facing lots of competition.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of Existing Homes Jump 21% After a Slump</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans stepped up their home purchases in June by a robust 20.7 percent after the pandemic had caused sales to crater in the prior three months. But the housing market could struggle to rebound further in the face of the resurgent viral outbreak and a shrinking supply of homes for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes rose last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.72 million, the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday. Despite the sharp gain, purchases are still down 11.3 percent from a year ago, when homes had sold at an annual pace of 5.32 million. And Lawrence Yun, the Realtors' chief economist, noted that sales remain roughly 20 percent below their pre-pandemic levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, housing has managed to avoid a deeper slump from the severe recession caused by the coronavirus. Demand has remained strong among buyers who have weathered the downturn, while record-low mortgage rates have helped. A.P.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Sydney Franklin </div><div>662 words</div><div>9 July 2020</div><div>00:01</div><div>NYTimes.com Feed</div><div>NYTFEED</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2020. The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales volume declined across New York’s northern suburbs in the second quarter, although there was an uptick in activity in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The coronavirus severely hampered the spring sales market for homes in Westchester County, with the number of sales dropping by more than 27 percent in the last three months compared to the same period last year, the largest decline recorded in 11 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales in Westchester fell off significantly in April and May, but picked up once brokers were allowed to start showing homes in person again in June. Sales volume also declined farther north in Dutchess and Putnam Counties, according to quarterly reports released by <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of contracts signed in Westchester jumped from 801 in May to 1,215 in June, an increase of 53 percent. The flurry of post-lockdown activity in June is a good sign, but the total is still 15 percent below the number for the same time last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“What we saw this quarter was atypical,” said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of Miller Samuel Real Estate Appraisers &amp; Consultants and the author of the report. “The surge suggests this outbound migration from the city is happening, but really this is a result of the market turning back on.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers started seeing increased interest from city dwellers[https://www-nytimes-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/2020/05/08/realestate/coronavirus-escape-city-to-suburbs.html] looking for more space to escape the pandemic in April and May. “We don’t know for sure, but part of the contract activity in this rebound is coming from new demand as people are looking at the suburbs as an alternative,” Mr. Miller said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two of the biggest factors for New Yorkers looking to move north are the amount of acreage available in a listing and whether or not it includes a pool, said Scott Durkin, president of <span class="companylink">Douglas Elliman</span>, noting that outdoor space and pools ranked as top search terms for Westchester and Hudson Valley properties on the Elliman website.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“People are wondering if there’s a large exodus from the city and I don’t think there is,” Mr. Durkin said. “The silver lining of all this is that people realized they needed a weekend home, a second home, or a second-primary home.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of its size, proximity to Manhattan and the new inventory that hit the market in June, Westchester saw a slight increase in the median sales price of its listings with an 8 percent uptick over last year. The median price for single-family homes rose from $700,000 to $710,000, despite a steep drop in sales volume.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices for single-family homes in Putnam County dipped slightly from last year as well, but Dutchess County saw a healthy increase, rising 6.6 percent from the second quarter of 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I think further reaches from the city are ultimately going to benefit disproportionately,” said Mr. Miller, noting the strength of Putnam and Dutchess Counties over Westchester. “In Putnam, you had prices slip and a modest decline in sales activity, but we don’t really know how it will turn out. It’s not some defining moment for Putnam just yet.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The coronavirus lockdown may have stalled much of the spring market, but Mr. Durkin noted that the pre-pandemic market was on track to break records, with Elliman’s sales in the region up almost 30 percent over the previous year thanks to the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>’s decision to lower interest rates on mortgages[https://www-nytimes-com.proxy.library.brocku.ca/2020/04/02/realestate/how-do-lower-mortgage-rates-affect-your-buying-power.html].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pent-up demand caused by the pandemic lockdown likely spurred the increased activity in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It will be interesting to see how the demand and supply get satiated in the coming months,” Mr. Miller said. “The question is whether we’ll continue the narrative of the boom in activity or whether we’ve just moved the seasons around a little bit.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The month's biggest closing was an apartment on the 88th floor of One57 that was acquired for 41 percent below the original purchase price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of closings slowed in New York City during the month of June as the coronavirus took a toll on buying activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most expensive recorded transaction was a full-floor aerie near the apex of One57, once the city's priciest condominium. The apartment sold in a private deal linked to a Chinese conglomerate for $28 million, a 41 percent discount from the original purchase price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A deep reduction also took place at Time Warner Center's Residences at the Mandarin Oriental, where a penthouse sold for $23 million, 25 percent below its purchase price nine years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the volume of sales contracts has been plummeting, the market is expected to rebound now that restrictions on real estate activity, instituted to curb the spread of the virus, have been eased. ''It will feel like a boom initially,'' said Jonathan J. Miller, a Manhattan real estate appraiser. ''But it's really a release of pent-up demand. We're going to have a busy summer.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already brokers see some movement. ''Since the reopening, I've seen an uptick in activity with requests for showings as well as apartments coming on the market,'' said Chris Kann, an agent with <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>. ''People want to move on with their lives.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The month of June also saw several townhouse closings, which Mr. Kann and other real estate professionals attributed in part to demand for outdoor space. The most expensive, at $14.2 million, was a five-story, 25-foot-wide house at 125 East 92nd Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the other townhouse sales: the longtime Upper East Side home of Christopher B. Cerf, an author, composer and lyricist who wrote numerous songs for ''Sesame Street''; and the West Village home of Harry A. Lawton III, the former president of Macy's, and his wife, Joanne Lawton.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment at One57 is on the 88th floor of the 90-story tower at 157 West 57th Street, on billionaires' row in Midtown. It sits just below a duplex that sold for almost $100.5 million in 2015, reportedly to Michael Dell, the chief executive of Dell Technologies, and once held the record for the highest price paid for a single city residence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unit No. 88 was purchased brand-new, also in 2015, for nearly $47.4 million by Pac Wholly Own, an entity associated with the Pacific American Corporation, a New York subsidiary of the <span class="companylink">HNA Group</span> of China. (Guoqing Chen, a founder of HNA's <span class="companylink">Hainan Airlines</span>, still owns a residence on the 86th floor.) Its buyer was the limited liability company OFS Property, whose managing partner is an executive at HNA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 6,231-square-foot apartment features four bedrooms, four bathrooms and a powder room, along with floor-to-ceiling windows that provide panoramic park, water and cityscape vistas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The month's runner-up sale -- a penthouse on the 76th floor of the 80-story Mandarin Oriental, at 80 Columbus Circle -- has four bedrooms and five and a half baths, and comes with a separate storage room. There's also an 8-by-64-foot terrace off the living room and a master suite that looks out onto Central Park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seller, whose identity was shielded by the limited liability company 80 Columbus Circle (NYC), had paid $30.6 million for the apartment in 2011. The new owner was listed as Dempcat LLC.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mandarin Oriental, which opened in 2003, is situated in the north tower of Time Warner Center. It has 64 condo units directly above the hotel, starting on the 64th floor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cerf's townhouse, at 146 East 62nd Street, between Lexington and Third Avenues, was sold for $7.8 million to the <span class="companylink">Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</span>, whose headquarters abuts the property. (The foundation plans to expand its office space there, according to Michele Warman, the chief operating officer.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house, built in the early 1900s, stands five stories high and 20 feet wide with about 5,432 square feet of interior space and a rear garden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cerf, who won three Grammy Awards and one Emmy for children's music and programing, had paid $248,000 for the building in 1968, a year before ''Sesame Street'' first aired.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He leaves behind myriad memories. It was at this house where he worked on projects for the likes of National Lampoon magazine and <span class="companylink">Random House</span>, the publishing company that his father, Bennett Cerf, co-founded. In 2015, he was married there to the writer Katherine Vaz.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Lawtons sold their townhouse, at 33 Charles Street, for nearly $9.8 million, about 7 percent off the $10.5 million they had paid for it less than three years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The renovated four-story structure extends about 3,737 square feet, with three bedrooms and two and a half baths. There is also ample exterior space, including a terrace off the media room that overlooks a landscaped rear garden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house was once home to the actors Hilary Swank and Chad Lowe; they acquired it through a trust in 2002 and sold it almost three and a half years later. The new owner, under contract since late May, is the limited liability company Kousa Realty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lawton, who served as president of Macy's from 2017 to 2019, is now the chief executive of the Tractor Supply Company, which is based in Brentwood, Tenn.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For 3rd Straight Month</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales in the United States dropped 9.7 percent in May, the third straight monthly decline and further evidence of the harm the pandemic has done to the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said Monday that the monthly decline pushed sales down to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.91 million, the slowest pace since a home buyers tax credit expired in October 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales fell in all regions of the country, with the biggest decline coming in the Northeast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of both existing and new homes have fallen sharply during the traditional spring selling season while communities were locked down. Sales in the Northeast slumped 13.9 percent from the previous month while sales in the West fell 11.1 percent. Sales slid 10 percent in the Midwest and 8 percent in the South.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The German payment service provider Wirecard said Monday it has concluded that 1.9 billion euros, or $2.1 billion, supposedly held in two escrow accounts, probably doesn't exist, deepening troubles that last week prompted the resignation of its chief executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Wirecard AG</span> was once regarded as a star of the growing financial technology sector, but its shares fell sharply after the company became the subject of multiple <span class="companylink">Financial Times</span> reports about accounting irregularities in its Asian operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, the company disclosed that auditors couldn't find accounts containing the 1.9 billion euros and postponed its annual report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two Philippine banks that were said to hold the money in escrow accounts said that they had no dealings with Wirecard and the country's central bank governor said none of the missing money entered the Philippines' financial system. A.P.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real estate market is challenging this spring -- all the more so because lenders are checking, and rechecking, borrowers' finances in response to the economic turmoil of the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates may be appealingly low, but people shopping for a new home this spring face a challenging market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand, which was pent up during coronavirus stay-at-home orders, and a dearth of homes for sale are keeping prices high and setting off bidding wars in some areas as states continue to reopen for business. Some buyers may also find it tougher to qualify for mortgages, as lenders require higher credit scores and bigger down payments in response to higher unemployment and economic uncertainty in the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The situation is different from the economic downturn in 2008, when home prices fell sharply as a housing bubble popped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're still seeing a huge sellers' market,'' said Colsie Searcy, an agent in Colorado Springs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, the median price for a home, excluding new construction, was about $287,000 in April, up more than 7 percent from a year earlier, the National Association of Realtors reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing supply was already tight in recent years, especially for first-time buyers, because of the sluggish pace of new construction, said Danielle Hale, chief economist for the listing site Realtor.com. Then uncertainty because of the pandemic gave buyers cold feet, leading some sellers to pull their homes from the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales in April were down about 18 percent from a year earlier. Declines were particularly steep in the West. But Realtor.com reported this week that there were signs of improvement in May, ''setting the stage'' for continued recovery over the summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, with many states lifting restrictions on home tours, the housing market is reawakening. Shoppers are feeling more comfortable visiting properties: About two-thirds of people who attended an open house within the past year said they would attend an open house now ''without hesitation,'' a separate survey from the Realtors association found.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some sellers remain cautious. They want to show homes by appointment only, and they want offers from serious buyers who have been preapproved for financing, said Lawrence Yun, chief economist with the association. ''They don't want casual shoppers,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jay Rinehart Jr., a broker in Rock Hill, S.C., said he did a lot of ''coaching'' to prepare buyers for the market. (He sells homes in South Carolina as well as in North Carolina, near Charlotte.) He recalled that early last week, seven homes were available in a client's price range. By the end of the week, there were just three.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the market tilts in favor of sellers, Mr. Rinehart advises buyers to ignore certain issues, like minor repairs, that they may have negotiated over in a less heated market. ''This is an unusual time,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Diana Ragland said she and her husband had started looking for a larger home for their family in Colorado Springs in February, but put their search on hold when in-person home tours were suspended because of the pandemic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We weren't willing to make an offer when we could only do virtual tours,'' she said. ''I have to physically walk through and get the smell of the house.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May, with the restrictions lifted, the couple were able to tour a new house that met their needs, and their offer was accepted within a few days. Their old house went under contract in just two days, and both properties are expected to close on the same day this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While most shoppers balk at buying properties without visiting them first, that has sometimes been necessary during the pandemic, said Donna Deaton, a relocation specialist in the Cincinnati and Dayton, Ohio, areas. While traditional open houses are returning in some markets, she said, some property owners still prefer that shoppers make appointments. Buyers who sign up for the first available slots get to make the first offers, leaving those with later appointments out of luck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are scrambling to find homes for buyers,'' Ms. Deaton said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One problem, she said, is that some sellers are reluctant to put their homes on the market because they worry they won't be able to find a new property for themselves and will have to rent while they shop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some cases, homeowners who were planning to sell have decided to remain where they are and renovate instead, adding home offices because they expect to commute less, said David Legaz, a broker with Keller Williams in Flushing, N.Y., and the president-elect of the New York State Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are some questions and answers about the spring home-buying market:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What's happening with mortgage rates?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One bright spot for shoppers is that mortgage interest rates are near historic lows, which is helping buyers afford those pricier homes. The average rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage was 3.18 percent for the week that ended Thursday, up from 3.15 percent the previous week, according to <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, the mortgage finance giant. A year ago, the average was 3.82 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The low rates have increased the number of mortgage applications, but some borrowers may find it difficult to qualify for a home loan as banks raise their standards amid the economic turmoil of the pandemic. Borrowers can generally expect banks to require higher minimum credit scores and larger down payments, said Guy Cecala, publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance, a trade publication.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The situation is particularly challenging for first-time home buyers, who are more likely to use <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span> loans that allow lower down payments and credit scores. The F.H.A. insures loans for borrowers who put down as little as 3.5 percent if they have credit scores of at least 580. But lenders may set stricter standards, and some are requiring higher minimum scores and 10 percent or 20 percent down, Mr. Cecala said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Terms may also be tougher for borrowers at the other end of the spectrum -- those seeking ''jumbo'' loans. While banks sell most mortgages to investors, jumbo loans are typically held by the original lender. With many demands being made on their funds in an uncertain economic environment, banks are being cautious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Banks are stretched,'' said Mike Fratantoni, chief economist with the <span class="companylink">Mortgage Bankers Association</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because many people have lost jobs or been furloughed, lenders are now typically doing a second employment verification just before the closing to be sure the buyer can afford to repay the loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's hard to get a handle on someone's job situation,'' Mr. Cecala said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He advises borrowers to shop around by checking loan terms at traditional banks, finance companies like Quicken Loans and credit unions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How is being preapproved for a mortgage different from being prequalified?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's more important than ever to be preapproved for a home loan -- not just prequalified -- when shopping in many markets, agents say. Preapproved means you have submitted income information and undergone a credit check, and have been given the green light to borrow a specific amount of money. Being prequalified is more of an estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How should I prepare for a home tour?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rules vary by location, with areas hard hit by the virus returning to normal practices more gradually than other parts of the country. In New York City, in-person showings aren't expected for at least several weeks, Mr. Legaz said. For now, agents can offer a virtual tour by walking through a property while a client watches remotely -- but they can't visit with the client.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the challenge, Mr. Legaz has had three properties go under contract in the last three weeks or so, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parts of northern New York are in the second phase of the state's reopening plan, and agents can visit properties with buyers as long as they follow certain rules, said Jennifer Stevenson, president of the New York State Association of Realtors. Ms. Stevenson, a broker in Ogdensburg, said she had been showing houses since May 29.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in areas resuming on-site visits, shoppers should be prepared for differences. Masks are often required, and you'll need to limit your party to ''decision makers,'' agents say. (In other words, leave the children with a family member or sitter.) Home sellers are being advised to turn on the lights and leave interior doors open where possible to reduce the need for visitors to touch surfaces. (Agents typically walk through the house again after the tour, cleaning handles, banisters and countertops with disinfectant wipes.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's wise to do as much research online as possible to reduce the amount of time you'll need to do the walk-through.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even where visits are allowed, not all sellers are comfortable offering them. Mr. Rinehart, the broker in South Carolina, said one seller was reluctant to allow tours until the person's child goes to summer day camp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People are saying, 'Nobody is coming into the house when the kids are here,''' he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New home sales in the United States plunged 15.4 percent in March as a winding down in the middle of the month, due to the coronavirus, began to rattle the housing market. The Commerce Department reported Thursday that sales of new single-family homes dropped to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 627,000 last month after sales had fallen 4.6 percent in February. The decline was expected, though economists say it will grow much worse as the country struggles with a shutdown that has thrown millions of people out of work and disrupted wide swaths of the economy. The median price for a new home sold in March was $321,400, down 2.6 percent from a median price of $330,100 in February. By region of the country, sales fell a sharp 41.5 percent in the Northeast and were down 38.5 in the West. Both regions had states that implemented stay-at-home orders sooner than other parts of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"> ASSOCIATED PRESS TECHNOLOGY Zoom Users Hit 300M Despite Security Concerns Zoom is reporting that its user base grew by 50 percent, to 300 million, in the last three weeks, as the videoconferencing company fought to quell a backlash around security and safety that has seen a number of governments and firms ban its applications. Zoom's chief executive, Eric Yuan, gave the numbers on Wednesday in an update on the platform's 90-day security plan, while also outlining the rollout next week of a version of the app with more encryption features. The German carmaker Daimler was the latest company on Thursday to say it had banned use of Zoom for all corporate content. Zoom has also been banned by many schools around the world and Elon Musk's venture <span class="companylink">SpaceX</span>. A Zoom spokesman reiterated that companies across the world have done exhaustive security reviews of its platform and were using its services. The coronavirus-driven lockdown of millions of people globally has driven huge growth platforms like Zoom, Skype or <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>'s Teams application. REUTERS AUTOMOBILES GM Wins Court Approval Of Ignition Switch Deal General Motors won preliminary court approval of a $120 million settlement with owners who said defective ignition switches caused their vehicles to lose value. Judge Jesse Furman of the United States District Court in Manhattan granted approval at a hearing conducted by phone. The accord would resolve the last major piece of litigation over GM ignition switches linked to vehicle stalls and airbags that failed to deploy, as well as 124 deaths. Final approval is still required, after owners are notified of their rights. Since 2014, the defect has led to recalls of 2.6 million Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, GMC, Oldsmobile, Pontiac and Saturn models, dating back over a decade. The Detroit-based automaker has also paid $2.6 billion in penalties and settlements. GM would fund $70 million of the settlement, while a trust set up in connection with its 2009 bankruptcy would contribute $50 million. REUTERS</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. home sales in March dropped by the most in nearly four and a half years as efforts to control the spread of the novel coronavirus brought buyer traffic to a virtual standstill. Realtors and economists expected a further deterioration in housing market activity through the second quarter. The slump in home resales reported by the National Association of Realtors on Tuesday added to dismal March reports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales fell 8.5 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.27 million units last month. The percentage drop was the largest since November 2015. The data reflect contracts signed in February or January, before anti-virus measures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The association expected a steeper decline in sales in April and in the few months thereafter. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast existing home sales would fall 8.1 percent to a rate of 5.30 million units in March.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The penalty is part of a settlement to avoid prosecution by the Manhattan district attorney’s office, which said the auction house did not properly collect New York sales taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As part of an agreement to avoid prosecution, Christie’s will pay up to $16.7 million for failing to properly collect New York sales tax from 2013 to 2017 on private purchases made in the state or ultimately delivered there, the Manhattan district attorney’s office said on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fine comes after a yearslong investigation into the tax-collection practices of the auction house’s London-based private sales arm, as well as those of other Christie's-affiliated companies overseas — including ones in Amsterdam, Dubai and Hong Kong — conducting business with clients in New York. The settlement requires $10 million to be paid up front and the remainder to be paid in about two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to public documents describing the agreement, the tax violations arose from bureaucratic changes and flawed tax advice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2013, Christie’s started operating a separate company called Christie’s Private Sales that would centralize private purchases. When planning for the new company’s launch, prosecutors said, a senior tax adviser told executives that the new company, based in London, would not have to register to collect state and local sales tax in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time, Christie’s sales specialists expressed concern that sales at pop-up retail stores in New York were not being taxed. Even some customers questioned why tax was not being collected on their purchases, according to the documents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After in-house legal personnel in New York began objecting to the situation, the company’s general counsel announced that Christie’s Private Sales would start collecting New York sales tax, prosecutors said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But according to internal documents obtained by the district attorney’s office, a second tax adviser recommended that Christie's Private Sales avoid registering to collect sales tax in the state because it could prompt audits, funneling the tax returns through Christie’s in New York, which had long been registered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prosecutors said that other overseas offices also did not properly take in taxes. Between July 2013 and January 2017, those affiliates delivered about $189 million worth of goods in New York that should have been subject to local and state taxes, according to documents. None had registered to collect sales tax in the state until the district attorney’s office started investigating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week’s settlement required that Christie’s ensure compliance with state and local tax law by conducting an internal investigation, re-educating staff on tax policies and procedures and possibly firing certain employees. (The two tax advisers no longer worked at Christie’s as of July 2017.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christie’s said in a statement that it has worked with the district attorney’s office for years on problems stemming from the “incorrect tax advice,” and that it has since reviewed its “internal processes to ensure compliance with relevant tax law.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The January figure was revised up from an initial estimate of 764,000 but economists are warning that home sales, along with many other parts of the economy, are expected to take a big hit in coming months due to the shutdowns that have occurred to try to limit the spread of the coronavirus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ADVERTISEMENT</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report showed that the median price for a home sold in February was $345,900, up 6.3% from a median price of $325,900 in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists are forecasting big declines for the overall economy with a wave of layoffs already starting due to the big hit the economy has taken in the wake of the virus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Larry Kudlow, head of the president's National Economic Council, told reporters at the White House Tuesday that overall economic growth was ''going to be rough'' in coming months but he said that the support that the economic stimulus package that Congress is working on means ''we'll be setting the stage for a good rebound in the second half of the year.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG in New York, said, ''New home sales will likely plummet in the next few months not because of a recession per se, but the reality is the public has been told to stay in their homes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By region of the country, home sales in February surged 38.9 percent in the Northeast, a huge gain that was attributed to warmer than usual weather. Sales were up 1% in the South and fell by 17.2 percent in the West and were down 7.3% in the Midwest.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ENERGY Drilling Lease Sales Draw Few Bids Oil and gas lease sales offered by the Trump administration in three Western states on Tuesday drew few bids as a crash in energy prices tamped down interest among drillers. The <span class="companylink">Bureau of Land Management</span> received bids on just 40 percent of the 193,584 acres offered for leasing via online auctions in Wyoming, Nevada and Montana, bringing in total high bids of about $3.3 million. Wyoming, which held the largest sale -- 105 parcels covering 118,292 acres -- accounted for 99 percent of the bid total. Wyoming is the top state for gas production on federal lands and the secondbiggest for oil production, according to the <span class="companylink">U.S. Energy Information Administration</span>. Yet even there, bidding was sparse. Parcels covering just 72,000 acres received bids, and 40 percent of that acreage sold for the minimum price of $2 an acre. The average price of $46 an acre was less than half the average price of more than $100 per acre in a federal lease sales held in Wyoming last year. REUTERS</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toward Bankruptcy Exit</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
<span class="companylink">Pacific Gas &amp; Electric</span> reached an agreement Friday with Gov.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As part of the deal, <span class="companylink">PG&amp;E</span>, which filed bankruptcy last year after amassing tens of billions of dollars in debt related to wildfires caused by its equipment, will not pay dividends to shareholders for three years.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A federal judge still needs to approve the company's bankruptcy plan, but the agreement with Governor Newsom makes the approval much more likely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is the end of business as usual for <span class="companylink">PG&amp;E</span>,'' Governor Newsom said in a statement.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Governor Newsom's office said <span class="companylink">PG&amp;E</span> must receive approval of its plan by state regulators and the bankruptcy judge by the June 30 deadline and have its financing in place by Sept. 30.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, the agreement requires half of the company's new board to include California residents. An independent executive recruiting firm would select the new directors with Governor Newsom's approval.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with the added provisions secured by Governor Newsom, half of the company's $13.5 billion payment to wildfire victims will be in the form of <span class="companylink">PG&amp;E</span> stock under a previously reached agreement. Some victims have grown increasingly wary of that deal because <span class="companylink">PG&amp;E</span>'s stock, like the S&amp;P 500 index, has tumbled in recent weeks. <span class="companylink">PG&amp;E</span> shares closed at $7.22 on Friday, down from nearly $18 in mid-February.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing Home Sales Surge to 13-Year High</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes surged to a 13-year high in February, but the housing market recovery is likely to be derailed by the coronavirus pandemic, which has unleashed a wave of layoffs and left the economy teetering on the brink of a recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors on Friday said that existing home sales jumped 6.5 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.77 million units last month, the highest level since February 2007. The data reflected contracts signed in January and early February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists polled by Reuters had forecast existing home sales would rise 0.7 percent to a rate of 5.50 million units in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Existing home sales, which make up about 90 percent of home sales, accelerated 7.2 percent on a year-on-year basis in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists are expecting a recession by the second quarter, though some believe a downturn is already underway. The housing market has regained its footing as mortgage rates have declined after hitting a soft patch beginning in the first quarter of 2018 through the second quarter of 2019.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. Factory Activity Rebounded in January</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American factory activity unexpectedly rebounded in January after contracting for five straight months amid a surge in new orders, offering hope that a prolonged slump in business investment has probably bottomed out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A rebound in business investment is critical to keeping the longest economic expansion in history, now in its 11th year, on track amid signs of fatigue in consumer spending. The improvement in manufacturing reported by the <span class="companylink">Institute for Supply Management</span> on Monday likely reflected an ebb in trade tensions between the United States and China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ISM said its index of national factory activity increased to a reading of 50.9 last month, the highest level since July, from an upwardly revised 47.8 in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector. The ISM index had held below the 50 threshold for five straight months. Reuters</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Takes Unexpected Decline</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">United States construction spending unexpectedly fell in December, posting its first drop since June, as investment in both private and public projects declined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said on Monday construction spending decreased 0.2 percent. Data for November was revised up to show construction outlays rising 0.7 percent, instead of increasing 0.6 percent as previously reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending gaining 0.5 percent in December. Construction spending increased 5.0 percent on a year-on-year basis in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all of 2019, construction spending fell 0.3 percent, the first annual decline since 2011, after rising 3.3 percent in 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, spending on private construction projects slipped 0.1 percent after increasing 0.6 percent in November, and investment in public construction projects dropped 0.4 percent in December after rebounding 1.0 percent in November. Reuters</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ''significant reputational hit'' suffered by <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>'s grounded 737 Max airliner will have to be reflected in the compensation the plane maker pays <span class="companylink">Ryanair</span>, the chief executive of Europe's biggest budget airline said on Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The C.E.O., Michael O'Leary, said that as part of those talks he had made an offer for the larger, 230-seat Max 10 model, but he did not expect <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> to engage on that until the Max returns to service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Addressing his plans for compensation from <span class="companylink">Boeing</span>, Mr. O'Leary said he wanted not just to be refunded for lost traffic and lost ancillary revenue but also wanted a discount.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of the Max delays and the struggles of smaller rivals, there has been a fall in capacity in Europe, which Mr. O'Leary said looked set to provide a ''reasonably benign'' environment for fares in the coming year. Reuters</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Grammy Awards Ratings</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are Steadier Than Most</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Viewership for the Grammy Awards hit a 12-year low on Sunday night, drawing an audience of 18.7 million who watched it live on television.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is the lowest number for the Grammys since 2008. But it represents a dip of only 5 percent from last year, a modest decrease in a time when more people are switching to streaming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other awards shows have had sharp ratings decreases in recent years, but viewership for the Grammys, which is broadcast annually on <span class="companylink">CBS</span>, has remained fairly constant. The audience for Sunday night was more than the 18.3 million viewers who tuned in for the Golden Globes ceremony this month and it most likely ensures that the Grammys will finish as the second-most-watched awards program, behind the Academy Awards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of results for its streaming service, <span class="companylink">CBS</span> said on Monday that it ''marked the most-streamed Grammys on the service to date.'' John Koblin</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-Home Sales Slip</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a Steady Climb</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of newly built homes fell 0.4 percent in December, cooling slightly after low mortgage rates fueled gains for much of 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said Monday that new single-family houses sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 694,000 last month. But for all of 2019, sales climbed 10.3% to 681,000, the highest total since 2007 when 776,000 new homes were sold as the housing bubble was beginning to deflate ahead of the Great Recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year's gains were driven entirely by new homes purchased in the South and West. Sales of new homes slumped in the Northeast and Midwest in 2019.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower mortgage rates began to boost real estate sales relative to 2018. December's median new-home sales price was $331,400, up 0.5 percent from a year ago. A.P.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">India said Monday it plans to sell its entire 100 percent stake in the national carrier <span class="companylink">Air India</span> to shore up falling government revenues amid an economic slowdown, after an initial attempt last year failed to attract a single bidder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government issued a document on Monday inviting initial expressions of interest in the airline, which operates both domestic and international routes and has accumulated huge losses in the past decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The document set March 17 as the deadline for submissions and said the bidders would have to absorb 232 billion rupees, or $3.26 billion, of the airline's 580 billion-rupee debt burden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government previously had offered only 76 percent of its stake for sale, a major roadblock for many potential investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hardeep Singh Puri, the civil aviation minister, called <span class="companylink">Air India</span> a ''great asset'' whose financial position was ''fragile'' because of ballooning debts. A.P.</p>
