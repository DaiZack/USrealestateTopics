<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Newark's Ironbound district, a developer broke ground last month on a $50 million warehouse without a committed tenant -- a bold move and a sign of how much faith there is in the potential for growth in the state's industrial sector and specifically in its ports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Morris Companies, a developer based in Rutherford, N.J., is banking on the site's proximity to Port Newark, which is in the midst of a $650 million expansion, and to New York City to lure prospective tenants to the 337,000-square-foot facility that will be completed next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Port of New York and New Jersey, the third-largest in the country, is a vital industry in the region, supporting nearly 280,0000 jobs. And developers say they believe it is poised for significant growth, thanks to an expansion of the Panama Canal that is scheduled to be done in 2015. The expansion will allow much larger ships to enter New York Harbor, carrying substantially more cargo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because some of the additional goods coming off these so-called super-post-Panamax vessels will have to be distributed to the 100 million American consumers who live within a 24-hour drive of the port, and goods traveling to the ports may also need to be temporarily housed along the way, developers are hopeful that sites along New Jersey's roadways to the port will be primed to become distribution centers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This port is going to be hot. It's already hot, but it's going to get hotter,'' says Michael G. McGuinness, chief executive of the New Jersey chapter of the NAIOP, a commercial real estate trade group. ''Anybody that's in the industrial sector is probably in a good mood because they're seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To guarantee that the larger vessels will have enough clearance to enter the harbor, the <span class="companylink">Port Authority of New York and New Jersey</span> has been dredging the harbor. The agency also plans to raise the roadway on the Bayonne Bridge, a $1 billion project that will begin next year. To prepare for the increased volume, port operators have been upgrading their facilities, like the $650 million expansion at Port Newark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Expansion of the port will generate as many as 6,900 jobs a year throughout the region, according to a report by Anne Strauss-Wieder, a transportation consultant. The Morris development alone is expected to create about 200 permanent jobs. The new jobs may finally make a dent in New Jersey's unemployment rate, which was 9.8 percent in July, its highest level since 1977 and well above the national average of 8.3 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the changes on the horizon, the industrial real estate market is still recovering from the recession, and few developers have been optimistic enough to build speculative properties again. In the second quarter of 2012, the availability rate for industrial properties in New Jersey was 16 percent, down from its 2010 peak of 18 percent, but still a far cry from the prerecession rate of 11 percent, according to a report by Newmark Grubb <span class="companylink">Knight Frank</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's definitely been a slow, very gradual recovery,'' said Mitchell B. Katz, a managing director at Newmark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Companies, however, are moving into industrial space again. <span class="companylink">Amazon.com</span> plans to build two one-million-square-foot distribution centers in New Jersey. And in an industrial park in Robbinsville, N.J., about an hour south of the port, the IDS Group recently moved into half of a one-million-square-foot facility that has been vacant since the now-defunct furniture company Seamans-Levitz shut its warehouse there in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The distribution center is so large it stretches for nearly a quarter-mile, visible from the New Jersey Turnpike. On a recent afternoon, IDS workers were assembling boxes, dwarfed by the vast ceilings. Another tenant, the Global Equipment Company, signed a lease for the remaining 500,000 square feet in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far this year, the developer, the Matrix Development Group, has leased 2.5 million square feet of industrial warehouse space in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, a big improvement from 2011, when Matrix signed new leases for fewer than 500,000 square feet. Matrix manages a total of 10 million square feet of warehouse space, with tenants ranging from industrial suppliers to distributors of household goods. Despite the influx in new tenants this year, the company has yet to put a shovel in the ground again to create new space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're waiting to see who's going to pull the trigger and go,'' said James R. Murray, a vice president at Matrix.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Close to the port, there are few large facilities like the Matrix properties. The vacancy rate for 500,000-square-foot warehouses near the port is less than 1 percent, according to Mr. Katz.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Morris development in Newark is 15 minutes from the port. The development sits on a 17-acre lot with parking for 123 tractor-trailers and with a 40-door loading dock, and could bring a train line to the warehouse. The site also qualifies for the New Jersey Urban Transit Hub tax credit program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Formerly a paint facility for <span class="companylink">Sherwin-Williams</span>, the site had been contaminated. The company has nearly finished a $11.25 million environmental cleanup, clearing the way for construction. Morris is financing the $50 million project with a construction loan and expects to sign a tenant for the space before construction is complete.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's risky, but it's a sign of the ownership's confidence in the market,'' said Thomas F. Monahan, a broker at CBRE, which is marketing the property to port-related businesses and manufacturers looking for convenient access to the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least one other developer is building a speculative industrial property. Woodmont Industrial Partners paid cash for a $13.25 million distribution center in Clinton, N.J., in January, and is renovating it in hopes of attracting a port-related tenant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're feeling pretty comfortable that it won't be long before we find a tenant,'' said Eugene A. Preston, managing principal of Woodmont Industrial Partners. Woodmont Properties, a developer based in Fairfield, N.J., opened the industrial division last year to buy and redevelop industrial space in seaport markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The expansion at Port Newark is already under way. Port Newark Container Terminal, which operates the port, signed a 20-year lease with the <span class="companylink">Port Authority</span> last year, and is expanding the port to 287 acres from 180 acres. As part of the deal, the <span class="companylink">Port Authority</span> will invest $150 million in improvements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Port Newark Container Terminal will spend $500 million expanding and upgrading the terminal, anticipating that its volume will grow by as much as 5 percent over the next decade. Cargo traveling through the port will more than double by 2030, according to <span class="companylink">Port Authority</span> projections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already, the terminal has ordered new equipment and demolished warehouses along the port perimeter to make room for more containers. Earlier this month, newly paved ground was being painted and rows of containers were being moved into the new space. The company is also replacing its repair shop and office building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James J. Pelliccio, president of Port Newark Container Terminal, said: ''We have to prepare for the path of growth.''</p>
<p>Port Newark Container Terminal will expand in anticipation of much bigger ships once the expansion of the Panama Canal is completed in 2015. (PHOTOGRAPH BY JUAN ARREDONDO FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) </p>

Just off the boat from China and now being prepared for operations, the $40 million machines are part of this city's gamble that when supersize container ships start coming through the expanded Panama Canal in 2015, Baltimore will be one of the few ports on the East Coast ready for their business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We think it's going to be a major win for us,'' said James J. White, the executive director of the Maryland Port Administration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This sense that the new set of locks now being built to allow giant ships through the canal will bring riches 1,000 miles or more to the north is shared by industry and government officials along the East Coast and the Gulf of Mexico, who have been promoting multimillion- -- and in some cases multibillion- -- dollar port projects for years. The Obama administration has now moved to speed up the review process for developing and deepening the harbors for several of these ports, including those of New York and New Jersey; Charleston, S.C.; Savannah, Ga.; Jacksonville, Fla.; and Miami. The initiative ''will help drive job growth and strengthen the economy,'' President Obama said in announcing it last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some who are following the efforts have begun to express skepticism about the hope and money going into dredging mud and raising steel. With so many ports competing for a share of the bounty, experts are questioning how big that bounty will be. ''Everybody is trying to go after it -- there are going to be few beneficiaries, in my judgment,'' said William D. Ankner, a former official of the <span class="companylink">Port Authority of New York and New Jersey</span> and a former secretary of transportation for Louisiana.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big ships -- known as ''Post-Panamax'' and even ''Super-Post-Panamax'' -- are already in heavy use worldwide, making up 16 percent of the container fleet but accounting for 45 percent of its capacity, according to a July report by the Army Corps of Engineers. And ''those numbers are projected to grow significantly over the next 20 years,'' said Maj. Gen. Michael J. Walsh, deputy commanding general for civil and emergency operations for the corps, in announcing the report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the race that began when plans for the expansion were first announced in 2006, some winners have already emerged. The Port of Virginia, in Norfolk, is ready to receive the big ships today. And New York is also prepared, thanks to a massive dredging project that began 13 years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But nearly every port in the game still faces major challenges and expenses -- including the <span class="companylink">Port Authority of New York and New Jersey</span>, which plans to spend $1 billion to raise the Bayonne Bridge roadway by 64 feet to allow the giant ships through on their way to to Newark and Elizabeth, N.J.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Baltimore, which already has a 50-foot channel, has a bottleneck on the land side: the Howard Street tunnel, through which trains have to pass to reach the port, and which is too small to accommodate the double-stacked container cars that are increasingly the standard for rail shipping. The rail line CSX has announced a workaround that could cost hundreds of millions, involving a new yard beyond the tunnel filled with containers brought by truck; the port will load the trains with a single container to get through the tunnel, and the trains can be completed at the yard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Miami is putting $2 billion into improvements to its port; its dredging project was approved by the Army Corps of Engineers in April, and the city is building a tunnel costing an estimated $1 billion to create a crucial link between the port and the Interstate System of highways.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Savannah is preparing to move forward with a $652 million deepening project, while the South Carolina Legislature has committed $300 million to dredging for Charleston. A plan for the two cities to team up on a common port has all but stalled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big ships will also come via places beyond Panama: many are expected to come from Southeast Asia through the Suez Canal, and from South America's eastern ports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But more fundamental questions have been raised about the real benefits of the coming trade, and especially the effects of the new canal traffic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moving goods by water is generally cheaper than moving them by land because of the economies of scale of moving so many containers on those big ships, said John Martin, a ports consultant in Lancaster, Pa. So that would suggest canal routes will offer lower-cost shipping to the East Coast and Midwest through the canal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, he said, containers loaded on the West Coast, which has built up its container yards and highway and rail infrastructure, can outrun those that travel to the East Coast by water, and that can make the difference when speed and dependability are more important than cost alone. Besides, he added, costs and fees can shift; Panama can be expected to raise rates for canal passage, and ''the railroads are not going to sit idly by'' and let the water route undercut their business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scudder Smith, a consultant with the engineering consulting firm Parsons Brinkerhoff, said that a water passage, ''all things being equal, will cause cost reductions -- but all things are not equal,'' he added, and so ''I'm not at all confident in any numbers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That could be why J. Christopher Lytle, executive director of the Port of Long Beach, does not sound a bit worried. ''There's just not going to be a huge movement of cargo from the West Coast to the East Coast,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His port, and its counterpart in Los Angeles, are already dealing with some of the biggest vessels on the water, capable of carrying the equivalent of 13,000 container units -- vessels too big to pass through the new Panama Canal locks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After talking up port projects in ways that sound a bit like the overblown economic predictions about new stadiums and convention centers in recent years, some officials are now scaling back their claims. After Hurricane Katrina, Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi trumpeted plans for a ''port of the future'' at Gulfport with a 50-foot-deep channel, redirecting some $600 million in federal housing disaster funds on a project he pledged would spur the economy and create bountiful jobs. A state official at the time called it ''the single largest economic-development project in the state's history,'' and officials predicted that it would surpass the <span class="companylink">Port of Los Angeles</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, Mississippi and the port are being more modest. The port recently noted that it is not pursuing the announced plans to dredge the channel to 50 feet, and because of lapsed maintenance, the channel does not even reach the depth of 36 feet authorized by law. The port is now focused on improving what it has instead of expanding greatly, and plans focus more on the cascade effect as smaller ships are crowded out of the major ports by the new superships.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local critics of the original plan like Reilly Morse, policy director of Mississippi Center for Justice, said the state had been swept up in a national fad ''that promised far more economic benefits than it could deliver and risked far greater burdens on the host community than it could support.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other ports try not to overstate their goals. Mark Montgomery, the chief executive of Ports America Chesapeake, the private partner with the state of Maryland in Baltimore's project, said that his port and supporters understand that they are not likely to defeat the megaports of the West Coast, or even New York and Norfolk. Instead, he said, his port will serve Baltimore, Washington and Northern Virginia -- though he also sees it as a potential gateway to the Midwest. ''Our expectations are right-sized,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To Robert Puentes, a transportation expert at the <span class="companylink">Brookings Institution</span>, the problem of whether the ports are overbuilding for a Panama payoff is one of planning. ''We are the only industrialized country on the planet that doesn't have a comprehensive freight policy,'' he said. As for port development, he said, ''I can't see the federal government picking winners and losers'' in such a politically charged environment, but ''they could provide a little more guidance -- where right now they are providing none.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON (AP) — The number of Americans applying for unemployment edged up slightly last week but remained at a level consistent with modest gains in hiring, the Labor Department said Thursday in one of several economic reports that gave mixed signals about the nation’s economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unemployment benefit applications rose by 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 366,000, the agency said. The less volatile four-week average fell by 5,500 to 363,750, the lowest level since late March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other reports, the Commerce Department said builders broke ground on fewer homes in July than in June, but applications for building permits rose to their highest level in four years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia</span> said manufacturing in the Philadelphia region shrank for a fourth straight month. The bank said its index of regional manufacturing activity was minus 7.1 in August, which was better than in July, when it read minus 12.9. Any reading below zero indicates contraction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A measure of new orders improved slightly but still showed contraction. And an index of hiring declined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In home construction, the weakness in July came from a 6.5 percent decline in the building of single-family homes, which represent about 70 percent of the market. They fell to an annual rate of 502,000, down from a two-year high reached in June. By contrast, construction of apartments rose 12.4 percent to an annual rate of 244,000 units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But applications for building permits rose 6.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 812,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Given the strong increase in permits, the likelihood is that builders will be digging a lot more homes in the months to come,” said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors. He said that developers were taking out permits only “if they expect to put a shovel into the ground in the immediate future.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For July, total home construction rose in the Midwest but fell in all other parts of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with the gains made this year, the rate of construction and the level of permits remain only about half the 1.5 million annual rate considered healthy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists cautioned that housing was still a long way from where it should be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The housing market is getting better, but it is taking a long time,” Patrick Newport, an economist at IHS Global Insight, said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builder confidence grew this month to a five-year high, according to the <span class="companylink">National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo</span> sentiment index. The index rose to 37 from 35 in July. And many builders reported their best sales since February 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, any reading below 50 indicates negative sentiment about the housing market. The index has not been in positive territory since April 2006, the peak of the housing boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Applications for unemployment benefits have been declining in the last two months, indicating companies are laying off fewer workers and hiring is picking up. When applications fall consistently below 375,000, it generally suggests hiring is strong enough to lower the unemployment rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Claims so far in August have declined moderately compared to July, suggesting some improvement in the U.S. job environment. And that’s good news,” Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of people receiving some kind of unemployment assistance also fell, to 5.68 million for the week that ended July 28, 70,000 below the previous week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline in the number of people applying for weekly unemployment benefits has been one of several signs that the economy rebounded in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employers added 163,000 jobs in July, the most since February. Job gains averaged only 73,000 jobs a month from April through June, not enough to keep up with a rising population. The unemployment rate blipped up to 8.3 percent, from 8.2 percent.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Debra LaChance, a senior vice president at <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, spent the heyday of the condominium boom working on projects designed by celebrated architects like Jean Nouvel and Neil Denari.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when the market collapsed in 2008, ''all my new developments contracts were pulled and everything was put on hold,'' she said. ''I realized it was time for reinvention.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So Ms. LaChance began to shift her focus from apartments to deals that involved the sale of land and buildings. ''I knew development would eventually come back,'' she said. ''And the first thing the market will be looking for is land on which to build or buildings to convert.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. LaChance, who runs the eight-person team LaChance &amp; Associates at Corcoran, is one of a growing number of brokers at residential firms who are expanding into the commercial sphere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She now splits her time evenly between traditional residential sales and commercial transactions, including the recent sale of 200 Lafayette Street in SoHo, a seven-story commercial loft building, for $50 million to CIM Group and Kushner &amp; Companies, and the sale of 43-47 West 38th Street for $23 million, where the buyer, <span class="companylink">LodgeWorks</span>, demolished an existing building and is building a hotel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like many residential brokers who have crossed into commercial territory, Ms. LaChance has been involved in a range of commercial deals. Two factors are driving the trend: One is that residential brokers are continuing to look for ways to increase their revenue because the real estate market, while much improved, remains sluggish compared with the velocity and deal volume reached during the recent peak. The other is the increasing prevalence of foreign buyers, many of whom do not distinguish between residential and commercial brokers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Over the past 12 to 18 months, we have seen an influx of foreign buyers and they don't always understand the idiosyncrasies of the New York market,'' said Robert A. Knakal, chairman and founding partner of the commercial real estate brokerage Massey Knakal. ''If they want to do a commercial deal, they will often choose to go with the same broker who sold them their apartment.'' Foreign buyers, who are seeking out investments here because of turmoil in Europe and other parts of the world, are mostly focused on retail and mixed-use properties in the $20 million to $50 million range, Mr. Knakal said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason, said Max Dobens, an executive vice president and director of sales in the West Village for Prudential Douglas Elliman, is that ''it used to be all about location, location, location, but now it is all about trust. Especially with foreign buyers, they want to remain with a broker they trust.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Louis Puopolo, a broker at Prudential Douglas Elliman, had dabbled in some commercial deals, including the sale of Greenpoint Lofts in Brooklyn in 2006 and 2007, but was mostly focused on his residential business. ''Once the condo market tanked in 2008, I started getting into office leasing deals and that side of my business has continued to build,'' he said. Now, as much as 80 percent of his business consists of selling and leasing commercial office space, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a stark difference between the residential and commercial markets, Mr. Puopolo said. ''In residential, it is all about a client's personal relationship with a space and there are a lot of intangibles that have nothing to do with getting a good deal,'' he said. ''Whereas in commercial, it is purely a business transaction.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There can be a steep learning curve for residential brokers who want to diversify into commercial real estate. ''We often have to familiarize residential brokers with how the commercial process works,'' Mr. Knakal said. Differences include the fact that all due diligence on a property, such as engineering and environmental studies, must be conducted before a contract is signed rather than afterward; the specifics of a J-51 tax abatement or other programs designed for commercial properties; and knowing how to review the status of rent-regulated tenants. ''These are things that typical residential brokers may not understand, so we need to bring them up to speed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The compensation models in the two markets also vary. In the residential sales market, a seller typically pays a 6 percent commission that is split between the buyer's broker and the seller's broker. In the commercial market, the seller pays a commission that can range from 6 percent of the sales price for smaller deals to less than 1 percent for larger deals. In many cases, the commission will be split between the buyer's broker and the seller's broker, although some of the larger commercial firms will not work with other brokers or split commissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In terms of a commercial lease, the landlord typically pays a commission that is based on a percentage of the rent over the length of the lease: for example, 5 percent of the annual rent in the first year, then 4 percent in the second year and so on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It used to be that brokers would refer out a client to a commercial broker and just collect a referral fee,'' said Mr. Dobens, noting that the referral fee is often 25 percent of the commission. Lately, however, ''brokers are no longer afraid of doing a commercial deal and are willing to work for it and be more assertive.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When she was first approached about doing a commercial deal, Julia Hoagland, a senior vice president and residential sales director at Brown Harris Stevens, said she ''was hesitant about becoming a jack-of-all-trades but master of none.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Ms. Hoagland, who spent eight years on Wall Street and has an M.B.A. and an undergraduate degree in engineering, has selectively taken on some commercial deals, including the sale of commercial lofts and office leasing transactions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 15 percent of her business is now commercial, and she said she had no interest in leaving Brown Harris Stevens for a commercial brokerage: ''Why fix what isn't broken?'' she said, adding, ''there is nothing like the look on someone's face when they find the place they are going to live -- that is an intense high I do not plan to give up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But other brokers say they feel they are at a disadvantage doing commercial deals while remaining at a residential brokerage firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You need a commercial logo, an e-mail that says you represent a commercial firm, otherwise you risk losing respect and even possibly business,'' said Virginia Hildebrandt, a broker who is spearheading a new commercial division at DJK Residential, known as DJK Commercial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DJK is not the only residential firm to open a commercial division. Last month, for example, Aptsandlofts.com announced it was creating a new position, director of commercial property, to lead retail and office leasing in Brooklyn. Traditionally, the firm had focused on the borough's residential market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dobens said: ''I am a firm believer in not being the all-in-one fax machine, copier and printer that does everything but nothing well. A residential broker should be a residential broker.'' He added that it remained to be seen whether or not the business model of combining residential and commercial listings worked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, many residential brokers who have made the leap into commercial say their deep understanding of both markets is invaluable for clients. ''It is so important to understand the culture of the residents -- who lives on this block, what is their mentality?'' Mr. Puopolo said. ''If you want to do a residential conversion project, who better than a residential broker to answer those questions?''</p>

</div><div class="author">By PAUL J. LIM   </div><div>848 words</div><div>12 August 2012</div><div>NYTimes.com Feed</div><div>NYTFEED</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2012. The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AT first blush, it may look as if stocks are following a similar pattern to that of the last two years: the market sinks in the spring, then bounces back in the summer amid signs that the economy is getting past a rough patch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since late June, the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor’s</span> 500-stock index has surged 7 percent and is now nearing its post-recovery highs after faltering in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“But this rally feels very different,” said Mark R. Freeman, chief investment officer at the asset management firm Westwood Holdings Group[http://westwoodgroup.com/].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In past such rebounds, the sectors that performed the best were clearly the so-called risk-on groups — those, like financials, that are among the most economically sensitive sectors and respond well when investors are embracing riskier bets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time around, it’s been much more of a mixed bag. At the broad, sector level, defensive, “risk off” groups like telecommunications and consumer staples have outperformed the S.&amp; P. 500. But within some sectors, several economically sensitive industry groups have also been thriving. Over the last month, for instance, shares of broadcasters, apparel retailers and real estate investment trusts have also been leading the market, according to Morningstar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What does all of this say?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It tells me there’s a clear preference among investors to take on more risk, but in a more thoughtful way,” Mr. Freeman said, noting that in the last year or two, it almost seemed that a switch was flipped in the market. “Before, the attitude was, ‘Greece just got a new prime minister — let me buy the basket of stocks with the highest global cyclical exposure.’&nbsp;”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This time, “there’s greater nuance,” he said. For example, investors are noticing that the fundamentals of the United States housing market are improving, so they’re betting on stocks that will benefit from improvement in that and other areas of the domestic economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark D. Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott[http://www.janney.com/], agrees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’re not seeing that same black-and-white risk-on, risk-off modality” as in years past, he said. “Some selectivity has crept into the market.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For investors, this means that the markets could be entering a phase when stock selectivity takes on more importance. In risk-on periods in recent years, for example, “it didn’t matter if you picked Exxon or Halliburton, just as long as you were in economically sensitive stocks,” Mr. Luschini said. Today, however, “investors have to be more discerning to be rewarded.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultimately, greater stock selectivity is a healthy sign for the market, said James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management[http://www.wellscap.com/index.html]. For one thing, it means that instead of acting simply on their fears and hopes, investors are paying attention to the fundamentals, such as earnings growth and valuations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also means that there are enough signs of fundamental improvement in the economy for investors to get past their fears of another economic slowdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The employment report for July[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/04/business/economy/us-added-163000-jobs-in-july-jobless-rate-ticked-up.html?_r=1], showing that the economy had created a greater-than-expected 163,000 jobs, confirmed that the labor market was improving, albeit slowly. What’s more, bank lending and consumer confidence are rising again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Mr. Paulsen noted that for the first time during this recovery, there are real signs that the housing market is actually improving. For instance, home prices in June rose 2.5 percent over the same period in 2011, according to <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>, which tracks real estate data. Strip distressed homes from that calculation, and prices jumped 3.2 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every economic recovery in the postwar era has coincided with improvements in housing — except this one — he noted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This may finally be changing,” Mr. Paulsen said, adding that this could also bode well for the job market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EDWIN DENSON, co-manager of the William Blair Macro Allocation fund[https://www.williamblairfunds.com/funds_and_performance/individual/fundid_22/share_class_n/macro_allocation_fund/performance.fs], said that from a purely fundamental point of view, “riskier assets should continue to do well,” as the economy gradually expands in the next few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it would be foolish, Mr. Denson said, to assume that fear won’t make a comeback from time to time, given all the uncertainties ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next month, for example, the <span class="companylink">European Central Bank</span> is expected to reveal its nonstandard policy prescriptions to save the euro[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/c/currency/euro/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], which could alleviate or exacerbate fears over the region’s debt crisis[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/european_sovereign_debt_crisis/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier]. That same month, the German courts are set to rule on the constitutionality of that nation’s participation in the European Stability Mechanism, a euro zone bailout fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October and November, the focus will shift to elections in the United States. The results could sharply change the direction of federal tax policy for workers and investors, Mr. Denson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So while the worst fears of global economic disaster may be over, he added, “It’s hard to believe that it will be a smooth ride up between now and the end of the year.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON — In the latest sign that the worst might be over for the battered American housing market, the two government-controlled mortgage finance giants, Fannie Mae[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/fannie_mae/index.html?inline=nyt-org] and Freddie Mac[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/freddie_mac/index.html?inline=nyt-org], this week reported some of their best quarterly results since the real estate collapse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>posted[http://www.fanniemae.com/portal/about-us/media/financial-news/2012/5801.html] second-quarter net income of $5.1 billion. That is up from $2.7 billion in the first quarter[http://www.fanniemae.com/resources/file/ir/pdf/quarterly-annual-results/2012/q12012_release.pdf] of this year and an improvement from a net loss of $2.9 billion in the second quarter of last year[http://www.fanniemae.com/resources/file/ir/pdf/quarterly-annual-results/2012/q12012_release.pdfhttp:/www.fanniemae.com/resources/file/ir/pdf/quarterly-annual-results/2012/q12012_release.pdf]. Fannie requested no additional money from the Treasury and said it would pay a $2.9 billion dividend to taxpayers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, its brother organization, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, announced[http://www.freddiemac.com/investors/er/pdf/2012er-2q12_release.pdf] second-quarter net income of $3 billion, up from $577 million in the first quarter and a net loss of $2.1 billion in the year-ago second quarter[http://www.freddiemac.com/investors/er/pdf/2011er-2q11_release.pdf]. It also requested no additional federal aid and said it would pay a $1.8 billion dividend to the federal government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We’ve have had two very good quarters,” Timothy J. Mayopoulos, who became <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>’s chief executive in June[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/06/business/fannie-mae-names-new-chief.html], said in an interview. “In the longer term, we’re encouraged by what we see, but it’s going to be driven by factors that are bigger than we are,” including unemployment and consumer confidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mortgage giants have moved into the black as American home prices have increased, delinquency rates have continued to fall and what analysts have cautiously described[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/28/business/economy/new-indications-housing-recovery-is-under-way.html] as a housing recovery has begun to take hold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>, a real estate data firm, said that[http://www.corelogic.com/about-us/news/corelogic-june-home-price-index-rises-2.5-percentrepresenting-fourth-consecutive-year-over-year-increase.aspx] home prices rose 2.5 percent in June compared with a year ago. There has also been a surge in refinancing, as homeowners have taken advantage of record low interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“At the halfway point, 2012 is increasingly looking like the year that the residential housing market may have turned the corner,” Anand K. Nallathambi, <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>’s president, said in a statement. “While first-half gains have given way to second-half declines over the past three years, we see encouraging signs that modest price gains are supportable across the country in the second half of 2012.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both mortgage financiers said that loans made during the housing bubble — loans on which homeowners were more likely to default — were becoming smaller proportions of their portfolios. That means that the two mortgage giants expect smaller losses on bad loans and better earnings on good ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Freddie said loans that originated from 2005 to 2008 accounted for about a quarter of their portfolio of single-family mortgages, and loans originated after 2008 were more than half.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing experts caution that the increase in home prices might not augur a housing turnaround — and that further losses might still lie ahead for the Washington-based mortgage financiers. Though prices increased in June, home sales declined by 5.6 percent, the largest drop in 16 months, according to Capital Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing recovery is held back by broader economic sluggishness, analysts said. Unemployment remains stuck above 8 percent. Wage growth is sluggish. Many American households are saddled with debt. Consumer confidence is low. That means relatively few families have the means or the desire to invest in a new house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s too early to declare a national housing recovery,” said Mr. Mayopoulos. “The second half of the year is not likely to be as strong as the first half of the year. A big part of results we’re seeing came from a significant increase in home prices — and it is not clear to us that we’ll see further sustained increase in home prices for the next few quarters.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Combined, Fannie and Freddie own or guarantee about $5 trillion in American home mortgages, half of the overall market. The two financiers buy mortgages from lending banks, group them together into bonds and then sell the bonds to investors — along with a guarantee to cover losses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those guarantees meant that Fannie and Freddie started to hemorrhage money when real estate prices started to collapse in 2006. Millions of American homeowners went into foreclosure[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/f/foreclosures/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], requiring huge payouts from the financiers and necessitating a government takeover in September 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fannie and Freddie have required about $190 billion in federal assistance. They have paid back about $46 billion in dividend payments.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDEDWhen WeWork began rapidly expanding in Manhattan two years ago, the business center company initially leased four entire buildings, where it in turn prepared and rented office space to small businesses, entrepreneurs and freelancers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But at its two newest locations, WeWork went another route. Instead of leasing an entire building, the company leased an independent chunk of space with its own entrance, lobby and elevators within an office building, a situation often referred to in the real estate industry as ''a building within a building.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That way, WeWork gets all the benefits of leasing or owning a building -- such as reinforcing its identity with exterior signs and controlling its security -- but possibly at a lower price, real estate brokers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WeWork's newest offices are at 175 Varick Street in SoHo, where rents are about $40 a square foot, and 261 Madison Avenue in Midtown, with asking rents of about $46 a square foot. The rates do not differ much from what it pays elsewhere, but it can have the perks a landlord can provide to a larger building without sacrificing privacy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Office buildings with a building-within-a-building feature can be few and far between, real estate brokers said. Some examples, which range from high-rise towers to warehouse buildings, include: 330 Madison Avenue, Park Avenue Tower and 469 Seventh Avenue, all in Midtown; 11 Madison Avenue in Midtown South; 80 West End Avenue on the Upper West Side; and 550 Washington Street in Lower Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tenants with separate entrances in these buildings have more privacy while benefiting from being in a larger building that can provide shared amenities, like a cafeteria. Landlords, in turn, can rely on having larger tenants, who might be willing to sign longer-term leases and who might eventually expand in the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While WeWork's new location in SoHo is being retrofitted to create a second lobby and an entrance from what originally was a loading dock and an unimposing side entrance, some buildings have been designed to accommodate a building within a building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Extell Development Company's International Gem Tower at 50 West 47th Street in Midtown, for example, was constructed with a building within a building as an option, and Extell recently decided to set aside a total of 292,000 square feet on floors 22 through 34 to be leased as a chunk of space with its own lobby, elevators and entrance at 55 West 46th Street, said Alan Wildes, an executive director with the commercial brokerage Cushman &amp; Wakefield, who is leasing the space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While most of the space in the International Gem Tower had been sold as commercial condominiums, Mr. Wildes said that a shift in the commercial office market, in which tenants have embarked on a ''flight to quality'' in search of buildings with better service, security and amenities, persuaded the owners to lease the remaining space in the tower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The building-within-a-building concept has become more in vogue, because you're able to accommodate higher-traffic tenancies and tenancies that wish to have their own identity or a little more exclusivity,'' he said. ''It's become in vogue, especially as landlords try to recapture space that otherwise was not being used to its highest and best use.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not only will the space at 55 West 46th have its own entrance, lobby and elevators, it is also separate operationally, so tenants can control their electricity use, heating, ventilation and air-conditioning. Rents start around $95 a square foot. ''The type of situation we offer really has to be planned ahead of time,'' Mr. Wildes said. ''It's a lot more difficult to be able to retrofit a building.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another tower that was planned in the early 1980s as a building within a building is the 17-story Forest Hills Tower at 118-35 Queens Boulevard in Queens. Initially, ConEdison leased the 225,000-square-foot building within a building, followed by the cable company RCN Corporation and then JetBlue, said Kenneth Siegel, a managing director with the commercial brokerage Jones Lang LaSalle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a fairly unique situation,'' Mr. Siegel said. ''Not only does the tenant get the identity and the entrance, but then they also get to potentially operate the building, run their systems and be able to manage their costs that way as well.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One tenant benefit of the building-within-a-building feature is the ability to expand without having to go outside the building, he said. As it grew, JetBlue took two additional floors in the Forest Hills Tower, before moving to a different location this spring, he said. ''One of the clear benefits of doing something like this is tenants need to change over time,'' he said. ''If the tenant rents a whole building somewhere, they've got to go outside'' if they need more space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another benefit to a tenant taking a building within a building is that a company can often stay on fewer floors, thus remaining less vertical and more collaborative than it would be in its own building, Mr. Siegel said. ''Most tenants tend to rather be on fewer floors than more floors,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because a tenant taking a building within a building is in a larger building with other tenants, a critical mass is possible to make it financially feasible for the landlord to provide more amenities, Mr. Siegel said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Landlords enjoy clear benefits too, which is one reason some landlords are considering offering buildings within a building, said Glenn Markman, an executive vice president with Cushman &amp; Wakefield, who has consulted on three conversions of office towers to a building-within-a-building format, the latest at Two MetroTech Center in Brooklyn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides recapturing space that is not fully used, landlords can control the flow of traffic better, he said. A higher-traffic tenant can have its own lobby and elevators, minimizing wear on the building's main lobby and elevators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the tenants that might take a building in a building tend to be larger, they may stay in place longer, particularly if the space has been highly customized, he said. At Two MetroTech, the Polytechnic Institute of New York University signed a 15-year lease for about 90,000 square feet on two floors with a separate entrance, lobby and elevators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The university's entrance and lobby are in a storefront space that had been vacant and that is around the corner from the main entrance. The university's two floors will house administrative and faculty offices, but also classrooms, which will require changing of its certificate of occupancy, Mr. Markman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These leases tend to be long, but the landlord will have maybe a more leasable building the next go-around, since you've set up the building-within-a-building concept,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The conversion of 75,000 square feet of 175 Varick into a building in a building worked because the structure had a side-street freight entrance that was not fully used and had little retail value, said Martin Meyer, a vice chairman at the commercial brokerage Colliers International, who consulted on the conversion. He said that the concept generally works better in a corner building or one with a side-street entrance, because landlords would be reluctant to give up a prime retail site for a second entrance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WeWork is renovating its 3,000-square-foot lobby off Charleton Street to provide a loungelike atmosphere with a pool table and games, plus a small restaurant for its members, said Adam Neumann, a co-founder of WeWork. The lobby will capture the identity of WeWork, which is anticorporate and countercultural, and let its members move in and out of the building in a secure fashion, he said. The building's main lobby is much simpler, with little more than a security desk and the building's original Art Deco design.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He described WeWork's lobby as ''cool and collaborative -- different from any lobby that's ever existed in the city.'' He said his company is ''excited to be able to curate and control the environment that we create, because most lobbies in the city all look the same.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SEATTLE -- For the first few years of its existence, the only thing Zillow cared about was getting people to come to its real estate Web site to snoop on the market value of neighbors' homes and other properties. Over 34 million visitors a month now do so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last 18 months, though, Zillow has lavished its attention on a different audience: real estate agents. It has created one service that lets them build their own Web sites, one for broadcasting their property listings and another for managing communications with home seekers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There used to be a clearer line between Internet companies that catered to consumers and those that served businesses. The market was neatly divided between the unglamorous business-to-business or B2B companies, operating mostly out of public view, and the flashier business-to-consumer or B2C companies. But with Zillow and a wave of similar firms, that distinction is fading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LinkedIn, <span class="companylink">Groupon</span> and <span class="companylink">GrubHub</span> -- consumer services that help people advertise their talents, find daily deals and order takeout food -- are among the companies seeking to burrow more deeply into the operations of businesses in their respective markets. Some companies, like Zillow, are shifting toward business clients well after they were begun. For others, it has been part of the plan from the beginning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, most consumer Internet companies have long had relationships of some kind with other businesses. <span class="companylink">Amazon.com</span> works with thousands of manufacturers and with sellers who use its site as a storefront. <span class="companylink">EBay</span>, initially known as a marketplace for individuals to peddle collectibles and other goods, now has plenty of businesses that sell on its site. Then there are the businesses to which <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, <span class="companylink">Google</span> and <span class="companylink">Yahoo</span> sell advertising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But consumer Internet companies of the newer generation are doing even more. In many cases, the tools they are providing businesses resemble specialized versions of so-called customer relationship management services from companies like <span class="companylink">Salesforce.com</span>, which help businesses increase sales and keep track of communications with clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By moving in this direction, consumer Internet companies hope to tap potentially rich new sources of revenue, which could make them more attractive to investors. A company that gets business clients to depend on a broad set of its services can make it tougher for competitors to swipe its customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You can't just sell advertising without being exposed to someone else undercutting you on price,'' said Spencer Rascoff, chief executive of Zillow. ''If you sell ads plus services, you're in a more defensible position.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bill Gurley, a Zillow board member and venture capitalist, has seen enough hybrid Internet companies that serve both businesses and consumers that he coined a term to describe them: B2B2C. ''We're moving from a day and age where you're just a Web site to one where we're automating the connections between businesses and consumers,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gurley's firm, <span class="companylink">Benchmark Capital</span>, has invested in several other companies he puts in that camp, including Uber, which offers a mobile app that lets consumers hail a town car and gives drivers a ''heat map'' highlighting the areas where they are most likely to find customers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">GrubHub</span>, another one of his investments, lets consumers order takeout and delivery food from more than 15,000 restaurants online and through mobile apps. In many cases, the service uses a clunky system in which customer orders are sent to restaurants by fax and confirmed by phone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, though, <span class="companylink">GrubHub</span> introduced a product called OrderHub that could allow it to become more entwined in restaurants' operations. OrderHub is a tablet computer running <span class="companylink">Google</span>'s Android operating system that lets restaurants receive orders electronically, confirm them with a couple of taps and improve the accuracy of delivery time estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">GrubHub</span> is giving free tablets to restaurants, which pay a commission for orders received through the system. About 500 restaurants in Chicago and 500 in New York have the devices now, according to the company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LinkedIn, meanwhile, is finding success in helping human resources departments manage recruiting. The site started as a place where people could advertise themselves professionally and build a network of contacts. Soon corporate recruiters began using LinkedIn to look for new hires.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LinkedIn eventually began selling recruiters a service, which can cost up to $8,000 a year, that offers improved search capabilities and the ability to contact a broader range of job candidates through the site. A recent addition to that service, called Talent Pipeline, allows human resources departments to track candidates' progress through the hiring process, from the submission of resumes to in-person interviews. More than half of LinkedIn's revenue now comes from such recruiting services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Over time, we've gotten more sophisticated with how we serve organizations,'' said Daniel Shapero, vice president for hiring solutions at LinkedIn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some cases, analysts say the effort by consumer Internet companies to become more cozy with businesses seemed a little dubious. One example is <span class="companylink">Groupon</span>, a company known for its daily e-mail offers, which has had disappointing financial results and whose share price has plummeted nearly 75 percent since it went public last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a letter to shareholders in May, the company's chief executive, Andrew Mason, described a new mission through which the company planned to ''become the operating system for local commerce.'' Among the initiatives he mentioned was a new online system called Scheduler that allows local merchants to book appointments, which he said would eventually evolve into a way for merchants to perform ''yield management,'' a system airlines have long used to price seats based on demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Scheduler embodies our intent to provide every mom-and-pop store with powerful technology solutions that were once reserved for sophisticated corporations with multimillion-dollar budgets,'' Mr. Mason wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jordan Rohan, an analyst with <span class="companylink">Stifel Nicolaus</span>, said he thought <span class="companylink">Groupon</span> was trying to position itself as a software-as-a-service company, because the stocks of such companies have performed much better than those of most consumer Internet companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They're not a software company,'' Mr. Rohan said. ''They might say they are, but they're not. It's mostly buzzwords.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Julie Mossler, a spokeswoman for <span class="companylink">Groupon</span>, declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zillow's effort to court businesses seems to be going more smoothly. In an interview at the company's headquarters in a high-rise overlooking Elliott Bay in Seattle, Mr. Rascoff said Zillow had initially introduced a more straightforward plan to sell advertising to real estate agents, allowing them to buy ''premier agent'' advertising slots for specific ZIP codes so their names and contact information would appear when someone entered the address of a property on Zillow's Web site or mobile app. The advertising fees vary by area, but range from $200 to $300 a month on average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eventually, Mr. Rascoff realized that many agents wanted more than just advertising to help them convert home shoppers and sellers into commission-paying customers. In the last couple of years, Zillow has acquired three companies that provide tools aimed at real estate professionals, including a service for managing rental listings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some real estate professionals and homeowners question the accuracy of its home value estimates, they continue to be a big draw for consumers. (Zillow said the accuracy of its estimates varied by location and improved with more data about home sales.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Julia Carnahan, a real estate agent with <span class="companylink">Keller Williams Realty</span> in San Antonio, said she has spent several thousand dollars a month to advertise on Zillow and also has used Diverse Solutions, one of the companies Zillow acquired, to maintain a Web site with her own property listings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Carnahan said she would use more services from Zillow as they became more sophisticated. ''If they offered tools that helped me complete more business,'' she said, ''they would certainly capture more of my money.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction Appended</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SILVER SPRING, Md. — Faced with diminishing membership and revenues, organized labor is selling the site of its accredited institution of higher learning, the National Labor College, on 47 prime acres ripe for development just off the Capital Beltway here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The campus, which was purchased by the A.F.L.-C.I.O. about 40 years ago, is 10 miles from the White House and a mile from the Food and Drug Administration, which recently consolidated its offices from 27 separate buildings elsewhere in Montgomery County.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decision to sell reflects the decline of organized labor’s finances as well as the college’s shift to mostly online courses. The college also has been having financial difficulties, which were worsened last fall when a partnership on distance learning with the for-profit Princeton Review came apart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The college has been running annual deficits of more than $6 million. The A.F.L.-C.I.O. has heavily subsidized the college to keep it running, making the potential sale a welcome financial shot in the arm for the labor federation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This spring, the college chose Transwestern, a national commercial real estate company, to market the property as a tract that will be sold “free and clear of all debt” and as a “gateway” to the New Hampshire[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/great-homes-and-destinations/destinations/new-england/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] Avenue corridor, where the F.D.A. is. The property is eligible for rezoning that would allow for up to two million square feet of commercial and residential use, but the sale would not be contingent on zoning or planning approvals, a process that could take many months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The successful bidder would “hopefully integrate commercial, residential, entertainment,” said Patricia Earnest, a broker involved in the sale and an adviser to PRC, LLC. “It’s a premier site. It has been broadly marketed, not just to developers but to companies interested in being near the F.D.A.,” including big pharmaceutical and health care companies. Others who have been solicited or who have expressed interest include a mix of retail groups, regional and national developers, apartment builders and universities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The groups must be amenable to buying the property as is and closing by end of year,” she said. The property is assessed by the state of Maryland at $45 million, but the college put no minimum bid in its request for proposals. Located on the campus are 10 academic, faculty and residential buildings, including the 72,000-square-foot Lane Kirkland Center, which was the centerpiece of a $30 million building program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 300 entities filed statements of interest, and offers were due July 9, resulting in at least four bids, but college officials say the deadline is flexible and more bids are expected. One proposal is for a high-end retail outlet center for name brands like Prada, according to person with knowledge of the bids who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to release the information.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Complicating the sale, however, is a Montgomery County “master plan” for the area that is now being developed and that could permit up to two million square feet of commercial and residential use on the college site. Current zoning allows only single-family homes, but the college had been granted a special exception as an educational institution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But first there must be planning staff recommendations, public hearings and approvals by the county council, all of which is expected to drag on into next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bidders are “well aware,” of the zoning hurdles, said William Lurye, associate general counsel of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. “We would assume they are sophisticated bidders who’ve made their own assessment.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Glenn Kreger, the chief planner for this section of the county, said: “A potential purchaser is taking their chances. Anybody can apply for rezoning, it doesn’t mean they’re going to get it. There is a lot of risk involved, no doubt about it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paula Peinovich, president of the labor college, declined to be interviewed. However, in an interview this spring with Inside Higher Ed,[http://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2012/04/10/national-labor-college-will-sell-its-campus] an online news site, she said the decision was “very hard” and “not something the board of the college has chosen to do lightly.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But faced with financial issues, she said, “the board is going to focus on the college,” which will retain its accreditation and which will continue to offer courses, largely online, at a location to be determined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It’s a big failure on the part of the labor movement,” said Greg W. Giebel, the school’s first provost and until recently president of its adjunct faculty union. “It certainly is not what was intended as I knew it. The dream was we were to be the West Point of the labor unions.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The A.F.L.-C.I.O. acquired the tract, formerly owned by the Xaverian Brothers, a Roman Catholic order, in 1971 for $2.5 million. Shortly after, it became the George Meany Center for Labor Studies, for union leaders and rank-and-file members, and began offering degree programs in affiliation with <span class="companylink">Antioch College</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It became an independent degree-granting institution in 1997. Seven years later, it won accreditation by the Middle States Association, renewed for 10 years in 2010. The college opened its modern conference center named for Lane Kirkland, the former A.F.L.-C.I.O. president, in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2010, the college dedicated a Workers Memorial, a structure consisting of thousands of bricks, each with the name of a worker who died from work-related causes. In addition, the college houses the federation’s labor archives. The relocation of the archives and memorial has not yet been decided.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The college borrowed heavily to construct the Kirkland Center and make other capital improvements. In 2010, the last year for which tax returns are available, the college owed $27.3 million. The A.F.L.-C.I.O. has been pumping in about $5 million annually to support operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The labor college has been in financial trouble for a while,” said Kate Bronfenbrenner, director of labor education research at Cornell University. “And a big part of it was the split in the A.F.L.-C.I.O.,” when several large unions left the labor federation in 2005. She added that the A.F.L.-C.I.O. no longer felt it could continue to financially support the college.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The college could not sustain itself, despite its recent emphasis on online education and its relatively new conference center. “They invested for a future that didn’t happen,” said Ms. Bronfenbrenner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: August 2, 2012, Thursday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article in the Square Feet pages on Wednesday about plans to sell the campus of the National Labor College in Silver Spring, Md. misstated the financial relationship between the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the college. The labor organization heavily subsidizes the college, but does not own it. And it is not the case that the A.F.L.-C.I.O. would receive revenue from the sale. The article also gave an outdated professional association for Patricia Earnest, a broker involved in the sale. She is an adviser to PRC, LLC; she is no longer a broker for Transwestern.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices rose for the fourth month in a row in May, suggesting the recovery in the housing market continued to gain traction even as other economic indicators showed signs of weakness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other data on Tuesday indicated consumer confidence unexpectedly rose in July but spending fell in June for the first time in nearly a year as Americans saved more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report on home prices, the S.&amp; P./Case-Shiller composite index of 20 metropolitan areas, gained 0.9 percent in May from April on a seasonally adjusted basis, exceeding economists’ expectations for a 0.5 percent gain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market, which collapsed in the 2007-9 recession[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/r/recession_and_depression/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], has been a relatively bright spot in the economy this year, although it remains hobbled by tight mortgage availability and continuing foreclosures[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/f/foreclosures/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Real estate continues to show improvement off the bottom,” said Subodh Kumar, an investment strategist at Subodh Kumar &amp; Associates in Toronto. “That’s one of the few encouraging signs we’ve seen.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a nonseasonally adjusted basis, prices fared even better, rising 2.2 percent. Compared with a year ago, price declines moderated, slipping 0.7 percent, which was the smallest drop since the last time year-over-year prices rose in September 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer spending, which makes up about 70 percent of economic activity in the nation, fell 0.1 percent in June after adjustment for rising prices, the Commerce Department said in a separate report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Consumers are afraid,” said Matthew Lifson, an analyst at Cambridge Mercantile Group in Princeton, N.J. “This data suggests that the U.S. economy is stagnant over all, and it’s just muddling.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before adjustment for inflation, spending was flat, slightly less than forecasts for a 0.1 percent increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Household income rose in June by 0.5 percent, the most in three months, but consumers kept extra cash by saving more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With price-adjusted incomes rising in June and consumption falling, the saving rate for households rose to 4.4 percent, its highest level in a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, consumers’ moods have not completely deteriorated, and a separate gauge showed confidence unexpectedly rose in July as Americans were more optimistic about the short-term outlook than they were about their current situations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conference Board Consumer Research Center said its index of consumer attitudes climbed to 65.9 from a upwardly revised 62.7 in June. Recent strength in the stock market probably was the reason, economists said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the improvement, confidence remains well below levels recorded before the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Given the current economic environment, in particular the weak labor market, consumer confidence is not likely to gain any significant momentum in the coming months,” Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board, said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the manufacturing sector, the rate of business activity in the Midwest rose in July, as somewhat stronger new orders offset a weakening environment for labor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago business barometer rose to 53.7 from 52.9 in June. The report was released a day before two larger national manufacturing reports.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SILVER SPRING, Md. -- Faced with diminishing membership and revenues, organized labor is selling the site of its accredited institution of higher learning, the National Labor College, on 47 prime acres ripe for development just off the Capital Beltway here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The campus, which was purchased by the A.F.L.-C.I.O. about 40 years ago, is 10 miles from the White House and a mile from the Food and Drug Administration, which recently consolidated its offices from 27 separate buildings elsewhere in Montgomery County.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decision to sell reflects the decline of organized labor's finances as well as the college's shift to mostly online courses. The college also has been having financial difficulties, which were worsened last fall when a partnership on distance learning with the for-profit Princeton Review came apart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The college has been running annual deficits of more than $6 million. The A.F.L.-C.I.O. has heavily subsidized the college to keep it running, making the potential sale a welcome financial shot in the arm for the labor federation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This spring, the college chose Transwestern, a national commercial real estate company, to market the property as a tract that will be sold ''free and clear of all debt'' and as a ''gateway'' to the New Hampshire Avenue corridor, where the F.D.A. is. The property is eligible for rezoning that would allow for up to two million square feet of commercial and residential use, but the sale would not be contingent on zoning or planning approvals, a process that could take many months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The successful bidder would ''hopefully integrate commercial, residential, entertainment,'' said Patricia Earnest, a broker involved in the sale and an adviser to PRC, LLC. ''It's a premier site. It has been broadly marketed, not just to developers but to companies interested in being near the F.D.A.,'' including big pharmaceutical and health care companies. Others who have been solicited or who have expressed interest include a mix of retail groups, regional and national developers, apartment builders and universities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The groups must be amenable to buying the property as is and closing by end of year,'' she said. The property is assessed by the state of Maryland at $45 million, but the college put no minimum bid in its request for proposals. Located on the campus are 10 academic, faculty and residential buildings, including the 72,000-square-foot Lane Kirkland Center, which was the centerpiece of a $30 million building program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 300 entities filed statements of interest, and offers were due July 9, resulting in at least four bids, but college officials say the deadline is flexible and more bids are expected. One proposal is for a high-end retail outlet center for name brands like Prada, according to person with knowledge of the bids who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to release the information.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Complicating the sale, however, is a Montgomery County ''master plan'' for the area that is now being developed and that could permit up to two million square feet of commercial and residential use on the college site. Current zoning allows only single-family homes, but the college had been granted a special exception as an educational institution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But first there must be planning staff recommendations, public hearings and approvals by the county council, all of which is expected to drag on into next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bidders are ''well aware,'' of the zoning hurdles, said William Lurye, associate general counsel of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. ''We would assume they are sophisticated bidders who've made their own assessment.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Glenn Kreger, the chief planner for this section of the county, said: ''A potential purchaser is taking their chances. Anybody can apply for rezoning, it doesn't mean they're going to get it. There is a lot of risk involved, no doubt about it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paula Peinovich, president of the labor college, declined to be interviewed. However, in an interview this spring with Inside Higher Ed, an online news site, she said the decision was ''very hard'' and ''not something the board of the college has chosen to do lightly.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But faced with financial issues, she said, ''the board is going to focus on the college,'' which will retain its accreditation and which will continue to offer courses, largely online, at a location to be determined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a big failure on the part of the labor movement,'' said Greg W. Giebel, the school's first provost and until recently president of its adjunct faculty union. ''It certainly is not what was intended as I knew it. The dream was we were to be the West Point of the labor unions.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The A.F.L.-C.I.O. acquired the tract, formerly owned by the Xaverian Brothers, a Roman Catholic order, in 1971 for $2.5 million. Shortly after, it became the George Meany Center for Labor Studies, for union leaders and rank-and-file members, and began offering degree programs in affiliation with <span class="companylink">Antioch College</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It became an independent degree-granting institution in 1997. Seven years later, it won accreditation by the Middle States Association, renewed for 10 years in 2010. The college opened its modern conference center named for Lane Kirkland, the former A.F.L.-C.I.O. president, in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2010, the college dedicated a Workers Memorial, a structure consisting of thousands of bricks, each with the name of a worker who died from work-related causes. In addition, the college houses the federation's labor archives. The relocation of the archives and memorial has not yet been decided.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The college borrowed heavily to construct the Kirkland Center and make other capital improvements. In 2010, the last year for which tax returns are available, the college owed $27.3 million. The A.F.L.-C.I.O. has been pumping in about $5 million annually to support operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The labor college has been in financial trouble for a while,'' said Kate Bronfenbrenner, director of labor education research at Cornell University. ''And a big part of it was the split in the A.F.L.-C.I.O.,'' when several large unions left the labor federation in 2005. She added that the A.F.L.-C.I.O. no longer felt it could continue to financially support the college.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The college could not sustain itself, despite its recent emphasis on online education and its relatively new conference center. ''They invested for a future that didn't happen,'' said Ms. Bronfenbrenner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: August 2, 2012, Thursday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article in the Square Feet pages on Wednesday about plans to sell the campus of the National Labor College in Silver Spring, Md. misstated the financial relationship between the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the college. The labor organization heavily subsidizes the college, but does not own it. And it is not the case that the A.F.L.-C.I.O. would receive revenue from the sale. The article also gave an outdated professional association for Patricia Earnest, a broker involved in the sale. She is an adviser to PRC, LLC; she is no longer a broker for Transwestern.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real estate market has not been kind in recent months to the World Financial Center, the four glass-and-granite office towers in Battery Park City in Lower Manhattan that were designed in the 1980s by Cesar Pelli to evoke the skyscrapers of the 1920s and 1930s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three large tenants, Nomura, Deloitte and <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>, have given up all or most of their office space in the eight-million-square-foot complex and defected for Midtown. The entertainment giant <span class="companylink">Viacom</span> came tantalizingly close to taking a large chunk of the vacant space but decided last spring to expand its offices in Times Square instead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So just as two towers are finally nearing completion at the World Trade Center -- adding substantially to the Lower Manhattan office inventory -- <span class="companylink">Brookfield Office Properties</span>, the publicly traded owner of the World Financial Center, finds itself trying to fill three million square feet, most of it currently leased by <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> for its <span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span> unit. The bank is moving most of these offices to its tower at One Bryant Park on 42nd Street and the Avenue of the Americas, and has renewed only 800,000 square feet of its original 2.7 million square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To attract new tenants -- and hopefully broaden the complex's appeal beyond the financial services industry to technology and entertainment companies -- Brookfield has embarked on a $250 million renovation, which is expected to be completed by 2014 and is being designed by Mr. Pelli and his son Rafael Pelli.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The makeover is intended to enhance the center's lackluster entrances, shops and restaurants and give it an airier feel more in keeping with its glossy new neighbors -- the <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> building at 200 West Street, directly to the north, and the World Trade Center buildings rising to the east. The company says the redesign will also enable the complex to take better advantage of its most prized asset, five acres of outdoor space along the North Cove Marina, with views of the Hudson River and the Statue of Liberty. Brookfield regularly stages free outdoor concerts there, including a recent performance by the blues legend Buddy Guy, which drew a crowd of 8,000 on a warm July night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dennis Friedrich, who was named Brookfield's chief executive in May, said the changes at the World Financial Center were a response to the generational shift in the work force. ''The new worker is attracted to natural light, green spaces and access to the waterfront,'' Mr. Friedrich said. He said the redesign was also intended to make the center more welcoming to the surrounding residential community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new two-story glass entry pavilion on West Street will allow people to enter the complex at street level, though most will arrive through passageways evocative of air terminals that will run under West Street and connect to the long-awaited transportation hubs at the World Trade Center and Fulton Street. The pavilion will replace the glass facade the Pellis designed for the Winter Garden after the bridge connecting it to the World Trade Center was destroyed in the 2001 terrorist attack.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plans also call for a transformation of the cluttered-looking corridor leading from Vesey Street to the Winter Garden into a sleek shopping center offering what David Cheikin, the vice president in charge of leasing, describes as ''hip luxury.'' The current tenants, including the restaurants Cosi and Devon &amp; Blakely, were induced to give up their leases, a process that required ''years of brutal effort,'' Mr. Cheikin said. The brass-framed canopies delineating separate eating areas -- a feature that was not part of Mr. Pelli's design -- will be removed. ''The space has all been reconfigured,'' Mr. Pelli said. ''It will be a much more intense shopping experience.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the side facing the river, Brookfield is planning to install a 25,000-square-foot food market in the style of Eataly, the Italian marketplace in the Flatiron district, but with an emphasis on seafood and fresh produce. An open dining area operated by 14 restaurateurs will fill the second floor, and six separate restaurants will be added. Brokers say Lower Manhattan is badly in need of more stores and restaurants, given the growing residential population, the new office towers and the explosion in tourism resulting from the opening of the World Trade Center memorial. ''The retailers down there now are doing well,'' said Benjamin Fox, executive vice president of retail leasing at Massey Knakal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the retail spaces are expected to be an easy sell, filling the office space there is likely to be more daunting, at least for the next few years, real estate specialists said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Brookfield is very strong on the leasing side,'' said Michael Knott, a managing director at Green Street Advisors, a research company in Newport Beach, Calif. ''But the enormity of the challenge at this time seems to be pretty striking.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 12 percent of the prime office space in Lower Manhattan is currently available for occupancy within the coming year -- a figure that will spike to 15 percent within the next few months, said Steve Coutts, a senior vice president at Studley, a brokerage that represents tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financial services still dominate the Lower Manhattan office market but make up an increasingly smaller proportion -- 46 percent, compared to 57 percent in 2005, according to <span class="companylink">CBRE Group</span>. But though millions of square feet of leases are expiring in the next few years, there are no signs that other large companies plan to follow the departing World Financial Center tenants to Midtown. ''I don't hear anyone talking about defecting for Midtown,'' said Peter Riguardi, president for New York operations at <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>. ''That situation is quiet now.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And brokers say they are encouraged that 19 tenants from Midtown and the neighborhood below Grand Central Terminal to Canal Street known as Midtown South have signed leases downtown in recent months for 25,000 square feet or more, for a total of 2.9 million square feet. The largest are the media company Conde Nast at One World Trade Center, the investment firm <span class="companylink">Oppenheimer &amp; Company</span> at 85 Broad Street and the law firm <span class="companylink">Wilmer Hale</span> at 7 World Trade Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A <span class="companylink">Viacom</span> migration to either the World Financial Center or the World Trade Center, from Times Square, would have given the neighborhood a big boost, real estate specialists say. But in April, the entertainment conglomerate decided to remain at 1515 Broadway and eventually take over all of the building. In exchange, the landlord, <span class="companylink">SL Green Realty Corporation</span>, agreed to extensively upgrade the building, said Steven M. Durels, director of leasing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Landlords and brokers say the neighborhood is likely to benefit from the success of Midtown South, where rents have climbed rapidly in recent months. The average annual asking rent for prime space there in the second quarter of this year was $67.99 a square foot, compared to $72.88 for Midtown itself, according to <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>. In downtown, the average asking rent was $45.51.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sheldon L. Cohen, a senior managing director at <span class="companylink">CBRE Group</span>, said that clients who never would have considered Lower Manhattan before are looking there now. ''Midtown South is an enormously tight market,'' he said. ''We are starting to see some spillover.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Friedrich of Brookfield said World Financial Center would be debt-free by 2014 and could charge lower rents than the new World Trade Center towers. The asking rent for most of the space at the World Financial Center is in the $50-a-square-foot range, brokers said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO </div><div>1375 words</div><div>29 July 2012</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2012 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EVEN though sales of pricey, high-end apartments tend to get the most attention, New York at its core is a city of renters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 75 percent of Manhattan dwellers write monthly checks to the landlord. While it can sound odd to talk about the advantages of renting in a city that is prohibitively expensive for most Americans, there are benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Renters don't have to lay down massive deposits, suffer the headache of dealing with condo and co-op boards, or pay taxes, common charges and big repair bills after signing away their savings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of us have no choice but to rent, given the hefty deposits required. But in the world of high-end real estate, there are some renters who clearly can afford to buy multimillion-dollar residences but choose to rent instead. They're a small segment of the market, these ''super renters.'' Or, given some of the new rental properties -- including the penthouses at New York by Gehry at 8 Spruce Street -- perhaps it's better to call them ''sky-high renters.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Starting in September, the development, which is currently one of the tallest residential structures in the Americas at 870 feet, hopes to rent the three penthouses on the 76th floor for $45,000 to $60,000 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For those doing the quick math, that means an annual cash outlay of $720,000 for the largest, north-facing penthouse, which is 3,800 square feet spread over four bedrooms, or about $16 per square foot per month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Will they get any takers? Especially when the undulating window design by the starchitect Frank Gehry lets you see and be seen by your penthouse neighbor, and possibly even by a neighbor below? These are some of the questions that arose from my tour of the penthouses this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The monthly rent might seem shocking to some. But as I learned, there are already enough renters in New York City paying more than $30,000 a month that some real estate brokers actually specialize in renting to the very wealthy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dennis Hughes, a broker with Corcoran, is one of them. In April he rented an apartment on Broadway in SoHo, which is owned by an actor, to a foreign couple for $40,000 a month. It is a 4,000-square-foot home with three bedrooms and a home office. It is the renter's third residence in the United States, and the other two are in Texas and Beverly Hills. ''They do not own anything in the U.S.,'' Mr. Hughes said. ''They prefer for tax reasons to rent.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has also been trying to help an investment banker from New York to land an 8,000-square-foot apartment in Carnegie Hill. The banker, who bid $100,000 a month after the owner asked for $135,000, is waiting to hear back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A good number of town houses are renting for more than $50,000 a month, and some penthouses in condo buildings are also going for $50,000 or more, brokers say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are so many different scenarios why people choose to rent and not buy,'' Mr. Hughes said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But one overarching reason is that the wealthy often don't want to downgrade their lifestyle, even briefly. A movie actor from Los Angeles recently rented a 3,200-square-foot apartment on the Upper East Side for more than $33,000 a month while he appears in a Broadway show. Another investment-banker client is willing to spend as much as $100,000 a month on a rental while he searches for a large home to buy in the area, Mr. Hughes said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Top athletes and musicians who live a lot of their lives on the road often choose the convenience of renting, at least for a while. Alex Rodriguez of the <span class="companylink">New York Yankees</span> paid $30,000 a month in 2009 and 2010 to live in a two-bedroom apartment owned by Leroy Schecter on the 35th floor of 15 Central Park West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there are the home renovators. About four years ago, when the market was considerably softer, a family paid $30,000 a month for a year to rent a Fifth Avenue apartment while a central air-conditioning system was installed in their Park Avenue residence, Mr. Hughes said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the idea that an all-rental building could command rents exceeding $20,000 a month is relatively new in New York, brokers say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the moment, at least, the only one that seems to be trying is One MiMA Tower in Midtown, where three residences on the 63rd floor have been listed for $20,000 to $25,000 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The largest, Penthouse C-D, which was combined, has three bedrooms and four bathrooms spread over 2,200 square feet. One penthouse has already been rented since coming on the market in mid-May, but two remain, said Daria Salusbury, a senior vice president of the Related Company, the building's developer and manager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One MiMA apartments were originally built as condos before the decision was made to rent them. In addition to open West Side views of the Hudson; 44,000 square feet of amenity spaces; and fairly high-end finishes, ''you have privacy,'' Ms. Salusbury said. ''You can't see other apartments; you can't even see your own neighbors.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That isn't true at New York by Gehry, where you can stand at the window of the master bedroom of the north penthouse, renting for $60,000, and look to your left and see part of the west penthouse. You can see into the window of the apartment below that as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is the whole vertical living thing here,'' said MaryAnne Gilmartin, an executive vice president of the Forest City Ratner Companies, the building's developer (and the developer of The <span class="companylink">New York Times</span> building). ''There are a lot of social connections in the building. There are little pieces and slivers of the building where you are looking into other units.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To each his own, but to me that seems the biggest downside of the Gehry penthouses, along with interior finishes that, while supposedly designed by Mr. Gehry himself, don't seem quite up to the standard of the top-flight condo buildings Ms. Gilmartin says they are competing with.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There may be some room for improvement. Officials said they were open to allowing renters to make changes, in the kitchen and closets in particular. ''We recognize that clientele at this level might desire a different look and feel in the kitchen,'' she said, ''and we are open to those types of changes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She also said that a few celebrities and sports figures had already asked to see the penthouses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One potential bonus of renting the north penthouse: a 500-square-foot studio apartment on the same floor, which Forest City Ratner is currently thinking will be included with the $60,000-a-month rent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As I stood in the penthouse's sprawling main room, where the ceilings reach 13 feet near the undulating windows that fan out from west to east, I realized these sky-high rentals could draw a crowd for their truly spectacular views alone. The apartment seems almost level with the new World Trade Center, and you can see the Santiago Calatrava-designed Transportation Hub still under construction; the 57-story Woolworth Building is a neighbor, and the rest of Manhattan disappears over the horizon looking north from downtown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You have a perspective of Central Park'' at the 15 Central Park West building, said Bruce Ratner, the chairman and chief executive of Forest City Ratner, who took in the view with me. ''But there is no perspective I am aware of that you live in that is a perspective of New York. This is it.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHEN Reno Dakota moved to Manhattan in 1982, Brooklyn seemed as far away to him as Ohio, where he grew up. “I didn’t go above 23rd Street, and I didn’t go to the boroughs much,” Mr. Dakota said. “I mean, Brooklyn existed, and it was completely populated. But in those days, downtown was it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dakota, 53, was for many years a downtown beau idéal, living in the East Village, working as a prop stylist and decorating nightclubs like Area, even inspiring a song by the Magnetic Fields about unrequited attraction. (Sample lyric: “Reno Dakota, there’s not an iota of kindness in you/You know you enthrall me and yet you don’t call me.”)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But eight years ago, Mr. Dakota decided to buy a house with his longtime partner, Kei Yip, now 47, a sportswear designer who grew up in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, and had about as much interest in the borough as Mr. Dakota did. Priced out of their neighborhood of choice, Harlem, the couple widened their search and found an 1895 brownstone on a block of similar homes in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. They initially passed on it, because the house wasn’t near the A train, an express. “We were still thinking Manhattan was the world,” Mr. Dakota said. “And the most important thing was access to it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Months later, though, as real estate prices climbed, he called the seller back and asked if the house was still on the market. “She said: ‘Yeah. And I’ve lowered the price and stripped the woodwork in the kitchen.’ I showed Kei the pictures and called her back and said, ‘We’ll take it.’&nbsp;”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dakota and Mr. Yip were recounting the story one recent morning while sitting in their “gentlemen’s library,” as Mr. Yip called it. With its built-in bookcases, ornate wallpaper, portières and heavy wood furniture, the room (like the entire house, in fact) resembles a fusty Victorian interior preserved in amber.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was the idea, Mr. Dakota said: “We wanted it to feel like some old person had lived here for a long time and we just walked in. Which, of course, is not the case.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, the two, who bought the home for $545,000, have spent the last seven years and another $150,000 meticulously renovating it with the 19th century in mind, with Mr. Yip handling the mortgage payments and Mr. Dakota as a full-time carpenter and historical restoration expert.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although “neither of us gave a damn about Victorian before we bought this house,” Mr. Dakota said, they are now well versed in subjects like the history of gas lighting and the Turkish corner fad, and have spent countless hours scouring antiques stores for period or period-looking furniture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dakota seems to be having as much fun decorating the house as he did dressing up nightclubs back in the 1980s. A giant clown face from that stage of his life hangs from the ceiling in the entry hall. Otherwise, Mr. Dakota said, he has been “fascistic” about eschewing any non-Victorian décor. Pointing to a group of oil paintings hanging in the front parlor, he deadpanned, “This is our collection of dreary landscapes.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the floor below the artwork was an odd, slightly disturbing piece of Victoriana: a 19th-century wooden gynecological examination table, picked up at an antiques store. “We use it as our coffee table,” Mr. Yip explained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IF Mr. Dakota has an artistic medium, it’s wallpaper. In his old apartment in the East Village, which was featured in Nest, he canvased nearly every room in wallpaper, and he has done the same here, using reproduction and vintage-inspired patterns from companies like Clarence House and Bradbury &amp; Bradbury.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The overblown woodwork in a Victorian house creates a frame which cries out for a picture, which is wallpaper,” he said, being slightly overblown himself. “To ignore those cries is to live in disharmony with the space.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dakota restored the house room by room, starting on the top floor and working his way down, only recently completing the ground-floor kitchen, which has an Aga stove and a wood-slab dish drainer he made in his basement wood shop. “When we first moved here, it was kind of like camping out,” he said. “It looked like a cruddy box: no wallpaper, no plaster, all the floors were really crusty.” He has a few “adjustments” to make, he said, including finishing the master bedroom on the first floor (they rent out the top floor), but he has become so inspired that he has decided to go into business doing historical interior restoration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, he and Mr. Yip have become loyal Brooklynites, spending most of their time in the neighborhood and rarely going into Manhattan anymore. Mr. Dakota has also been campaigning to get historic district status for their section of Bedford-Stuyvesant, known as Stuyvesant East.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I’m actively involved with the community board,” he said, with disbelief. “It must have to do with owning a house. I lived in the East Village for 23 years and never heard of a community board.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON (Reuters) — Sales of new homes recorded the biggest drop in more than a year in June, and prices resumed their downward trend, dealing a setback for the budding housing market recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family home sales tumbled 8.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted 350,000-unit annual rate, the lowest rate in five months, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The percent decline was the largest since February 2011. Much of the drop in sales last month reflected a 60 percent plunge in the Northeast, a region that had enjoyed hefty gains since December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Housing will continue to recover gradually throughout the year, but fundamentals are not supportive of a fully fledged housing market recovery,” said Yelena Shulyatyeva, an economist at <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas</span> in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop in new-home sales last month came on the heels of a decline in home resales during the same period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing had appeared to be bucking weakness in the broader economy, which has experienced a sharp slowdown in job growth and a cooling in manufacturing against the backdrop of fears of tighter fiscal policy in Washington in early 2013 and a lingering debt crisis in Europe[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/european_sovereign_debt_crisis/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While sales of both new and previously owned homes fell last month, other parts of the housing markets exhibited strength.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home construction in June hit its highest level since October 2008 and confidence among home builders this month was the highest it has been in more than five years, reports showed last week. This offers cautious optimism the pullback in sales will be temporary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It is hard to believe that the market is turning downward when the home builders’ confidence index jumped in July to its highest level in over five years,” said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors. “Either developers are clueless or the data have yet to catch up with reality. I am on the side of the latter.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">May’s sales pace was revised to show 13,000 more units sold than previously reported. New-home sales were up 15.1 percent, compared with June last year.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another market indicator suggests the housing market is finally recovering[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/28/business/economy/new-indications-housing-recovery-is-under-way.html]. Home values rose slightly in the second quarter from a year ago, the first annual increase in five years, Zillow, the real estate Web site, reports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zillow's home value index [http://www.zillow.com/wikipages/What%27s-the-Zillow-Home-Value-Index/]rose 0.2 percent compared with the second quarter of 2011 (median values have been increasing on a monthly basis for four consecutive months). The median home value is now $149,300 (meaning half of homes are valued above that amount and half below) and is expected to rise another 1 percent over the coming year, said Stan Humphries, Zillow's chief economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(Zillow's report includes an interactive map[http://www.zillow.com/blog/research/2012/07/24/where-are-they-now/] showing how home values in many zip codes have changed.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Th growth is sluggish, given that inflation is running close to 2 percent and home values historically have increased from 2.5 percent to 5 percent a year, Mr. Humphries noted. Still, for potential home buyers who may have been waiting on the sidelines for the market to bottom out, the change is encouraging. "Now's the time to go home shopping," Mr. Humphries said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home buying hasn't boomed despite historically low interest rates, due to continued fear of falling prices and general economic uncertainty. For the last two years, the housing market seemed to gain steam in the first quarter, only to fall back in the second quarter. But this year, Mr. Humphries said, it seemed those fears were diminishing in buyers' minds. The numbers suggest, he said, that "there is some organic, fundamental strength in housing right now."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether that continues is uncertain. The recovery is fragile, given continued foreclosures, slow job growth and the prospect of the "fiscal cliff" of higher federal taxes and budget cuts looming at year's end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are you confident home prices have hit bottom? Are you ready to buy?</p>

</div><div class="author">By MICHELLE HIGGINS </div><div>981 words</div><div>22 July 2012</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2012 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IF living in one of the 275-square-foot ''micro-units'' outlined by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg recently as part of an apartment design competition sounds unbearable, consider this: the size of new rentals in the city has been shrinking in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While apartment units vary by neighborhood, the sweet spot for studios in new rental buildings is now ''close to 400 square feet,'' said Yuval Greenblatt, an executive vice president of Prudential Douglas Elliman, who has managed residential rentals for the past 15 years. ''Ten years ago,'' he added, ''they would build closer to 500 square feet wherever that could be achieved.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Condos haven't followed the same trajectory, with many developers building larger units to attract buyers. But rentals have been shrinking in order to keep monthly rents reasonable amid high demand, said David Sigman, an executive vice president of LCOR, an investment and development company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zoning regulations in New York City require new apartments to have at least 400 square feet -- a constraint that has acted as a barrier to new housing possibilities. Those rules will be waived for the micro-apartments project, to be designed and built by the competition winner at a city-owned site in Kips Bay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In new luxury rental buildings, space that would previously have been used for larger apartments is increasingly being devoted to shared amenities. At 34 Berry, a seven-story, 142-unit luxury rental building LCOR developed in Williamsburg, for example, more than 50 percent of the apartments are studios, ranging from 461 to 652 square feet. A shared lounge that residents can use if they start feeling claustrophobic features multiple flat-screen TVs, a catering kitchen, a billiards table and <span class="companylink">Nintendo</span> Wii.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mikael Schulz, 36, and his partner, Claudio De Menezes, 43, who share a 466-square-foot studio at 34 Berry and pay about $2,200 a month in rent, don't have a television. When they want to watch TV or use the Internet, they treat the lounge as an extension of their apartment. For entertaining friends, there is a rooftop terrace with a barbecue grill and retro-style pod seating. With all the amenities, said Mr. Schulz, a fashion photographer who recently moved to New York from Sweden, ''you basically just need a nice, calm space to sleep and a kitchen.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given that trend, many in the industry view Mayor Bloomberg's competition as a welcome challenge, and city officials hope to find a prototype for a new model of affordable, if tiny, housing. ''There are a lot of developers that would like to build units that are smaller,'' to cater to people who would like to have the opportunity to rent on their own instead of with roommates, said Andrew Gerringer, managing director of new business development for the Marketing Directors, a New York development, leasing and marketing company. ''A lot of people would like to have their own space, but they've been prevented.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Good design is key, said Evan Rosenfeld, a broker with Citi Habitats. ''The number is irrelevant. It's the layout that counts.'' If the studio is well designed and in a desirable neighborhood, he said, ''a lot of times, people will sacrifice size.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Diminutive apartments have become something of an art form in other cities, including Tokyo and Hong Kong. New apartments in Tokyo can be as tiny as 193 square feet for single people, depending on the neighborhood, according to Azby Brown, the director of the KIT Future Design Institute in Tokyo and the author of ''The Very Small Home: Japanese ideas for living well in limited space.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The famous Nakagin Capsule Tower in Tokyo, designed by Kisho Kurokawa and built in 1972, had apartments of about 107 square feet. ''These kinds of innovations are already happening'' in other cities, said Jerilyn Perine, the executive director of the nonprofit Citizens Housing and Planning Council in New York, which has been exploring new affordable housing ideas for the last three years through its Making Room project. ''Our power to innovate kind of has gotten stuck in a plethora of regulatory constraints. We need to be at the forefront of these things again.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city hopes that rent for the micro-units in the pilot program will be below the current market value of $2,000 a month. Already, in its first week, the city's request for proposals has been downloaded more than 700 times from the Web site of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate consultants caution that micro-units won't work in every market. But in places like Williamsburg, which attracts 20-somethings just out of school, or Bushwick's artist enclaves, ''these would do fabulous,'' said David J. Maundrell III, the founder of aptsandlofts.com, a New York brokerage firm that specializes in new-development marketing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, living in cramped quarters is a rite of passage for most New Yorkers. Plenty reside in apartments smaller than 400 square feet that were built before the current zoning rules went into effect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephenson Andrews, an architectural historian, lives with his partner in a 300-square-foot rent-stabilized Midtown East studio that includes a full bathroom, a compact kitchen and two closets. ''Would we like more room? Of course,'' he posted at nytimes.com/cityroom in response to an article about the micro-units contest, ''but it can and should be done. I've known too many people who have shared studio apartments in my three decades of being in NYC because they couldn't afford anything more and they would've loved their own space, however modest.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LAST fall Kathleen and Donald Hogan of Plainview, who had fallen three months behind on their mortgage payments, sent the <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> a check for $2,020. It was all they could muster of the $3,256 they owed their mortgage servicer that month on the three-bedroom two-and-a-half-bath split-level they have owned since 2001. The bank returned the check, refusing a partial payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unable to sort out their problem and restart a loan modification process by phone, the Hogans recently attended a foreclosure help event sponsored by <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> at a Marriott in Uniondale. They hoped to roll the $9,700 in arrears into a new loan, or be given 18 months rather than 90 days to pay it back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hogans were among the 4,955 delinquent customers within a 100-mile radius invited to the outreach event with housing counselors and specialists that the <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> held July 12 to 14 at the Marriott.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to a <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> spokeswoman, 291 customers met with loan-modification specialists, underwriters and other experts on site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a thorough analysis of your financial situation,'' said Jessica M. Garcia, a vice president for national mortgage outreach. ''The economic downturn has impacted people in different ways,'' among them divorce, job loss, underemployment or illness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spokeswoman said that out of the 30 percent who arrived with full documentation, only about 10 were approved for a loan modification. Customers who did not receive a decision on site have the option of meeting later with a specialist; 50 attendees scheduled appointments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> event was one of several on the Island in the wake of a $25 billion federal-state settlement reached in February with the nation's five largest loan servicers for foreclosing without verifying documents. The settlement provides relief for: homeowners needing loan modification now; borrowers who are current but underwater, or owe more than their property is worth; and victims of wrongful foreclosure conduct.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span>, which since last fall has been meeting with struggling borrowers at a ''homeownership center'' in Hauppauge, held a loan-modification event this month at a Hempstead branch. Last Tuesday and Wednesday, <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> assembled a team of more than 100 mortgage specialists and invited 40,000 customers from the area, including 6,300 within a 25-mile radius, to a ''Home Preservation Workshop'' at the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum. <span class="companylink">Ally Financial</span> held a similar event in Melville. Distressed <span class="companylink">CitiMortgage</span> clients can attend a July 31 event at the Islandia Marriott.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> event, qualifying customers had to be 60 days or more behind on their mortgages. A modification to make payments more manageable could include extending terms, reducing the rate, or suspending payments for 90 days. Reducing the mortgage amount is not the focus, said Ms. Garcia, who has been running such events in different parts of the country for four years. ''Let's right-size the payment based on what the customer can manage.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our goal is foreclosure prevention,'' she added. The bank also operates a customer-assistance center in West Hempstead six days a week. In June, according to RealtyTrac, a foreclosure listing firm, there were 391 new notifications of pending foreclosure in Nassau County and 178 in Suffolk County, down from June a year earlier, when there were 428 in Nassau and 292 in Suffolk. Foreclosures are affecting one in 1,162 homes in Nassau and one in 2,317 in Suffolk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marie Day, a regional servicing director for Wells Fargo home mortgage division, which services 17 percent of Island mortgages, says that 7 percent of its customers are currently unable to pay their mortgages on time. ''We will do all we can to get them to an affordable number,'' she said. ''We do not want to be in the real estate business'' -- rather to help ''as many of our customers as possible to stay in their home.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before seeing specialists at the <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> event, borrowers discussed budgets with housing counselors from the nonprofit agencies <span class="companylink">Community Development Corporation of Long Island</span> or the Long Island Housing Partnership, both certified by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Topics included ''crisis budgets'' for the immediate hurdles, as well as budgets maintainable in the long term. ''It's a reality check, an awareness,'' said Joan LaFemina, the program manager for homeowners services for the Community Development Corporation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The budgeting form required itemization of gym memberships, cosmetics purchases, expenses like dry cleaning and manicures -- in short, minor expenses that add up and ''prevent people from long-term success.'' The counselors functioned as a nonjudgmental ''support team'' to help prioritize budget essentials and prepare for the bank process. ''Everyone thinks a modification will save them,'' Ms. LaFemina said. ''We can't promise that everyone can keep their home. It's about being honest and realistic.'' The events, she continued, ''offer them -- for good or bad -- answers, resolutions.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carol Yopp, the foreclosure prevention program manager for the Long Island Housing Partnership, said many of the homeowners who attended had previously received a modification and were ''now out of work and facing another crisis.'' Contributing factors have included exorbitant local property taxes and a high cost of living, she added. Homeowners who are unemployed shouldn't expect a loan modification, she said, but they can request that the bank ''defer a portion of their payment while on unemployment without penalty.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the Hogans, paying the mortgage became problematic in 2008 when Mr. Hogan lost his job. Then Ms. Hogan was disabled. Two years ago, when one of their children suddenly needed surgery, their medical expenses soared; that was when they first received a loan modification.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, counting the arrears, the delinquency charges and other bank fees, their initial $300,000 mortgage swelled to $426,385, Ms. Hogan said. ''Basically the last 10 years of paying the mortgage were lost,'' she added, expressing hopes that they could ''hold on to what we have'' and not lose the house. After several hours at the event, the bank deferred a decision on the Hogans' plight for 7 to 10 days.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AS home values continue to stabilize in many areas, lenders are making home equity loans more accessible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report published in June by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency noted that one in five lenders nationwide loosened up underwriting standards on home equity loans, while another 68 percent kept them unchanged from a year ago. In 2009 -- during the heart of the housing crisis -- no lenders had eased standards, according to the report, which surveyed 87 banks with assets of $3 billion or more, while 78 percent had tightened them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders also have been lowering the credit scores and equity levels needed to qualify, industry experts say. ''You may not need to have as much equity as lenders may have demanded two years ago, when housing prices were going to fall,'' said Keith Leggett, a senior economist at the <span class="companylink">American Bankers Association</span>. This is especially true, he said, in areas where home prices are appreciating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly 90 percent of homeowners in the New York metropolitan area now have some built-up equity, versus 77 percent nationwide, according to a recent report from the data analytics firm <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Navy Federal Credit Union</span>, with over three million members nationwide and five branches in the New York region, is among those easing qualifications, based on its periodic analysis of borrowers' lending performance. ''We have gone to lower credit scores,'' said Steve Krieger, a vice president for mortgage collections and equity lending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Krieger says the credit union's evaluation of home equity applications is based on several criteria, including: the amount of equity available in a home; a borrower's income; and a loan-to-value ratio. (As little as 5 percent equity may be enough to qualify.) Someone who has been in a job for just two or three months ''will be dinged a bit,'' he noted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders calculate the loan-to-value ratio by adding the home equity loan amount to the mortgage balance and then dividing that by the property's value. Today, 80 to 90 percent would be the highest acceptable ratio, according to Jeanie Melendez, a vice president for market growth and development consulting at <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo Bank</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those considering a home equity loan should begin the process by estimating how much equity they might have available in their homes. Mr. Krieger suggested checking recent comparable sales in the neighborhood at online sites like <span class="companylink">Zillow.com</span>. ''You can get into the ballpark of what your home is worth,'' he said, though he pointed out that as part of the application process the lender generally requires an official appraisal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Borrowers must decide whether they want a traditional home equity loan, sometimes called a second mortgage, which has a fixed interest rate and fixed payments, or a home equity line of credit, known by its acronym, Heloc. A line of credit usually has a variable rate and can be drawn down incrementally. The variable-rate Heloc is one and a half percentage points lower than the fixed-rate home equity loan, which in turn is around three percentage points above the average 30-year fixed-rate conventional mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Borrowers should also note loan restrictions. For example, <span class="companylink">Navy</span> Federal does not allow home equity loans to be used for small-business investment or to buy a second home, while <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span> does not allow them to be used on educational costs. (Some loans are actually audited after closing, to check.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>, one of the nation's largest mortgage lenders, has no such restrictions. ''I don't think folks are using it to buy a fur or a big-screen TV,'' said Ms. Melendez, who is based in Boston and oversees the New York region. ''They're being more careful about how they're using their home as an asset.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Melendez says that although Wells has not made changes to its lending criteria, it has been seeing increased demand for home equity borrowing, largely to pay for home improvements and college education.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON (Reuters) — Builders began work on the most new homes in June in well over three years, providing some support to an economy that has shown worrisome signs of cooling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that housing starts rose 6.9 percent last month, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 760,000 units — the highest rate since October 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Housing is clearly in recovery mode, although the sector is much less important than it used to be,” said Jim O’Sullivan, an economist at High Frequency Economics[http://www.hifreqecon.com/Jim-OSullivan.html].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market, which collapsed during the 2007-9 recession[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/r/recession_and_depression/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], has shown signs of strength this year, although it remains hobbled by a glut of unsold homes. But since it makes up a smaller share of the economy than it did before the recession, it can provide only a limited lift to the broader recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a cautionary sign for the housing sector, new permits for building homes dropped 3.7 percent, to a 755,000 unit pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said groundbreaking for single-family homes, the largest portion of the market, rose 4.7 percent, while starts for the more volatile multifamily homes segment rose 12.8 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Wednesday, the Mortgage Bankers Association[http://www.mbaa.org/default.htm] said applications for home mortgages jumped last week on a surge in demand for refinancing as interest rates for 30-year mortgages fell to a record low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other data in recent weeks has shown a sharp increase in signed contracts for home purchases in May, as well as rising home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Housing continues to be the one sector of the U.S. economy that is outperforming expectations,” said Michael Gapen, an economist at <span class="companylink">Barclays</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts in June were above the median forecast in a Reuters poll of a 745,000-unit rate, and readings for April and May were revised higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the broader American economy has looked weaker as of late. If the recovery failed and the country tipped back into recession, housing would also suffer.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For New Yorkers who gripe about their cramped living quarters, and there are many, the real estate news announced by the city on Monday should be worthy of note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Confronted with what the city has in mind, such malcontents may feel thankful for what they have.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced a city-sponsored competition to design an apartment building full of ''micro-units'' with 275 to 300 square feet of living space. Each would include a kitchen and a bathroom, but no closet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City officials said they hoped the building would become a prototype for a new model of tiny, but affordable, housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Young people from around the country or around the world - those are our future, and they don't have a lot of money,'' Mr. Bloomberg said at a news conference, standing in front of a life-size mock-up of a shoebox-shape studio complete with pullout bed, toilet, bowl of fruit and umbrella stand, all made of paper. ''You have to change the rules along with the requirements.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are about 1.8 million one-person or two-person households in the city, but only one million studios and one-bedroom apartments, the mayor's office said. The mismatch reflects how the city's housing has failed to keep up with the shift in its demographics in recent decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bloomberg himself spent his first 10 years in New York in a studio that, according to his estimate, had 600 square feet; his rent was $120 to $140 a month. (He now resides in a 7,500-square-foot Beaux-Arts town house on East 79th Street.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city will waive zoning regulations for the project and allow units smaller than the current minimum size of 450 square feet. Among other criteria, the submissions will be judged on designs for common spaces in the building and on their success in drawing air and light into the units. Submissions are due by Sept. 14.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some New Yorkers, already squeezed into tiny spaces, might find it hard to believe that homes can actually shrink further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But interest in making small homes livable, even beautiful, has grown as more people find that tiny is often the only affordable option, said Mimi Zeiger, who has written two books about small living spaces and who recently left a 400-square-foot studio in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The influx of young workers into cities like New York over recent decades parallels a similar flood in the 1920s and 1930s, when bachelor's apartments and single-room occupancy buildings became popular, Ms. Zeiger said. But some choose small homes out of a desire to live more simply and efficiently, rather than just out of necessity, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scott McCulley, who has lived in a 338-square-foot studio on East 69th Street since 2003, insists that everything, from decorating to entertaining, is best done in a small space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His dining table doubles as a desk; his platform bed provides storage. He has forced himself to pare down his possessions. He rarely buys food in bulk, and sometimes uses his stove for extra storage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not the amount of space you have, it's how functional it is,'' Mr. McCulley said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Architects at Jordan Parnass Digital Architecture in Brooklyn, who have worked on several studio renovations, said they emphasize multifunctional spaces and furniture that can adapt to different needs. For an East Village studio that was featured in a number apartment-design blogs, the firm built a loft with a bed and a walk-in closet, with extra storage space inside wooden stair risers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firm often receives calls from people hoping to redo their tiny studios, said Darrick Borowski, the firm's creative director.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I know they're out there; I know they're struggling with this,'' Mr. Borowski said. ''But there's a higher awareness now that you don't have to suffer through it. You don't have to move to the suburbs.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the record, Mr. Borowski occupies a 750-square-foot apartment - with his two children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THERE was much for investors to worry about in the second quarter, but at least real estate was far down the list. Several reports hinted at a recovery in this long-suffering category, and that helped real estate investment trusts -- portfolios of various types of property, and traded on stock exchanges -- to outperform, along with funds that focus on them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest report of the National Association of Realtors showed a 9.6 percent increase in sales of previously owned single-family homes in the 12 months through May and a 7.9 percent rise in prices. New-home sales rose 19.8 percent over the same period, according to Census Bureau data, and prices rose 5.6 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commercial property has been on an upswing, too. The most recent reading of an industry benchmark, the CoStar Commercial Repeat Sale Value-Weighted U.S. Composite Index, was 6.5 percent higher in April than it was a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The improvement is hardly conclusive evidence that the multiyear decline in real estate prices is over, but it was enough to produce a 2.8 percent gain in the Vanguard REIT Index exchange-traded fund, by far the largest portfolio of its kind, in the three months through June, while the average real estate mutual fund in Morningstar's database was up 3.5 percent. The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index was down 3.3 percent during the period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many advisers recommend real estate investment trusts, or REITs, as well as funds that hold them. They provide income when it's hard to come by, these advisers say, as well as the prospect of growth from a market on the mend. But some worry that with profits still meager for developers and other property owners, valuations are excessive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You've got a lot of people who need income, REITs are in good financial shape, and they have a lot of opportunities to pick up buildings on the cheap,'' said Allan Flader, a financial adviser at RBC Wealth Management in Phoenix. ''On the other hand they are trading at rich prices. They're not by any stretch inexpensive by historical standards.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In real estate, idiosyncratic accounting practices limit the usefulness of conventional valuation measures like price-to-earnings ratios. The preferred measure, the ratio of price to funds from operations, was recently about 18.5 for the average REIT, Mr. Flader said, versus a long-run average of 13. REITs have also been trading at about a 12 percent premium to net value of assets, well above the 3 percent average, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors seem willing to pay up for assets that yield 3.3 percent, as an average REIT does, when 10-year Treasuries yield much less and require locking up capital for that long, and bank deposits and money-market accounts pay next to nothing. Being none of the above, neither bonds nor stocks, adds to REITs' appeal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''REITs are getting so much play in the marketplace because they're a good bond alternative,'' said Jeffrey Leventhal, a partner in Bethesda, Md., for the financial advisory firm HighTower. ''More important, they're a diversifier in a portfolio because they move with bonds instead of stocks.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Flader also appreciates that aspect of REITs -- and advocates a permanent presence for them in a stock portfolio. Five percent would be an average position, he said, but his valuation concerns and an expectation of a ''choppy'' rebound in real estate lead him to recommend a 4 percent holding now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Leventhal, who sees himself as ''very favorable on commercial real estate,'' suggests having 5 percent in REITs, double his usual allocation. He prefers actively managed mutual funds, partly since the REIT world is so diverse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each trust tends to focus on one type of property, like apartments or retail, industrial or commercial buildings, including some with high profiles, literally and metaphorically, like One Penn Plaza, in Midtown Manhattan, owned by <span class="companylink">Vornado Realty Trust</span>. Some REITs are quite specific, owning only shopping malls, say, or storage facilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This segmentation, Mr. Leventhal contends, gives knowledgeable managers an especially good chance to outperform. He likes funds including Principal Real Estate Securities, <span class="companylink">CGM Realty</span> and <span class="companylink">Fidelity Real Estate Income</span>. He also recommends the Vanguard E.T.F., although it is passively managed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Wherry, a Morningstar analyst who follows real estate funds, is agnostic about real estate prices and bases his recommendations on performance, cost and his view of management quality. His favorites include <span class="companylink">T. Rowe Price Real Estate</span>, J.P. Morgan U.S. Real Estate, Neuberger Berman Real Estate, Nuveen Real Estate Securities and <span class="companylink">Cohen &amp; Steers Realty Shares</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for many investors, in his view, the Vanguard E.T.F. provides the best route into the sector. ''It gives you the broadest possible exposure to the domestic U.S. real estate market,'' Mr. Wherry said, adding that Vanguard funds also have relatively low costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">INVESTMENT advisers caution that the narrow focus of many REITs can make them poor choices for small investors who build their own portfolios. For those who want to give it a go, Morningstar has given favorable ratings to <span class="companylink">Alexandria Real Estate Equities</span>, BioMed Realty Trust, Corporate Office Properties, DiamondRock Hospitality, Hospitality Properties and Ventas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate analysts at Citi Investment Research gave positive ratings to some of the same: Alexandria, DiamondRock and Ventas. They judged Colonial Properties, Home Properties and Post Properties worth buying in the apartment sector and <span class="companylink">Kite Realty Group</span>, Regency Centers, <span class="companylink">Retail Properties of America</span> and <span class="companylink">Weingarten Realty</span> among retailing REITs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Flader's valuation concerns do not extend to REITs that specialize in foreign property. They trade at discounts to their net asset values of about 5 percent and yield about half a percentage point more than American REITs. That makes them worthy portfolio additions, he said. He declined to name examples, citing company policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One way for domestic REITs to reach bargain valuations, of course, is for their prices to decline. Real estate bulls like Mr. Leventhal envision a second scenario. If he is right, the sector should continue to give investors one less thing to worry about.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a significant ongoing recovery in both residential and commercial,'' he said. ''It's a good idea to allocate dollars to it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: July 15, 2012, Sunday</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Rent-Stabilized Apartments, Ever More Elusive</span>
</div><div class="author">By MARC SANTORA </div><div>1826 words</div><div>8 July 2012</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2012 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN the often desperate hunt for an affordable place to live in Manhattan, the rent-stabilized apartment retains a strong hold on the imagination. It is so hard to find one that newcomers may think they have gone the way of subway tokens and Automats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even in Manhattan, nearly half of all rental apartments are rent-stabilized. And last year, lawmakers in Albany strengthened protections for tenants, raising the rent ceiling to $2,500 a month from $2,000 before an apartment can be deregulated, and the annual income limit to $200,000 from $175,000. In Manhattan, the new rules affect nearly 250,000 apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those rules mean that rent-stabilized apartments may be even more difficult to come by as people stay in them longer. What with the overall rental vacancy rate of about 1 percent in Manhattan, when one does come up for lease, prospective tenants are likely to discover themselves facing nearly the same level of scrutiny as condo or co-op buyers, agents say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The appeal of a rent-stabilized unit is obvious. Landlords of stabilized units are allowed to raise the rent by only a few percentage points, as determined by the city's Rent Guidelines Board. Tenants do not have to move out until their income tops the state limit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in Manhattan, the price gap between a rent-stabilized and a market-rate unit has never been greater, according to a study released this spring by the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even before the spike in market-rate rents over the past year, rent-stabilized rates were, on average, $1,245 a month cheaper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The competition for a $4,000 one-bedroom is now fierce,'' said Yuval Greenblatt, a vice president of Prudential Douglas Elliman. ''So you can imagine how strong competition is for something below market value.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study also found that, despite the widespread impression that stabilized apartments are meant to provide affordable housing (and they certainly keep housing prices stable for hundreds of thousands of people), many of those fortunate enough to land one in recent years have been relatively well off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whereas the median income of all renters of stabilized apartments in the Manhattan core -- defined as below 96th Street -- is $57,780, the median income of those moving in in recent years is closer to the average Manhattan income of about $100,000, said Vicki L. Been, the director of the Furman Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Some people who enjoy the benefits of rent stabilization are not low-income households,'' the report revealed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York City outside of core Manhattan, the difference is less pronounced, the study found. There, the average stabilized rent is $250 cheaper than the market rate. And the median income of stabilized tenants is $8,000 below that of market-rate ones; south of 96th Street, the income difference is much greater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finding a stabilized apartment remains a challenge. The city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development has a list of all the buildings that have at least some stabilized apartments, but it provides no data on how many of the apartments in the building are regulated and how many are market-rate. It is also not a listing service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And as for the city's major brokerages, few if any keep track of stabilized units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have people all the time who come to me and ask me to find them a rent-stabilized apartment,'' said Alexis Fleming, a broker at Citi Habitats. ''I tell them good luck. It is a needle in a haystack.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In seven years, she said, she has rented just seven stabilized apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For those fortunate enough to come upon one, that may be just the beginning of the struggle. Potential renters are likely to face stiffer competition than ever as landlords sort through well-qualified bidders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jack Freund, the executive vice president of the Rent Stabilization Association, which represents 25,000 landlords and property owners, says it is in the interest of landlords to be even more selective than market-rate landlords.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the free market, you get a tenant in, and if it turns out bad, you simply do not renew that lease,'' he said. ''As a rent-regulated landlord, the owner does not have that option.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Potential renters must be fully prepared. Not only do you need to have a check in hand to cover the application fee and deposit, but as an applicant you will also be expected to have earned an annual income of 45 to 50 times the monthly rent for the past three years. If the apartment, for example, costs $2,000 a month, an applicant, or an applicant and a roommate, need to show a salary exceeding $90,000. Landlords are also closely scrutinizing credit history, looking for a score over 700.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many young people moving to the city, salary and credit history can be a problem, so they must produce a guarantor to pay the rent if the tenant cannot. Some landlords would prefer to deal with a qualified tenant. Others like guarantors, since they add an extra level of protection. Landlords generally like guarantors to show at least 100 times the monthly rent in income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers say that in small buildings, landlords are often more interested in the type of tenant one might make and therefore more understanding if all the criteria are not met exactly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A raft of rules and regulations protects stabilized tenants, including the mandatory offer of a lease renewal, but no laws govern the application process. Although some landlords take the first qualified applicant who comes along, others take multiple applications, hoping to find the most qualified tenant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Greenblatt, the <span class="companylink">Prudential</span> broker, said that when he first moved to the Manhattan in 1993, the landscape was vastly different.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without much searching, he found a lovely studio apartment with a working fireplace at 53 Irving Place for just over $700 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, when people come to him in the hopes of finding a similar deal, he offers a harsh reality check.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The same opportunities are not available,'' he said. ''Period.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The vast majority of regulated apartments are rent-stabilized. It is much harder to find anything rent-controlled -- apartments in buildings that went up before 1947 and have been occupied continuously by a tenant (or family member, spouse or lifetime partner) since 1971. There are only about 38,000 of these units left in the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shannon Aalai, a broker at Citi Habitats who specializes in finding apartments for people relocating for work, says the first thing she has to do is educate a client about the realities of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People have this notion that they are going to find this great, cheap rent-stabilized apartment,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is understandable, she said, since many people either know someone or have heard a story about a successful search for a stabilized apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But the reality is, the really cheap stuff never even hits the market,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She should know.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Aalai found her $1,300 rent-stabilized apartment in the Gramercy area because other brokers lived in the building, knew the landlord and gave her a heads-up when an apartment became available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is the kind of story that inspires hope, providing proof that deals can be found, and envy, as the reality sinks in that not everyone has an equal opportunity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Greenblatt says that those who have only a few weeks to secure an apartment will find it nearly impossible to find a stabilized one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If your timing was right and you got here 20 years ago,'' he said, ''you could be living in a three-bedroom on Park Avenue.'' Those larger units, however, rarely turn over. And if a renter does leave, it is often in the landlord's interest to do extensive renovations -- enough to legally move the apartment out of stabilization to market rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, if a person has months to search, he said, the best bet is to focus on studios and small one-bedrooms in older tenements or brownstones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Often, when those kinds of apartments turn over, the renovation that would be required in order to charge market rate is too costly, given what the unit could command in rent, so it is kept in the stabilization system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, there is always luck, and a good broker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just ask Matt Held, 22, and his college buddy, Matthew Fox, also 22.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They both wanted to live in Manhattan, and Mr. Fox, a student at the New York University School of Law, was hoping to be close to the West Village campus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For more than a month, they pounded the pavement in frustration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was really difficult to even find a decent convertible one-bedroom apartment for less than $4,000,'' Mr. Held said. Some apartments they saw had been advertised as two-bedrooms but had no living room. Others had no real kitchen, or an impossibly cramped bathroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They seriously doubted that they would find anything.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Held was also wary of brokers, wanting to do things on his own. So when Mr. Fox contacted Ms. Fleming of Citi Habitats, he was skeptical.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When she called him on a recent Saturday morning, telling him he needed to rush down to the West Village immediately, with a check in hand, Mr. Held asked if she was sure the place was decent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''She told me, 'I will not waste your time,' '' he said. She also made it clear that he had better be the first one in the apartment that morning, since it would go fast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he arrived at the apartment on Barrow Street, he was stunned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It not only had two full bedrooms, a living room, and a kitchen with decent appliances, but it was also rent-stabilized with a monthly price of $2,800.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Fox said that when Mr. Held called him about the place, his first reaction was to wonder what was wrong with it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You don't want to find that there is no door,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there were no problems, and because Ms. Fleming had a good relationship with the landlord, the application went smoothly. The two men recently moved in, and they know how lucky they are.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We were sitting around with some friends and we would not shut up about it,'' Mr. Held said. ''Finally, they were like: 'Enough already, you got a great deal. We get it.' ''</p>
<p>STEP 1: Matt Fox, left, and Matt Held went apartment-hunting together.; STEP 2: They found a place on Barrow Street with an actual living room.; STEP 3: It also has two full bedrooms and a well-equipped kitchen.; FINALLY: Lucky them. The place is rent-stabilized: $2,800 a month. (PHOTOGRAPHS BY MICHAEL NAGLE FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) (RE8) </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the years, the property at 142 North Sixth Street in Williamsburg, Brooklyn[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/classifieds/realestate/locations/newyork/newyorkcity/brooklyn/?inline=nyt-geo], has gone through many changes. It has been a popular flea market, a condominium development with a bamboo garden, and, most recently, luxury rental apartments. Now, the 44-unit building has changed hands once again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steiner NYC closed late last month on a $38 million purchase of the building, which it intends to keep as a rental property. It is the developer’s latest residential acquisition in the borough, and part of its larger strategy to reposition its portfolio into multifamily properties in Manhattan[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/classifieds/realestate/locations/newyork/newyorkcity/manhattan/?inline=nyt-geo] and Brooklyn and out of suburban office buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, Steiner NYC has been on a buying spree. It acquired a vacant building at 815 Broadway in Bushwick that it will gut and renovate into a rental building with 40 to 60 units, and a 60-unit rental building at 204 Huntington Street in Carroll Gardens that it plans to renovate. It also plans to break ground next year on the Hub, a 720-unit rental high-rise at 333 Schermerhorn Street in Downtown Brooklyn and is in the midst of closing on its first Manhattan site, land south of 23rd Street where it will build a 100-unit luxury rental building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Residential properties are the future of this company,” said Douglas Steiner, the company’s chairman, perched on a chair in his sprawling office at Steiner Studios, the Hollywood-style movie and television lot he opened in 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Williamsburg property, known as Jardin, also includes two retail units and an underground parking garage. It had been marketed as condominiums and was about half-sold when, about six months ago, the developer rescinded the purchases and converted the property into rentals. It leased the units in just three weeks, according to David Behin, president of investment sales and capital advisory at MNS, who represented Mr. Steiner and the seller, the Read Property Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In my world, if you rent something very quickly, typically it means it is undermarket,” Mr. Behin said, adding that the units rented for roughly $53 a square foot, about 10 to 15 percent below their market value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It is a great building in a perfect location, and Doug saw an opportunity to increase the value of the asset by buffing up the rents,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Founded in 1907, Steiner NYC was originally Sudler Construction. Mr. Steiner’s father, David, 82, was Samuel Sudler’s partner for more than 40 years. In 1996, shortly after Mr. Sudler’s death, the Steiners took over the company and created the Steiner Equities Group; it later created Steiner NYC as its New York arm. In addition to development, the company also does property management, leasing and construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Originally focused on industrial real estate, in recent years the company has become a large holder of commercial office parks and retail properties. Now, Douglas Steiner hopes to shift the focus again, toward residential real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There is infinite demand for residential properties, it is just a question of price,” Mr. Steiner said. “Over the years, many families in New York have built vast fortunes by investing in residential rental properties here.” He added that office properties, on the other hand, “have a limited universe of tenants, and manufacturing is slowing and it is difficult to find large industrial sites.” The company also hopes to continue investing in retail properties, which Mr. Steiner calls “a noncommodity business where, if you do it right, you can gain a monopoly.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Stanford graduate, Mr. Steiner, 51, has worked at his family’s company off and on since high school. He splits his time between an East Village apartment and a suburban New Jersey[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/classifieds/realestate/locations/newjersey/?inline=nyt-geo] home where he lives with his three children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is perhaps best known for Steiner Studios, a 20-acre complex inside the Brooklyn Navy Yard that employs 1,300 people, where the likes of HBO’s “Girls” and the film “Mr. Popper’s Penguins” have been produced. Mr. Steiner, who enjoys driving his golf[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/great-homes-and-destinations/lifestyles/golf/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] cart around the lot and peeking into the sets, is currently overseeing the studio’s fifth expansion and hopes to enlarge the business over the next decade to 50 acres and as many as 6,000 employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is hoping to use the name recognition he has earned with Steiner Studios to sell apartments. “Just as Donald Trump gets a premium for his name, we also want to brand ourselves,” he said. The company’s only condominium project, for example, at 58 and 80 Metropolitan in Brooklyn, features the Steiner name and an article on the developer in its marketing materials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“In so many condominium developments, you never know who is behind the project, but we want people to know what Steiner stands for,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Steiner has been using proceeds from the $100 million sale in April of a 265-acre commercial building complex in Middletown, N.J., to finance the bulk of these recent purchases. “We used to be rigid about not selling any of our properties, but we have become more pragmatic,” Mr. Steiner said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many cases, Steiner NYC has been using so-called 1031 exchanges for the recent deals. In a 1031 exchange, a seller can defer paying capital gains taxes on a sale by plowing the money directly into a new real estate purchase. It is possible to continue investing proceeds from sales into new acquisitions, and in that way defer the taxes indefinitely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While 1031 exchanges can provide major tax savings, “there are several hurdles to completing these transactions, such as a tight timeline,” said Wayne B. Heicklen, a partner at the law firm Pryor Cashman, who does not represent Mr. Steiner. To complete a 1031 exchange, a seller must identify new properties within 45 days of the sale and close on the acquisitions in 180 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It was quite a puzzle. I didn’t sleep for months,” Mr. Steiner said of trying to complete the deals in time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first transaction the firm completed using a 1031 exchange was the acquisition of the land on which it is building the Hub, the rental project, near the Brooklyn Academy of Music. In this case, Steiner NYC needed to buy the Downtown Brooklyn site, where there are existing buildings and a parking lot, before the sale of the New Jersey complex closed, said Michael Utevsky, Mr. Steiner’s lawyer on the deals. So a third-party intermediary bought the site, and when the sale closed, Steiner NYC took over ownership, in what is known as a 1031 reverse exchange.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The purchases at 204 Huntington Street and 142 North Sixth Street also involved 1031 exchanges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The use of a 1031 exchange to acquire the Hub is unusual, said lawyers who structure these deals, because it is a development site. Usually, sellers use proceeds from a sale to invest in something safe, like a chain of drugstores or a rental property that produces income, Mr. Heicklen said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in this case, Mr. Utevsky said, “Doug is a developer and he is eager to add value to his investments.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Proceeds from the sale of the New Jersey property have now been used up, but Mr. Steiner said he continued to look for new residential deals. As for selling another commercial property as part of the overall strategy to reposition the portfolio, the company does not currently have any properties for sale, but Mr. Steiner said, “We will consider sales from the existing portfolio if the right opportunity comes along.”</p>

</div><div class="author">By MICHELLE HIGGINS   </div><div>621 words</div><div>3 July 2012</div><div>NYTimes.com Feed</div><div>NYTFEED</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2012. The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices and sales volume for Manhattan real estate continued to hold relatively steady in the second quarter of 2012, because of a continued decline in inventory, low interest rates and increased foreign investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sale price for the second quarter was $840,000, up 2.4 percent from the same period in 2011, according to a report from StreetEasy.com[http://streeteasy.com] that will be released on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reports from the city’s largest brokerage firms also indicated relatively flat pricing, with one showing the median dropping by 2.5 percent and the others showing an increase of 1 to 2 percent. Sales volume was higher than a year ago and had more than doubled since the number of sales dropped to fewer than 2,000 in the first quarter of 2009, according to a <span class="companylink">Corcoran Group</span> report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The stability of prices in the past few quarters has instilled confidence in a lot of people,” said James M. Gricar, general sales manager at Halstead Property. “Rates are quite low and the rental market is quite high. Conditions are good. That has led to a very stable, healthy — and for brokers, optimistic — market.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new numbers come after evidence suggesting the national housing market is finally starting to recover. Still, Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel and the author of Prudential Douglas Elliman’s report, said the national market was behind the New York market, which began to stabilize in early 2010 and was “moving sideways ever since.” He added that the city benefited more from foreign buyers than did the typical United States housing market and that Manhattan’s foreclosure rate remained low, as a result of tight co-op approval standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales were more robust at the upper and lower reaches of the market. The average condominium sale price was up, with Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead Property showing an 8 percent increase over last year to $1.81 million, buoyed by tight inventory and strong sales in the luxury market, including a $70 million sale on Central Park South.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price for co-ops sold during the second quarter, however, was slightly below the same period last year, because of a shift in market share toward entry-level apartments like studios and one-bedrooms, with the Corcoran Report showing a 5 percent drop to $640,000. It was the third consecutive quarter that the market share for entry-level studio and one-bedrooms was above 50 percent, driven by low mortgage rates and rising rents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, inventory has declined to 14,254 apartments, a 5.9 percent decrease from the same period last year, according to StreetEasy.com[http://StreetEasy.com]. If that trend continues along with rising demand, prices could move higher. The number of price cuts was down by 19.8 percent, compared with the same period last year, according to StreetEasy.com[http://StreetEasy.com].</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 3,400 listings went into contract in the quarter, a 20.7 percent increase from a year ago, according to StreetEasy.com[http://StreetEasy.com]. Brokers attributed that increase to strong demand, limited inventory, low interest rates and a continued view by foreign investors of Manhattan as a safe haven.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That enthusiasm is expected to carry forward into the early part of summer, said Dottie Herman, the chief executive of Prudential Douglas Elliman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some listings continue to move more quickly than others. The demand for new apartments does not yet mean that sellers can name any price, said Hall F. Willkie, the president of Brown Harris Stevens Residential Sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“People have to realize, yes, sales are taking place, but they’re taking place where prices are justified,” Mr. Willkie said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN Westchester[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/classifieds/realestate/locations/newyork/westchester/?inline=nyt-geo] and surrounding counties, raising chickens in the backyard has evolved into quite the rage, with homeowners touting the advantages of eggs laid by hens that dine on the finest available hormone-free feed and are allowed to range at will.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Knowing the origins of their food has grown in importance to consumers, said Ken Kleinpeter, the director of farm and facilities at the Glynwood Center, a Putnam County[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/classifieds/realestate/locations/newyork/putnam/?inline=nyt-geo] nonprofit whose goal is to help small and midsized farmers. And these days many of them like the idea of being able to live off the land, especially in distressed economic times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small-scale chicken farming has engaged people like Richard and Caryn Klein, who live in a four-bedroom stone colonial on five acres in Somers that he estimates would sell for $1.5 million, even in today’s troubled market. Although they are not planning to do so in the near future, if the Kleins were to list their house, neither their 13 chickens — among them Martha and Michelle, named after first ladies — nor their roosters, Dylan and Beast, would detract from the selling price, real estate agents say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New owners could always tear down the Kleins’ chicken coop, with its gabled windows and automatic water and food dispensing systems, and instead plant grass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is often, however, an altogether different story for neighbors who are trying, in an already tough market, to sell a house. Not everyone wants to live next door to crowing roosters and the sight of chickens running around, said Deanna Dammers, a sales agent with Prudential Douglas Elliman in Chappaqua. “That kind of scenario,” she said, “definitely culls the pool of interested buyers.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Dammers knows firsthand the frustration of living next door to a brood of clucking hens. She started out seeing the charm in the backyard chicken farm next to her house in Somers. But the crowing of the roosters at 5 a.m. each day began to wear on her nerves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“A chicken coop next door can definitely lower the value of nearby homes, especially when it infringes on a neighbor’s right to quiet enjoyment,” she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recalling clients who have turned down prospective homes because of chickens next door and the mice that coops sometimes attract, Ms. Dammers said: “Not everyone wants to spend a lot of money on a house and then have to deal with that. Although some buyers don’t seem to mind, others tell me, ‘Not on your life!’&nbsp;”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, when the coop is on the actual property for sale, said Don Mituzas, a sales agent for Prudential Douglas Elliman in Katonah and Somers, most buyers see it as part of the aura of living in the country. “It can actually add to the cachet of a house,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mituzas has a listing for an 1840s carriage house with three bedrooms and two baths on an acre in Brewster. The owners are asking $589,000, and Mr. Mituzas says the chicken coop on the property is “not really an issue one way or another.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Westchester, a patchwork of zoning regulations governs raising poultry on residential property. In general, the more densely populated towns and villages in the southern part of the county do not allow it. In Scarsdale, for example, backyard chickens are prohibited, although stables with as many as four horses are acceptable, said Elizabeth Marrinan, the village planner. New Rochelle[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/classifieds/realestate/locations/newyork/westchester/?inline=nyt-geo] considered allowing chickens early this year, but the proposal was voted down, 4 to 3, by the City Council, said Kathy Gilwit, a spokeswoman for the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yonkers does not permit chickens. Mount Vernon, east of Yonkers, considers them to be domestic animals, the same as dogs and cats. Centrally situated White Plains allows chickens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the northern communities, the issue gains in complexity, with some zoning boards allowing hens but not roosters, and others, like Pound Ridge, permitting roosters only if they are housed in sound-muffling coops. In New Castle, homeowners on 10 acres or more may raise hens and roosters, and residents on smaller lots may request a variance, said Bill J. Maskiell, the town’s building inspector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Melinda Walsh lives with her husband, William, an orthopedic surgeon, in a four-bedroom three-bath colonial on four acres in Bedford Hills, where hens but not roosters are allowed. She has been raising chickens for several years. Ms. Walsh said she had always followed the local law to the letter until one of her hens, Shevaun, “went transgender on me and started crowing.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“No one ever complained,” she recalled. “We live in a high-rent district, an expensive area where many of my neighbors raise chickens, and it’s considered quite fashionable. Besides, with many driveways a half-mile long, who’s going to know what’s going on?” In the end, though, Shevaun — who was treated with hormones, but continued to crow — was silenced by a coyote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Somers, where Ms. Dammers and the Kleins live, a maximum of six chickens is allowed; roosters are banned. Dr. Klein, who hired an architect so that the family could rely more on wind and solar power[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/solar_energy/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and less on oil and electricity, is challenging those regulations before the zoning board of appeals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They’re unconstitutional — someone telling you what you can and can’t do on your own property,” said the doctor, who specializes in internal medicine and infectious diseases in Yorktown Heights. “Why is a rooster crowing so upsetting when we have to deal with the noise of motorcycles racing up and down the street, along with weed-whackers and mowers in suburbia? The laws need to be revised.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of <span class="companylink">KB Home</span>, the Los Angeles-based home builder that caters to first-time buyers, rose the most in three years Friday after the company reported a narrower quarterly loss as it sold more houses at higher prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The net loss for the fiscal second quarter, which ended May 31, was $24.1 million, or 31 cents a share, compared with a loss of $68.5 million, or 89 cents a share, in the period a year earlier, the company said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average of 18 estimates in a Bloomberg survey was for a loss of 35 cents a share.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Revenue for the quarter climbed 11 percent, to $302.9 million. Home deliveries rose 2 percent, to 1,290 houses. The average selling price jumped 9 percent, to $233,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Record-low borrowing costs and a dwindling inventory of houses on the market have helped to strengthen new-home sales. Purchases of new houses rose in May to a two-year high, the Commerce Department said this week. Contracts to buy previously owned homes rose 5.9 percent last month, matching a two-year high reached in March, the <span class="companylink">National Association of Realtors</span> reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The overall housing market appears to have largely stabilized and is moving into a period of recovery,'' <span class="companylink">KB Home</span>'s chief executive, Jeffrey Mezger, said in a conference call on Friday. ''Dynamics have improved significantly over the past 90 days, as compared to late last year, or early this year, with declining inventory levels and heightened consumer demand.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company's shares climbed 12.64 percent, to $9.80, the biggest advance since March 2009. The stock was the best performer of the 11-member <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 1500 Homebuilding Index, which gained 4.8 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">KB Home</span> has had losses in eight of the last 10 quarters. The second-quarter loss included $9.9 million in costs tied to inventory impairments, and a $4.5 million tax benefit. The year-earlier period included $20.6 million in inventory impairments and land option contract abandonments and costs of $14.6 million related to the company's investment in a Henderson, Nev., development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders increased 3 percent from a year earlier, to 2,049 houses. Backlog, an indication of future sales, climbed 22 percent from a year earlier, to 2,962 homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While <span class="companylink">KB Home</span> is getting a boost from rising demand, customers have struggled to get financing. In March, the company made <span class="companylink">Nationstar Mortgage</span> its preferred lender.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON — Announcements of a housing recovery have become a wrongheaded rite of summer, but after several years of false hopes, evidence is accumulating that the optimists may finally be right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market is starting to recover. Prices are rising. Sales are increasing. Home builders are clearing lots and raising frames.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joe Niece, a real estate agent in the Minneapolis suburb of Eden Prairie, said he recently concluded a streak of 13 consecutive bidding wars over homes that his clients wanted to buy. Each sold above the asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I just had a home that wasn’t supposed to go on the market for two weeks sold before it even went on the market,” Mr. Niece said. “It’s definitely a lot different than what we saw” during the last few summers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like the economic recovery that began three years ago, what happens next is likely to prove a little disappointing. The pace of recovery will probably be slow, and the prices of many homes will continue to decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Millions of people remain underwater, owing more on their homes than the homes are worth, and unable to sell. Millions of families still face foreclosure[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/f/foreclosures/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier]. And a setback in the still-fragile economic recovery could easily reverse the uptick in housing prices, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But roughly six years after the housing market began its longest and deepest slide since the Great Depression[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/g/great_depression_1930s/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], a growing number of experts and people who actually put money into housing believe the end has come.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Our sense is that the market is recovering, and we’re extremely confident that it’s not going to get worse,” said Ronnie Morgan, a San Diego real estate professional who recently created a $10 million partnership to buy foreclosed homes. The group, Alegria Real Estate Funds, already has bought about 20 homes in suburban communities, most of which they plan to hold as rental properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It feels very much like we’ve hit a bottom and we’re starting to come off of that bottom,” said Stuart Miller, chief executive of Lennar, a major national home builder based in Miami. The company said Wednesday that second-quarter profits[http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=65842&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1709272&amp;highlight=] were higher than expected, and orders for new homes rose 40 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I’m a little nervous,” Mr. Miller quickly added in a conference call with analysts, “about saying the word ‘recovery.’&nbsp;”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend is clear in the data. The widely respected S.&amp;P./Case-Shiller index reported earlier this week[http://www.standardandpoors.com/servlet/BlobServer?blobheadername3=MDT-Type&amp;blobcol=urldocumentfile&amp;blobtable=SPComSecureDocument&amp;blobheadervalue2=inline%3B+filename%3Ddownload.pdf&amp;blobheadername2=Content-Disposition&amp;blobheadervalue1=application%2Fpdf&amp;blobkey=id&amp;blobheadername1=content-type&amp;blobwhere=1245335808401&amp;blobheadervalue3=abinary%3B+charset%3DUTF-8&amp;blobnocache=true] that sales prices for existing homes rose in April for the first time this year. Several other measures, including a seasonally adjusted version of the index, show that price increases began in February. The pace of housing construction has increased[http://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/pdf/newresconst.pdf]. And the National Association of Realtors[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/national_association_of_realtors/index.html?inline=nyt-org]said Wednesday[http://www.realtor.org/news-releases/2012/06/pending-home-sales-up-in-may-continue-pattern-of-strong-annual-gains] that pending home sales climbed to the highest level since the end of a federal tax credit for first-time buyers in September 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the fourth consecutive year that the housing market has shown signs of revival, and each previous episode ended with prices renewing their downward slide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with each passing year, an eventual recovery has grown more likely. Prices have continued to fall, and the economy has continued to recover, a combination that has expanded the pool of potential buyers. The population has continued to grow while few new homes have been built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Basic indicators of market health that bulged during the bubble, like the ratio of housing prices to income, have returned to more normal levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government efforts to help homeowners have intensified, allowing more borrowers to refinance or avoid foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“All bets are off if anything happens to the economy, but apart from that, I think the fundamentals look better than they’ve looked in 17 or 18 years,” said Richard K. Green, a professor of real estate at the University of Southern California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Professor Green cited the combination of rising rents and low mortgage rates as a powerful inducement to potential buyers, both renters who would prefer to own and investors who want to become landlords.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Compared to a lot of other investments right now this looks pretty good,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The influx of investors is a major reason that the market is looking stronger. Mr. Morgan, 56, built apartments before the housing crash. In 2010, seeing a new opportunity, he and some friends started bidding at the foreclosure auctions then held on the steps of the San Diego County Courthouse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first they bought properties to renovate and resell. Now they are focused on potential rental properties in the kinds of gated, planned communities in suburban San Diego that once were populated almost exclusively by people who owned their homes. Some of their tenants are former homeowners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And competition has increased. The auctions were moved from the courthouse steps last year because the crowds had grown too large.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“There’s not a whole lot of other places to put your money,” Mr. Morgan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are still reasons for caution. An unusually warm winter seems to have given a temporary and misleading boost to a range of economic indicators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pace of economic growth remains slow and fragile, shadowed by the risk that politicians in Europe and Washington will fail to address looming problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the rise in prices is happening despite the vast number of vacant houses awaiting buyers, up to two million more than the normal level, with several million more houses still at risk of being foreclosed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this “shadow inventory” is not distributed uniformly, according to a new analysis by <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>. Even within metropolitan areas like Phoenix, the vacant houses are clustered in less desirable neighborhoods, while buyers are seeking homes in areas where there are few vacancies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under these circumstances, the researchers concluded, “It is possible for us to see both house price increases and excess housing supply at the same time.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, in a growing number of areas demand for homes is outstripping supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes for sale has been falling for more than a year, according to the National Association of Realtors[http://www.realtor.org/news-releases/2012/06/existing-home-sales-constrained-by-tight-supply-in-may-prices-continue-to-gain]. Some owners are waiting for prices to rise; some of them must wait because they are underwater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Niece, the Minnesota real estate agent, said he and his partner had seen their book of listings decline from about 120 properties to 70 properties, about 45 of which already are under contract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I have buyers every single day complaining that they can’t find houses,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Driving through a neighboring suburb last week, Mr. Niece said that he passed a sign outside another real estate office that read, “The market is great. We’ve sold all of our inventory. We need listings.”</p>

</div><div class="author">By PATRICK McGEEHAN </div><div>1037 words</div><div>28 June 2012</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>23</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2012 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The retail success story in Manhattan is well known: a steadily growing influx of tourists has pushed per capita retail sales in the borough far higher than in the rest of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But retailing in the city's other four boroughs is a far different story, one in which sales at most types of stores were significantly below national averages, indicating that many New Yorkers were shopping in Manhattan or outside the city, according to an analysis conducted by Eastern Consolidated, a real estate services company in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The notable exception was in stores selling health and personal care products, a category that includes drugstores, said Barbara Byrne Denham, an economist at Eastern Consolidated who conducted the study. Drugstore chains have become ubiquitous in the city in part by offering a variety of products commonly sold in supermarkets or general-merchandise stores like Target that are less common in the city, Ms. Denham said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It means that outer-borough residents have to buy their laundry detergent at Duane Reade, where it's expensive, whereas most Americans buy their laundry detergent at a store like Target, where it's cheaper,'' she said. ''To me, that's unfortunate.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Alonzo Lawrence's neighborhood in the Mott Haven section of the South Bronx, not even a Duane Reade or a CVS store is in sight. The nearest department stores are a long subway or bus ride away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lawrence, 75, said that when he wanted to shop for clothes, he traveled across the Bronx to Parkchester or Co-op City, or all the way into Manhattan to <span class="companylink">Macy's</span> in Herald Square. Wearing a white jogging suit and a straw boater while waiting for a city bus, Mr. Lawrence said the discount-shopping options had improved in recent years with the addition of a <span class="companylink">Costco</span> store in East River Plaza in Harlem -- still an interborough subway or bus ride away -- and a <span class="companylink">BJ's Wholesale Club</span> on the far side of the Grand Concourse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite living about as far away from a chain drugstore as a New Yorker can, Mr. Lawrence said he was more satisfied with the shopping in his neighborhood than with the food choices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They could use one or two nice restaurants,'' he said, nodding toward the corner of 138th Street and Willis Avenue. That intersection did not offer a <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span>, a bank branch or a chain store of any kind. Instead, it was crowded with small shops like Jimbo's hamburgers and El Shorty Barbershop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only sign of a popular chain's moving in was at the former site of a corner bar -- across the street from the 40th Precinct police station -- which workers were transforming into a Dunkin' Donuts. That chain had more than 465 locations in the city last year, including 65 in the Bronx, according to an annual tally of chain stores conducted by the Center for an Urban Future, a public-policy research group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lawrence was not thrilled. ''I'm not a doughnut person,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the first appearance of a chain outlet could be a harbinger of a retail influx, said Jonathan Bowles, director of the center. ''Retailers first put down a presence in Manhattan, but today they see the boroughs outside of Manhattan as huge areas of untapped opportunity.'' However, he added, there are ''significant pockets of the boroughs that are under-retailed still.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bowles noted that Windsor Terrace, a fairly affluent section of Brooklyn, was about to lose its only grocery, a Key Food store, which is scheduled to close on Saturday. The next occupant of the space is expected to be a Walgreens. Local officials are appealing to Walgreens management to sell produce in the store. In the meantime, Councilman Brad Lander, who represents the district, is trying to organize car pools to help older residents get to the nearest alternative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the latest census data available, Ms. Denham said, the gap between spending habits in Manhattan and that of the other boroughs was wide. In 2007, she said, the amount of retail sales per Manhattan resident -- $23,250 -- was almost triple the national average, and had grown about twice as fast as the national average in five years. Much of that spending was attributable to tourists, who have been flooding into Manhattan in rising numbers, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the other boroughs, per capita retail sales were lower than the national average. In the Bronx, they totaled $3,362, less than half the national average. Ms. Denham estimated that by this year, the per capita sales in the Bronx were still about half the national average despite the citywide gains in retailing and retail jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The figures indicate that there is still a lot of unmet demand from shoppers in the other boroughs. Per capita sales there are significantly below the national numbers in stores that sell clothing, electronics or furniture, and even in general-merchandise stores like Target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Target has nine stores in the city, including three in Brooklyn and three in Queens, but it has not saturated the city in the way the drugstore chains have. Among them, Duane Reade, CVS, <span class="companylink">Rite Aid</span> and Walgreens had a total of 640 stores in the city last year, according to the Center for an Urban Future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Denham said the presence of grocery-delivery services like FreshDirect had made it harder for small grocery stores to survive in the city. The numbers she analyzed show that a lot of residents of Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and even Staten Island are shopping at drugstores or heading to the suburbs to load up at big-box stores like <span class="companylink">Costco</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Denham, who lives on the Upper West Side, said she often dashed from her son's soccer games on Randalls Island to the Target in Harlem to stock up on household staples.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everyone wants a Target in their neighborhood,'' she said.</p>
<p>Many neighborhoods in boroughs outside Manhattan have few retail options besides drugstores. Along a stretch of East 138th Street in the Bronx, there are no food or clothing chain stores. (PHOTOGRAPH BY FRED R. CONRAD/THE NEW YORK TIMES) </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Boston Properties[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/boston_properties/index.html?inline=nyt-org], a real estate investment trust that focuses on prime office buildings in five markets in the United States, said recently that it had abandoned efforts — at least for now — to make its first foray into the London market, many Wall Street analysts were relieved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The possibility that Boston Properties[http://www.bostonproperties.com/site/] might tamper with its winning formula had created some uneasiness in the investment world, where the governing mantra these days is “stick to what you know.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“They’ve been so clear and focused that in order for them to go into other markets, there had better be a really compelling reason,” said Ross T. Nussbaum, a senior analyst at <span class="companylink">UBS</span>. “For them to take on the risk, the investment returns have to be exceptional.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Founded in Boston in 1970 by Mortimer B. Zuckerman[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/z/mortimer_b_zuckerman/index.html?inline=nyt-per] and Edward H. Linde, Boston Properties has been a public company since 1997. Today it owns and manages 153 properties in the New York, Boston, Washington and San Francisco areas as well as in Princeton, N.J., and it also has the only office tower currently under construction in Midtown Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its portfolio includes high-profile office towers like the General Motors Building and 601 Lexington Avenue in New York (the former Citigroup Center); the Prudential Center and John Hancock Tower in Boston; and the Embarcadero Center in San Francisco. Mr. Zuckerman, 75, often boils down the company’s strategy to a single phrase: owning “A buildings in A locations.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We have, as a company, had a particular kind of strategy to concentrate in certain markets, where we thought we would do well in good times, and not do terribly in bad times,” he said last week. “Everybody does well in good times, but the buildings we have found that do the best in bad times are A buildings in A locations. It’s that simple.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, since the depths of the recession, commercial real estate prices in major markets have recovered more than twice as quickly as those in nonmajor markets, showing an increase of 37.1 percent compared with 17.5 percent, according to <span class="companylink">Moody’s</span>/RCA Commercial Property Price Indices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since Mr. Linde’s death in 2010, Mr. Zuckerman, owner of The Daily News and <span class="companylink">U.S. News &amp; World Report</span> (where he is also editor in chief), has stepped up his involvement in the real estate company, assuming Mr. Linde’s title of chief executive. Mr. Linde’s son, Douglas, with the company 15 years, is president. In contrast to Mr. Zuckerman’s media holdings, which have experienced a great deal of turnover, Boston Properties is known for its stable management team.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to praising the high-quality portfolio, analysts give the company high marks for not taking on too much debt, and for being a skilled developer, operator and longtime owner, not just a wheeler-dealer. “They have a longstanding track record of doing fairly complicated center-city development, which gives them a competitive advantage,” said Ross Smotrich, a managing director at <span class="companylink">Barclays</span> who focuses on real estate investment trusts, or REITs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Near the peak of the market, while a buying frenzy was taking hold, Boston Properties sold billions of dollars of buildings, including 5 Times Square for $1.28 billion, and 280 Park Avenue for $1.2 billion. “They’ve done a very good job of managing risk,” said Barry Vinocur, the editor of REIT Zone Publications in Novato, Calif. “They showed an ability to pull their chips off the table when others weren’t doing it.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those transactions enabled Boston Properties to take advantage of the downturn in the market and acquire trophy office towers like the General Motors Building[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/25/nyregion/25gm.html] in 2008 and the John Hancock Tower[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980DE7DC1F39F933A05751C1A9669D8B63] in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the commercial real estate market was at its lowest, on March 1, 2009, total returns for Boston Properties have outperformed SNL Financial’s United States REIT Office Index by 209 percent to 165 percent, according to SNL, a research company in Charlottesville, Va.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signaling its confidence in the future of the New York office market, Boston Properties resumed construction last year of a 39-story Midtown Manhattan office tower at Eighth Avenue and 55th Street after halting work on the project during the downturn. In May, the last beam was placed on the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Zuckerman made the decision to go ahead even though the building has only one tenant so far, the national law firm <span class="companylink">Morrison &amp; Foerster</span>, which is leasing 184,000 square feet, about 19 percent of the total. Two other law firms, <span class="companylink">Chadbourne &amp; Parke</span> and Kaye Scholer, as well as <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>, are reportedly considering taking space there, though Mr. Zuckerman would not discuss potential tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tower will be the first new office building in Midtown since 11 Times Square, on Eighth Avenue between 41st and 42nd Streets, was completed last year. That building is only about 40 percent leased, but is arguably in a more pioneering stretch of Eighth Avenue than the Boston Properties building, 250 West 55th Street, near the Hearst Tower and the Time Warner Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, analysts said the new Boston Properties building was not without risk. “It’s a great physical product,” said John W. Guinee III, a managing director at <span class="companylink">Stifel Nicolaus</span>. “But it’s a secondary location in Manhattan. The market is very thin at over $100 a square foot, particularly if you’re not on Park Avenue or in the Plaza district.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, the building is being marketed primarily to law firms at a time when that business is contracting. At a recent conference call with analysts, company officials acknowledged that law practices today need less space than they used to. But Robert E. Selsam, the senior vice president who manages Boston Properties’ New York office, said, “I have seen no movement away from private window offices for attorneys.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A rival New York office landlord, Scott Rechler, chief executive of the privately held RXR Realty, said that the new building will not be ready for tenants until 2014, when demand for space is expected to rise. “The timing is going to work out for them,” Mr. Rechler said. “They can afford to be patient and bring in the right tenants at the right rents.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite its blue-chip reputation, Boston Properties has not entirely escaped criticism. Analysts raised eyebrows when the company, like many other REITs, sold additional shares in 2009 to shore up its balance sheet, in that way diluting the value of the existing shares. Additionally, Michael Knott, a senior analyst at Green Street Advisors, a research company in Newport Beach, Calif., said the company should have moved aggressively to acquire buildings in the hot San Francisco area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“One could say we should have a larger portfolio in all the markets we are in,” Mr. Zuckerman said in response.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Vinocur points out that Boston Properties’ decision in 1998 to make its first investment in San Francisco by buying the Embarcadero Center, an office and retail complex in the financial district, drew the same kind of complaints more recently leveled at the company for dipping its toe in the London market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, analysts are a little more willing to give the company the benefit of the doubt. Though officials have said they looked at several properties in London, it was widely reported that they had considered buying Drapers Gardens, a 292,500-square-foot building in the financial district. “Had they consummated that deal,” Mr. Knott said, “we would have been skeptical, but we wouldn’t have changed our perception of their entire body of work.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Zuckerman made it clear that he had not ruled out investing in London at some point. “We’re going to continue to look,” he said. “The London market has a lot of characteristics that we do like.”</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Spain Officials Hailed Banks As Crisis Built</span>
</div><div class="author">By LANDON THOMAS Jr.; Raphael Minder contributed reporting. </div><div>1944 words</div><div>27 June 2012</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2012 The New York Times Company.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Spain edged closer to a real estate and banking crisis that led to its recent bank bailout, Spanish financial leaders in influential positions mostly played down concerns that something might go terribly wrong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The optimism of Spanish central bankers who went on to top jobs at the <span class="companylink">International Monetary Fund</span> echoes the attitudes of officials in the United States who misjudged the force of a housing collapse several years ago that crippled banks and the economy. And it underscores the complications that can arise when government officials take watchdog roles at international agencies that pass judgment on the policies they once directed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spain's travails have now become central to the festering financial problems in Europe. The country's biggest mortgage lender has failed, and European leaders are scrambling to prevent the Continent's crisis from spreading further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The I.M.F. should be saying unpleasant things to countries to get them to reform,'' said Jonathan Tepper of Variant Perception, a London-based research firm that in 2009 published one of the first reports to warn that Spanish banks were in serious trouble. ''They have been quite late in Spain.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From their lofty perches, first at Spain's central bank and then as the I.M.F.'s top executives assessing global banking risk, Jose Vinals and Jaime Caruana were well positioned to sound alarms about the looming bank debacle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But at a news conference in Washington in April 2010, when analysts were raising red flags about failing Spanish real estate loans, Mr. Vinals -- who a year earlier had succeeded Mr. Caruana -- offered assurances. The Spanish system was ''fundamentally sound,'' he said, and its needs for cash ''very small.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year later, as the banking crisis showed little sign of improving, Mr. Vinals again called for calm, saying the market panic that had led to bailouts in Ireland and Portugal would not infect Spain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now that the recent failure of Bankia, the big mortgage lender, has prompted a 100 billion euro (about $125 billion) European rescue, it is clear that Mr. Vinals's forecasts were too sanguine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Caruana was no more prescient. Pressed at an I.M.F. news conference in July 2008 about falling house prices in Spain, he acknowledged there might be loan losses. But he said, ''The financial system in Spain is able to cope with that and is properly capitalized.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not that the I.M.F. was not paying attention. Under Mr. Caruana and then Mr. Vinals, the organization's economists produced thousands of pages of analysis that, in real time, chronicled Spain's unspooling bank crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The I.M.F. says that it is not a regulator and that its economists and officials warned early and often on the need for Spain and Europe to address its banking problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In assessing financial risks worldwide, Mr. Vinals highlighted challenges faced by savings banks, or cajas, and he backed the efforts of his former colleagues at the Bank of Spain to bring order to the sector -- such as the merger of seven cajas to form Bankia in 2010 -- although he often urged them to move faster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Certainly, Spanish officials were slow to acknowledge the depths of the problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In early May, Rodrigo Rato, then the executive chairman of Bankia, told journalists that the bank was in a situation of ''great robustness, both in terms of solvency and liquidity.'' Even after the bank's bailout a few days later, Spain's economy minister predicted that no more than 15 billion euros of public funds would be required to clean up the banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Caruana and Mr. Vinals, who declined to comment for this article, were not the only government officials to make the transition from Madrid to the I.M.F.'s headquarters in Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most prominent by far was Mr. Rato, now better known for his disastrous two-year run at the helm of Bankia. In 2004, he was picked to lead the I.M.F. after winning global recognition during an eight-year run supervising Spain's growth burst as the country's economy minister.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until he left the fund three years later, Mr. Rato was better known for praising Spain's economic miracle -- one that relied largely on revenue driven by real estate to drive growth and balance budgets -- than questioning its sustainability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He considered himself the intellectual father of that miracle, as he made clear in a 2004 speech, citing his reforms as marking ''a new era in economic policy'' for Spain. Mr. Rato, too, declined to be interviewed for this article.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were many others, of course, who did not foresee the Spanish banking blowup. Topping the list is Europe's main bank overseer, the <span class="companylink">European Banking Authority</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December 2011, the authority concluded that Spain's two strongest institutions -- Santander and <span class="companylink">BBVA</span> -- would need to raise more money than the 1.3 billion euros that was required of Bankia, which would need to be rescued just six months later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And as the United States financial crisis made clear in 2008, it is no easy task to anticipate the point at which a decline in housing prices will ignite a financial collapse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Spain, the increase in house prices between 2000 and 2007 was particularly extreme -- so much so that as early as 2006, a team of inspectors within the Bank of Spain sent a cautionary report to the government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study criticized the ''passive attitude'' of Mr. Caruana, who led the central bank from 2000 to 2006, and the extraordinary acceleration of loans to homebuyers and real estate developers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inspectors also warned of Spanish banks engaging in unusually heavy short-term borrowing at levels far beyond their deposits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2006 report painted a much darker picture than Mr. Rato and the I.M.F. saw a short time later when the fund made its own assessment in 2007 of Spain's economic and financial health -- and the Bank of Spain's ability to rein in excesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The analysis praised the ''dynamism of Spain's financial system,'' and said that ''its strong, prudential supervision and regulation remain a forte of the economy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Annual I.M.F. reviews conducted by the European department did become more critical, highlighting on numerous occasions Spain's overreliance on real estate for its growth and warning frequently that the lax lending practices of the cajas needed to be revamped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although it was Mr. Vinals's financial risk department that produced the most recent stress test on the banks, fund officials said that he recused himself from its preparation given his past ties to Spain's central bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The I.M.F. has consistently and clearly flagged the dangers that exist in Europe and the urgent need to recapitalize banks,'' said William Murray, a spokesman for the I.M.F. ''Anyone who claims the contrary is either misrepresenting the public record or just does not understand how the fund works.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People who know Mr. Vinals, a Harvard-trained economist, describe him as smooth and politically skilled -- his name emerged recently as a potential candidate to run Spain's central bank -- who during his stint as deputy governor at the Bank of Spain oversaw its international operations. .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A cautious technocrat by nature, Mr. Vinals and his colleagues are to some extent constrained in how much change they can demand from a government -- especially in the sensitive area of bank supervision -- before the country in question seeks a loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts say that former Bank of Spain officials at the fund should have made more aggressive use of its bully pulpit in light of their broad familiarity with the Spanish banking system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bruegel, a Brussels-based research organization, recently conducted an audit of the I.M.F.'s track record in assessing euro area risks before and after the crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bruegel's conclusion on Spain is that in the early going the fund was too slow to warn that tax revenue stemming from the real estate boom, and the budget surpluses they produced for Madrid, were illusory. Nor was it ever contemplated that one of Europe's largest economies would experience a capital flight crisis similar to that in Mexico or Thailand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You did not see the sense of alarm,'' said Jean Pisani-Ferry, the lead author of the report, which also said the I.M.F. oversight later improved significantly. ''There was a sense that Europe was different.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts say that Mr. Vinals and Mr. Caruana may not have warned earlier on Spain because of the trust they and others in the international financial community had in the Spanish central bank's ability to restructure the cajas without having to resort to a bailout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is fair to say that the I.M.F. may have thought that the Bank of Spain was going to take care of it,'' said Luis Garicano, an economist at the London School of Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, up through the 2008 global financial crisis, Bank of Spain officials had become the toast of the international regulatory circuit for their innovations. Most notable of those was a so-called dynamic provisioning policy, a set of rules that forces banks to set aside extra cash during good economic times to protect against the inevitable rainy days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a time, Spanish financial institutions were hailed as paragons of responsible banking -- having set aside over 110 billion euros in reserves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Jose Garcia Montalvo, a real estate specialist based in Barcelona, says that this figure could have been higher -- and the banks better prepared for the housing collapse when it came.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reserves proved insufficient, he said, because the Spanish central bank in 2004, led then by Mr. Caruana, succumbed to bank lobbying and pressure from Europe by halving the amount that banks had to set aside to 15 percent of overall loans, from 30 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From that point, Spanish bank lending, already growing at 14 percent annually, went into overdrive -- up 27 percent in 2005 and an additional 25 percent in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Caruana's career has since thrived. After just three years at the I.M.F., he left in 2009 for one of the plum global finance jobs: chief executive of the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel-based regulatory body that serves as a forum for the world's central banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last weekend, in a speech that explored the roots of the financial crisis, Mr. Caruana highlighted the economic distortions caused by frantic real estate lending, and he called for banks to be quicker to recognize losses and raise capital -- although he did not mention Spain by name.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for Mr. Rato, he left the fund abruptly in 2007, worked as a senior investment banker for Lazard in Spain and took charge of the entity that would become Bankia in 2010 -- before being forced out last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Vinals continues to supervise global banking and financial risk at the I.M.F.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IMAGINE that you are watching an outdoor theater production while sitting on the grass. You have difficulty seeing, so you prop yourself up on your knees. Soon everyone behind you does the same. Eventually, most people are kneeling or standing, yet they are less comfortable than they were before and have no better view. Everyone should sit down, and everyone knows it, but no one does.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a collective action problem, a phenomenon that is, unfortunately, all too common. At the moment, the trouble in our real estate markets and the drag these markets are placing on our entire economy may be understood as a collective action problem. In a nutshell, mortgage lenders need to write down the amounts owed by individual homeowners -- that is, let everyone sit down and relax -- but the different stakeholders have been unable to reach an agreement, even if it is in their common interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 1971 book ''The Logic of Collective Action: Public Goods and the Theory of Groups,'' the economist Mancur Olson argued that collective action problems are pervasive, plaguing nations and economic groups alike. ''Most groups cannot provide themselves with optimal amounts of a collective good,'' he said, because they cannot manage a ''selective incentive'' or arrange ''coercion or some reward.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the current real estate market, the relevant group is enormous and complex. It includes those who own first and second mortgages or home equity lines of credit or residential mortgage-backed securities or the various tranches of mortgage collateralized debt obligations or shares in banks and finance companies that in turn own mortgages. These people live all over the world and have no way of communicating with each other, let alone coming to an agreement to give homeowners a break.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My colleague Karl Case and I showed in 1996 that when the value of a home falls below the value of the mortgage debt -- when it is underwater -- a person is much more likely to default on the mortgage. And it is well known that in foreclosures, lenders lose so much on the legal costs and depressed market values of the homes that it would be in their interest to lower mortgage balances so the homeowners stay in place and don't default.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If such mortgage principal reductions could be applied on a large scale, there could be large neighborhood effects, raising a sense of optimism among homeowners and bolstering the value of all homes and, ultimately, the whole economy. But mortgage lenders in all their different forms lack a group strategy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Geanakoplos, a Yale economist, and Susan P. Koniak, a <span class="companylink">Boston University</span> law professor, have proposed legislation that gives community-based, government-appointed trustees a central role. The trustees would have the authority to impose a write-down of mortgage principal that served the interests of mortgage issuers as a group, without having to prove that each and every one would be better off. But Congress has not acted on their idea. And so we are still lacking the authority to make everyone sit down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ROBERT C. HOCKETT, a Cornell University law professor, has outlined another approach, which uses the principle of eminent domain, to solve this collective action problem. Eminent domain has been part of Western legal tradition for centuries. The principle allows governments to seize property, with fair compensation to owners, when a case can be made that such seizure serves the public interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traditionally, we think of eminent domain law as applying to land and buildings. For example, a government can use eminent domain to seize real estate along a proposed new highway route so the highway can be built in a nice straight line. It would be absurd to expect the government to bargain with each property owner to buy a strip of land along the proposed highway route and to have to redirect the highway around a farm whose owner refused to sell. That is common sense.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But eminent domain law needn't be restricted to real estate. It could be applied to mortgages as well. Governments could seize underwater mortgages, paying investors fair market value for them. This is common sense too. The true fair market value for these mortgages is arguably far below their face value, given the likelihood of default, with its attendant costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Professor Hockett argues that a government, whether federal, state or local, can start doing just this right now, using large databases of information about mortgage pools and homeowner credit scores. After a market analysis, it seizes the mortgages. Then it can pay them off at fair value, or a little over that, with money from new investors, issuing new mortgages with smaller balances to the homeowners. Taxpayers are not involved, and no government deficit is incurred. Since homeowners are no longer underwater and have good credit, they are unlikely to default, so the new investors can expect to be repaid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The original mortgage holders, the investors in the new mortgages, the homeowners and the nation as a whole will generally be better off. There will surely be some who may not agree, like the holdout farmer opposing the highway, but eminent domain ought to be able to push ahead anyway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">San Bernardino County in California is working with a private company, Mortgage Resolution Partners, on the possibility of putting such a plan into action. We must hope this effort succeeds. If it works, it can be replicated all over the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But first we have to realize that much of our economic suffering takes the form of a collective action problem. We have to stop the wishful thinking that the problem will solve itself through a spontaneous rally in home prices. We need to summon our resources to exercise the authority that allows collective action.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Professor Koniak says the solution to this problem has been so slow in coming for a simple reason: ''It's the will that's lacking! The will!''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FINANCE AND THE GOOD SOCIETY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Robert J. Shiller</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">288 pp. Princeton University Press. $24.95.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert J. Shiller made his name in 2000 with ''Irrational Exuberance,'' a book that drew on behavioral economics to explain why financial markets overshoot. Shiller concentrated on the boom-bust cycle in technology stocks, but a later edition published while real estate was taking off correctly anticipated the popping of that bubble, too. With his latest volume, ''Finance and the Good Society,'' Shiller is coming at us from the opposite direction. Quoting Walt Whitman, who found ''the eternal meanings'' in muscular commerce, he celebrates finance's ''genuine beauty'' and exhorts idealistic young students to pursue careers in derivatives, insurance and related fields.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shiller's main line of argument is an extension of Kenneth Arrow's classic 1964 article, ''The Role of Securities in the Optimal Allocation of Risk Bearing,'' which emphasized the importance of markets for protecting against risk. If firms and individuals cannot insure themselves against bad outcomes, they will be necessarily cautious; the economy will grow more slowly than it should. A company will not invest in a new factory if it cannot hedge against swings in exchange rates that might render its investment unprofitable. An individual will not consume to the full extent of his capacity if he cannot insure his house or health. By connecting the ranks of insurance seekers with specialists who pool risk and so reduce it, finance liberates animal spirits and boosts prosperity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shiller's book is a lament that nearly 50 years after Arrow's article, many forms of risk remain hard to buy and sell. This is most obviously true in poor countries. The tragedy of the Haitian earthquake of 2010 was that so few buildings were insured there. This meant not only that homeowners faced financial ruin; it meant that far more people died, since the absence of insurance deprived Haiti of an industry with an incentive to police compliance with building codes. As a result, at least 50,000 Haitians perished, whereas an earthquake of comparable force in Northridge, Calif., in 1994 resulted in just 33 deaths. However loudly critics yell that the financial sector is bloated, the world needs more insurers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rich countries may not lack standard insurance, Shiller says, but other markets for risk remain underdeveloped. For example, ordinary families have no easy way to protect themselves from the risk posed by sharp moves in house prices. If convenient markets in house-price futures existed, a young couple expecting to need a bigger home with the arrival of children could hedge the risk that house prices in their area might climb into the stratosphere. An older couple expecting to downsize as kids head off to college could hedge the risk that their nest egg might lose value. If the first family could buy a house-price future from the second, both would have their risk reduced. Such is the magic of financial markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newfangled mortgages have earned a bad name, but Shiller would like to make them even more complex. The standard home loan obliges the borrower to pay back a fixed amount, and obstinately ignores the truth that if the economy or real estate market tanks, the borrower won't do so. Far better, Shiller says, to equip mortgages with ''preplanned workouts,'' so that the amount to be paid back automatically declines if the economy collapses. Preplanned workouts would avoid the absurdity of a family buying a $300,000 home, defaulting on its $275,000 mortgage when the home's value falls to $250,000 and eventually buying an equivalent home at the new price and with a smaller mortgage. Vast amounts of transaction costs, uncertainty and suffering could have been prevented if the mortgage had been reduced pre-emptively and the family had stayed in its original home. Indeed, Shiller goes so far as to suggest that flexible mortgages might have averted the 2007-9 crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The same sort of innovation might also work for government finance. Rather than raising capital by issuing fixed-value bonds and then defaulting if times get tough, governments could issue shares in their economies. Each share might represent, say, one-trillionth of a country's G.D.P.; these ''trills'' would pay dividends whose value would depend on the performance of the economy. If the Greek government had raised money in this form, its financial obligations would have fallen with the onset of its troubles -- which might have headed off a full-blown crisis. Just as with mortgages, intelligent contracts could improve risk sharing between providers and users of capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shiller applies similar thinking to other policy challenges. Like mortgages and sovereign debt, government pension promises are specified as fixed entitlements. But the needs of the elderly must be balanced against the ability of younger generations to foot the bill; so Shiller suggests that pensions could be indexed to some indicator of taxpayer ability to pay, G.D.P. being one obvious metric. What is more, the world faces a rising challenge of inequality. Why not agree, in advance, what level of inequality a society is prepared to tolerate, and then devise variable tax rates that will deliver that target?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big point is that despite the popular revulsion at Wall Street, society needs more financial innovation, not less. But what is holding innovation back? Here Shiller offers two answers. New financial instruments are attractive only if they can be bought and sold easily; they have to be widely adopted before people will want to adopt them widely. Shiller would like to solve this chicken-and-egg problem with government-supported tax incentives for market makers who kick-start trading in new instruments. One gulps at the prospect of yet another subsidy for too-big-to-fail banks. But Shiller's proposal is logical.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second reason for the shortfall in financial experimentation is that society has grown suspicious of it. New smartphone apps are celebrated in the popular culture; new derivatives for hedging risk are reviled as tricks to enrich hucksters. Shiller devotes a large part of his book to the assertion that this prejudice against finance is wrong. Psychologists have established that the key to happiness lies not in riches but in social esteem; therefore, Shiller says, financiers face powerful emotional incentives to balance profit seeking with a social conscience. ''The futility of conquest in business mirrors the futility of conquest in war,'' he writes. Just as it is impossible to extract much wealth from conquered countries, so it is impossible to extract much happiness from wealth earned unscrupulously.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some readers may suspect that Shiller, a Yale professor, underestimates the materialism of Manhattan and Greenwich. Others may be frustrated by his meandering style. Reading his book is like wandering through an interesting garden. We learn that Israel and Brazil have more lawyers per person than the United States. We are urged to believe that Washington lobbyists ''are probably more public-spirited than most'' people. We read chapters on the history of business schools and the theory of public goods that do little to advance the main argument. But the best passages in this book make a persuasive case for a fresh view of an industry that is too glibly demonized. The most promising way to promote the good society, Shiller says, is not to restrain finance but to /release it.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Major stock indexes fell to their lowest levels of the week on Thursday, driven down by worries about global economic growth, troubled banks and falling oil prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A stream of economic data presented a bleak picture globally on Thursday. Manufacturing activity in China, the world’s second-largest economy after the United States’, shrank, while euro zone business activity retreated for a fifth month, the latest data showed. In the United States, other reports showed a decline in existing home sales in May and a rise in first-time jobless claims that was worse than forecast, while regional factory activity contracted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The home sales market is still on the mend,” said Patrick Newport, a United States economist for IHS Global Insight, in a research commentary. “But the path to recovery will be a slow and bumpy one. The key obstacle to a strong recovery right now is tight credit.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier in the week, traders bid up stocks in hopes that a <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> announcement scheduled for Wednesday would include a measure to stimulate the economy. But the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> decision to extend its asset purchase program by buying about $267 billion in longer-term Treasury securities[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/t/treasury_department/treasury_securities/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] led analysts to question how much the program, which is intended to drive down long-term interest rates, would help economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The market was really looking for more dollars than what they got,” Keith B. Hembre, the chief economist and chief investment strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, said. “And the markets are reacting to more dollar scarcity than anything.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A note on Thursday from <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> market strategists recommended a short position in the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor’s</span> 500-stock index after the Fed announcement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“And we now think, with incremental U.S. monetary policy on hold, the market will need to confront a deteriorating growth picture near term,” it said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As global economic data suggested a slowdown in crucial industries, commodity prices fell. Brent crude oil dipped below $90 a barrel, the first time it has done so since December 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Dow Jones</span> industrial average fell 250.82 points, or 1.96 percent, to close at 12,573.57, its lowest level since June 1. The S.&amp; P. 500 was down 30.18 points, or 2.23 percent, at 1,325.51, its lowest level this week. The Nasdaq composite index fell 71.36 points, or 2.44 percent, to 2,859.09.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The economic data coming out of China and Europe are not very good,” Brian M. Youngberg, an energy analyst for Edward Jones, said. “You throw in the unemployment figures here not improving much. It is just raising concern the global economy is slowing down more than otherwise thought.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That is just crushing oil prices and energy stocks,” he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Energy and materials stocks led the losses in the broader equities market, falling 4 percent and 3.3 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Considering the ample stocks, particularly in the United States, the markets were less concerned about supply constraints than they were about weak demand. Brent crude prices, which Mr. Youngberg said were a good gauge for the market’s outlook for the global economy, reflected the current thinking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Right now the sentiment has definitely gotten more pessimistic,” Mr. Youngberg said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financial companies were not spared. In Europe, an audit of Spanish banks showing that they would require more capital added to the bleak picture for the euro zone. During trading hours, expectations loomed that Moody’s Investors Service would announce credit ratings downgrades on 15 major banks. The S.&amp; P. index that tracks financial stocks declined 2.3 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initial jobless claims were 387,000 in the week ending June 16, higher than forecasts and the 386,000 in the previous weekly count. Existing-home sales fell 1.5 percent in May. An index of factory activity reported by the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank</span> in Philadelphia showed a deepening contraction in June, to a reading of minus 16.6 from minus 5.8 in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hembre said the macroeconomic picture was not the primary source of market weakness, but it added to the deterioration after the Fed meeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It is primarily a function of the run-up of the market into the Fed meeting yesterday, and the minimalist response on the part of the Fed,” Mr. Hembre said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You had the expectations of support, and they were timid, modest and disappointing,” he said. “Then you get these economic numbers that just blew out to the downside.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest rates were lower as the uncertainty in other markets drove investors into the safety of fixed-income securities. The Treasury’s benchmark 10-year note rose 9/32, to 101 6/32, and the yield fell to 1.62 percent from 1.65 percent late Wednesday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON (AP) — Builders started work on more single-family homes in May and requested the most permits to build homes and apartments in three and a half years, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase suggests the housing market is slowly recovering even as other areas of the economy have weakened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agency said that builders broke ground on 3.2 percent more single-family homes in May than in April, the third straight monthly increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, housing starts fell 4.8 percent last month from April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 708,000. But that was caused by a 21.3 percent decline in apartment construction, which can be volatile from month to month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government also said April was better for housing starts than first thought. The government revised the April starts to 744,000, from the 717,000 initially reported, and the fastest increase since October 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And builders are more optimistic about the next 12 months. They requested more permits to build homes. Permits increased to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 780,000 — the most since September 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with the gains, construction and permits requested remain roughly half the pace considered healthy. Yet the increases add to other signs that the home market may finally be starting to recover nearly five years after the housing bubble burst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builder confidence has increased since last fall, in part because more people are expressing interest in buying a home. Cheaper mortgages and lower home prices in many markets have made buying more attractive. Many economists say housing construction could contribute to overall economic growth this year for the first time since 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We continue to expect housing activity to increase gradually in coming months,” said Peter Newland, an economist at <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By region of the country, housing starts rose 14.4 percent in the West, but dropped in other parts of the country. The declines primarily reflected the weakness in apartment activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the pace of home sales remains well below healthy levels. Economists say it could be years before the market is fully healed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many people are still having difficulty qualifying for home loans or cannot afford larger down payments required by banks. Some would-be buyers are holding off because they fear that prices will keep falling.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHONES in the offices of Morris Habitat for Humanity have been ringing off the hook lately as town officials throughout Morris County have been seeking its help in spending money. The same has been true for other nonprofit housing groups in New Jersey, as local governments scramble to use up affordable-housing funds before they are forfeited to the state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Knowing they're going to lose the money, towns are calling us up and saying: 'We've got money we need to put toward affordable housing. How can you help?' '' said Blair Schleicher Bravo, the executive director of Morris Habitat for Humanity. She has recently been contacted by 10 of the county's 39 municipalities, including the town of Randolph, which granted the organization $1.3 million to build 25 affordable homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one month's time, 221 municipalities throughout the state face losing hundreds to millions of dollars each, if the money has not yet been spent on affordable-housing projects within their borders. They are up against a deadline set in 2008, when the latest phase of the Fair Housing Act went into effect, giving local governments four years to spend the funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of June 5, a total of $161.3 million had yet to be spent at the local level, according to the <span class="companylink">New Jersey Department of Community Affairs</span>, the group that has been overseeing the state's affordable-housing program in lieu of the Council on Affordable Housing -- which since last year has been an abolition target of Gov. Chris Christie. (His effort was thwarted by an appeals court in March, and this month the State Supreme Court refused to hear the appealed case, though other court challenges are still pending.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The money must either be spent or committed by July 17. But housing advocates say the affordable-housing program has been in such disarray in recent years that it has been difficult to determine what projects qualify and what constitutes a commitment. According to them, the rules were never spelled out, and the housing council, with its uncertain status, was neither reviewing nor approving projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's as if the governor's office set them up to fail,'' said Staci Berger, the director of policy and advocacy for the Housing and Community Development Network of New Jersey, a coalition of housing advocates. ''They never set the definitions, then they said, 'You never spent the money.' And now they're saying, 'We're going to take the money.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only recently, as the deadline looms, have proposals been getting approved by the Department of Community Affairs -- but with language that indicates decisions may not be final, said Adam M. Gordon, a staff attorney with the Fair Share Housing Center in Cherry Hill. Such uncertainty has made some towns hesitant to sign on to projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Towns don't know what their obligation is,'' said Michael Cerra, an analyst for the <span class="companylink">New Jersey State League of Municipalities</span>. ''So if they make a significant commitment of money without knowing if this is going to meet their obligation, they're taking a risk.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Legislation is currently being considered to extend the deadline by two years. Unless it passes, however, the state will make good on the seizure plan, and the money will be deposited in the New Jersey Affordable Housing Trust Fund, to be ''allocated pursuant to the law,'' according to a written statement from a representative for the Department of Community Affairs. Skeptics say that the state programs these funds are destined for are already budgeted, and that this money will be used to help balance the state budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is possibly the most blatant move by the state to wrest control, and money, from municipalities,'' said Francis Womack III, the mayor of North Brunswick. ''Anything the state can get their hands on, they will.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Affordable housing has been a battleground in New Jersey since 1975, when the State Supreme Court found local zoning patterns unconstitutional and obligated towns to increase their quotas of such housing. Commonly referred to as the Mount Laurel decision, the ruling generated a program that has over the years sought to overcome impediments to this goal, establishing the housing council as the enforcement agency, and creating a way for towns to raise money for new housing through the collection of fees from local builders. Those funds are the ones that the state -- now facing budget challenges of its own -- is threatening to seize, citing the four-year deadline established in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In early June, North Brunswick still had $7.8 million to spend, according to the state. Mayor Womack says the town is contributing $5.25 million to the $10.25 million purchase of a 183-unit apartment complex that has been wracked with crime and mismanagement. A private development company paid the balance, and will provide an additional $16 million to renovate the apartments, which, under an agreement with the town, will be deed-restricted as affordable housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Princeton Borough recently bought three foreclosed or vacant homes and deeded them to Princeton Community Housing to turn into affordable-housing units. Hamilton Township has signed on with HomeFront, a social services agency that develops and manages low-income housing projects throughout Mercer County, to add 12 affordable-housing units to an ongoing project there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We went knocking on doors of towns telling them, 'Come see us, we'll spend your money,' '' said Celia Bernstein, Homefront's chief financial officer. ''And luckily, that kind of worked.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With $11.7 million, Marlboro in Monmouth County has the largest quantity of unspent money. Noting that it ''is not anti-affordable housing,'' Mayor Jon Hornik said an acceptable plan had been submitted to the state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''By July 17,'' he said, ''we'll have all our trust funds allocated, plus we're contemplating a lawsuit against the state because we view it as an unfair taking.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FORT HOOD, Tex. -- The hotel here could be any Holiday Inn Express, with a green and blue sign out front, a cheery lobby and a hot breakfast bar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But nearly all the guests on a recent afternoon wore camouflage fatigues and tan combat boots. A poster near the lobby with photos of the base's commanding officers greeted guests at what had once been a 1960s-era barracks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Fort Hood hotel, what is commonplace in the civilian world is new and innovative. Its 274 rooms have been gutted and outfitted with flat-screen TVs and marble countertops. There is a free DVD library and a new outdoor pool with landscaping and deck furniture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the last three years, the Army has started taking most of its 17,000 hotel rooms private, letting large companies build, renovate and operate them as a way to save money and modernize the facilities. About 4,400 rooms have been remade through a program called Privatization of Army Lodging, or PAL; the remainder should be done in the next 10 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This allows the Army to focus on the mission,'' said Rhonda Hayes, an official in the office of Katherine Hammack, the assistant secretary of the Army for installations, energy and environment. ''The Army is divesting itself of noncore functions. Housing was the first, and hotels were a natural follow-on. This is something the private sector does well and it makes sense for them to do it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The primary guests at Army hotels are soldiers who are participating in training, receiving medical treatment or waiting for permanent housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using its housing privatization program, which dates to 1996, as a blueprint, the Army decided it was cheaper and faster for outsiders, rather than the government, to upgrade its hotels. More than 80 percent of Army lodging needed repairs or replacement, according to a 2010 Government Accountability Office report, which would cost the government over $1.8 billion and take more than 20 years to complete. The Army expects it will take eight years using civilian companies. (The other military branches are not privatizing their hotels.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the program, the Army passes ownership of the hotels to a subsidiary of the Australian giant Lend Lease, and retains ownership of the land. The <span class="companylink">InterContinental Hotels Group</span>, or IHG, operates the hotels under the Holiday Inn Express and Candlewood Suites brands. After a 50-year lease, the buildings will revert to the Army. The Lend Lease subsidiary also raises money for the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are three phases to the program. The first, which included the Fort Hood hotel, covered 3,400 rooms on 10 installations. The second phase will cover 4,800 rooms on 11 bases, and next spring, the Army plans to transfer the third group of hotels, or 7,000 rooms, to Lend Lease to start construction and renovation. All three phases are being financed by debt and income from the hotels themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The money to pay off the loans comes largely from soldiers traveling on military business, who are paid a per diem as reimbursement for lodging, meals and incidental expenses. With early-morning wake-up calls and often long security waits at entry gates, it is often easier to stay on a post. The hotel rates are approximately 75 percent of the government's local per diem; at Fort Hood, the average per diem is $77 this year. Lend Lease and IHG receive fees; earnings go back to the hotels for reinvestment and are not taken out of the program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the threat of base closings and cuts in training missions loom in the background, analysts say the privatization program will continue because the Army will have to train soldiers regardless of potential cuts to the Department of Defense's budget or the drawdown of troops in Afghanistan and the end of the war in Iraq. The Army's partners in the deal, Lend Lease and the <span class="companylink">InterContinental Hotels Group</span>, give added confidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What makes this deal strong is that it's tied to the military,'' said Mikiyon Alexander, director for United States public finance at <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Rating Services in New York. ''You can actually tell what demand will be.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We still believe cash flow will come in as expected,'' he added. ''It's a pretty solid deal.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Holiday Inn Express at Fort Hood is a good example of what is to come at other Army bases. The interior was gutted at the hotel, which must meet the same standards as those off post. New furniture was brought in and service standards upgraded. Renovated hotels will operate under the Holiday Inn Express name, while new ones will be branded as Candlewood Suites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're exposing millions of people on an ongoing basis to what branded hotels look like,'' said Arthur Holst, the vice president for operations at IHG Army Hotels in Atlanta. ''They're getting the benefits of the brands and some other special offerings.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amenities were added to cater to military travelers, including weekly barbecues, courtesy shuttles, full-time concierges and free laundry facilities and DVD rentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a big departure from Army-run hotels, where quality was often mixed. Some looked and felt like old barracks, like the large hotel at Fort Leonard Wood in Missouri, where rooms had linoleum floors and fluorescent lights. The biggest luxury was a digital clock. The renovation of that hotel started last fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We were back in the bedspread and 19-inch TV era,'' said Sandy Van Bibber, the general manager of the Holiday Inn Express on Fort Hood. ''You might go to a hotel that's great and another that is not so great. No one likes to travel and get a surprise.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lend Lease and IHG plan to do more at Fort Hood, the country's biggest Army base. Ground is to be broken for a new Candlewood Suites hotel this fall. Two other aging hotels on post, with a total of 193 rooms, will be demolished after the Candlewood Suites opens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the upgrades and the somewhat captive market, Lend Lease is not assuming these hotels will be an easy sell. ''Soldiers don't have to stay at a hotel,'' said Charles Smith, a senior vice president for lodging at Lend Lease. ''We still have to provide a high class of service. Otherwise, they can vote with their feet.''</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">A Suburban-Style Mall Is Rising in the Bronx</span>
</div><div class="author">By JULIE SATOW </div><div>1111 words</div><div>13 June 2012</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2012 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indoor malls in New York have received a mixed reception. Outlets like Pier 17 at the South Street Seaport and the Albee Square Mall in Downtown Brooklyn have posted lackluster performances. But the shops at the Time Warner Center and the Manhattan Mall in Midtown have generally been considered successes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the developers of the first suburban-style fashion mall to be built in New York City in nearly 40 years -- an indoor shopping center with several levels and bookended by department stores -- are taking something of a chance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mall at Bay Plaza, a 780,000-square-foot behemoth, broke ground last month in the Bronx and is scheduled for completion in 2014, at a cost of $300 million. Its developers, Prestige Properties, point to several factors that they say will ensure its success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mall's location, at the crossroads of the Hutchinson Parkway and Interstate 95 near Co-op City in the Bronx, is convenient to residents inside the borough as well as to suburban communities in Westchester County, the developer said. Some 1.4 million people live within a 10-mile radius.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And two strong anchor tenants, <span class="companylink">J. C. Penney</span> and <span class="companylink">Macy's</span>, are on board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is an underserved market and we are confident it will draw crowds,'' said Sam Shalem, the chairman and chief executive of Prestige Properties. Prestige acquired the land on which the mall is being constructed in 1985, and it is part of a 78-acre site. The mall will be adjacent to the outdoor Bay Plaza Shopping Center, which has more than one million square feet of retail, including big-box stores like <span class="companylink">Barnes &amp; Noble</span>, Kmart and P. C. Richards, and 150,000 square feet of commercial office space. On the larger swath of land it owns there, Prestige has plans to eventually build residential towers, Mr. Shalem said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mall will create more than 2,000 construction jobs and 1,700 permanent jobs, according to the city and the developer. Prestige ''is casting a major vote of confidence in the future of the Bronx and the future of New York City,'' said Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg at the recent groundbreaking at the site, which was also attended by local officials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barry Fishbach, an executive vice president at the retail brokerage firm RKF, said having an outdoor mall next door would help attract shoppers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The existing 150,000-square-foot <span class="companylink">J. C. Penney</span> at the Bay Plaza Shopping Center will be attached to the new mall and join a new, ground-up <span class="companylink">Macy's</span> department store as the anchor tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decision by <span class="companylink">Macy's</span> to build a three-level, 160,000-square foot store at the site is a main reason Prestige Properties is moving ahead with developing the mall. ''We had been talking to <span class="companylink">Macy's</span> for years, but we finally showed them the light,'' Mr. Shalem said, ''and it was in large part because a number of other stores in the shopping center, including <span class="companylink">J. C. Penney</span> and Kmart, are in the No. 1 range for their respective chains'' in terms of sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Randy Scalise, the regional director of stores for <span class="companylink">Macy's</span>, said, ''We had been interested in the site for years, but with the economy now stabilizing, we are now able to invest in new stores.'' The new location, he added, ''allows us to infill our store count in the region and makes a lot of sense for us. There is not a lot of mall development in the U.S. right now and the New York metro area is a good market to be in.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter Ripka, a partner at the retail brokerage firm Ripco Real Estate, which is not involved in the marketing of the development, said that having two anchor tenants and being in a prime location were both good indicators of success. ''You have to love a site that has access from two major highways,'' he said. ''A good highway network means people can come from a large radius.'' There will also be some 230 buses stopping daily at the mall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is little direct competition in the area. The closest fashion mall is the Cross County Shopping Center in Yonkers, which is north and west of the Mall at Bay Plaza. The other option in the Bronx is the Gateway Center in the Bronx Terminal Market, which does not have a fashion focus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Gateway Center in the Bronx Terminal Market is more of a vertical power center, which means it is more like a shopping center and won't have similar fashion retailers,'' Mr. Ripka said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mall at Bay Plaza will include an 1,800-spot parking garage and as many as 80 smaller retail stores. Asking rents will range from $100 a square foot to more than $200 a square foot, said Jerry Welkis, the president of Welco Realty, a retail brokerage firm. With his partner Allen Cooperman, a principal, he is spearheading the leasing at the Mall at Bay Plaza. They have been marketing the mall since January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Potential tenants who are in discussions to lease space at the mall include Aeropostale, <span class="companylink">H&amp;M</span>, Express, the Gap and Victoria's Secret.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, the mall is in negotiations to sign a 40,000-square-foot health club, and is creating a food court with about 10 vendors. It is in talks with the Cheesecake Factory, Maggiano's Little Italy, Brio Tuscan Grille and <span class="companylink">Texas de Brazil</span> to open two or three sit-down restaurants, and to sign up some fast casual restaurants, including possibly Bobby's Burger Palace and <span class="companylink">Chipotle Mexican Grill</span>. Other nonfashion tenants it has spoken with include the jewelry chain Zales, Build-a-Bear Workshop and Brookstone, Mr. Welkis said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The structure of the mall, with <span class="companylink">Macy's</span> on one side and <span class="companylink">J. C. Penney</span> on the other, is also ideal, Mr. Welkis said. ''The mall is short, so the specialty retailers won't get lost as people walk between the <span class="companylink">J. C. Penney</span>'s and <span class="companylink">Macy's</span>; they will be clearly visible.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are creating a suburban fashion mall in an urban environment,'' Mr. Welkis said, ''but the key to the success is that we have great anchors.'' He continued, ''<span class="companylink">Macy's</span> is considered a fashion outlet while <span class="companylink">J. C. Penney</span> has tremendous reach as a moderately priced department store, so we are offering the best of both worlds.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AMERICANS are used to recessions, but they are also used to relatively fast recoveries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, however, is the first time in more than half a century that the average American is both earning less and worth less than four years earlier, at least after inflation is factored in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The genesis of that fall was, of course, the financial crisis and the sharp decline in the value of homes, the principal asset of most Americans, followed by the sharp drop in stock prices. The crisis led to stubbornly high unemployment that cut income for many Americans and made wage increases harder to obtain for those who did hold on to their jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> estimated this week that the value of owner-occupied real estate rose 2.3 percent in the first quarter of this year, the first such increase since 2010. Even with that gain, those homes are now estimated to be worth $16.4 trillion, 28 percent below the peak set in 2006. Some of that reduction is caused by the fact that fewer Americans now own their homes, but much of it reflects lower values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Total household net worth rose 4.7 percent to $62.9 trillion in the quarter but was still nearly 7 percent below the peak set in 2007. That figure is exaggerated because it includes nonprofit organizations, but the Fed says there is no way to separate them out. The per capita net worth of Americans at the end of the quarter exceeded $200,000 for the first time since 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The picture is not quite as bleak for disposable personal income — the money Americans have left over after paying taxes. On a nominal basis, it exceeded the old record last year, and has continued to grow. But after adjusting for inflation, the average American still earns less now than six years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The accompanying charts show four-year changes in per capita disposable personal income and in per capita household wealth. Each chart shows the nominal changes and the changes adjusted for inflation. At the right of each chart, in dotted lines, are the net changes since the first quarter of 2009, when President Obama took office. In each case, the numbers are now up, although the gain in per capita disposable income, after adjusting for inflation, is a tiny 0.2 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But much of his administration has seen four-year changes that are unprecedented since the Fed began calculating the net worth figures in 1952.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As can be seen from the lower chart, real per capita net worth did decline over four-year periods in the 1970s and again after the end of the technology stock bubble in 2001. But nominal per capita net worth had not suffered such a fall until the current cycle. Moreover, while the 2001 decline was concentrated among stock market investors, who tend to be wealthier than average, the plunge in housing prices hurt far more people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first quarter of this year, per capita disposable personal income was up just 4.7 percent from four years ago. That is the smallest such gain since the late 1940s, when the number was influenced by the fall in government spending after World War II[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/w/world_war_ii_/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier]. Adjusted for inflation, the average American now has income that is 2.1 percent lower than four years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barring a new economic downturn, both per capita net worth and disposable income will be higher when President Obama’s term ends than they were when it began. The election may turn on whether to focus on that fact instead of the declines during much of his term.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DEVELOPERS in New York City have had a lot of success luring buyers to high-end apartments with the latest dazzling amenity. Heat reflexology flooring, anyone?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the feature still most likely to draw people is not something new and shiny but old and reliable: good bones. Many buyers re-entering the real estate market after years on the sidelines are discovering what they're after in brownstone Brooklyn. In neighborhoods including Fort Greene, Park Slope, Boerum Hill and Red Hook, brokers are besieged by buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is amazing,'' said Jill Seligson Braver, an associate broker at Brown Harris Stevens. ''It is a level of activity I have not seen since 2006-2007. There are so many people looking for brownstone buildings, and there is just no supply.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Braver said that when it comes to brownstones, good bones can mean many things: striking period details, ornate moldings, gracious floor plans. But always, they offer a sense of solidity. ''Brownstones signify stability,'' she said. ''Putting roots down in a neighborhood for the long haul.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not uncommon for dozens of people to jam open houses or for bidding wars to leave the listing price in the dust. With so few single-family homes available, buyers have also been eagerly snatching up two- and three-family homes with the goal of converting them to single-family residences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of Ms. Braver's clients, Phil Gennaway, bought a brownstone in Carroll Gardens in 1974 for $50,000. For four decades, the three-story multifamily home has done its duty -- serving for a time as a home for Mr. Gennaway and his wife and later as a dependable source of rental income when the couple moved out of the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after incurring some unexpected medical expenses last year, Mr. Gennaway decided that it was time to cash out. He was advised to wait until spring, and on April 30 he listed the building for $1.6 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gennaway, who has spent many years appraising property values in the city, was surprised by what happened next.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After three group showings and less than one week on the market, he received nine bids -- at which point his broker stopped taking offers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building is in contract for an amount higher than the asking price. Mr. Gennaway would not reveal the sales price before the deal closed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though the most desirable neighborhoods in Brooklyn were never hit as hard by the recession as less established areas, the current frenzy in the brownstone market is more a reflection of the continuing demand for large spaces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan J. Miller, who analyzes market data for Prudential Douglas Elliman, broke down the data on sales of one-, two- and three-family homes and found that prices in northwest Brooklyn were up significantly from this time last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Park Slope by the end of April, the median sales price had jumped nearly 20 percent over the same period last year, to $1.45 million from $1.2 million. The number of sales in the neighborhood is also up: 158 this year compared with 132 last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest price increases have been in Boerum Hill -- up 60 percent, to $1.7 million from $1.1 million -- and Red Hook -- up 73 percent, to $825,000 from $475,000, although it is a small neighborhood and only a handful of properties were on the market. In some cases, homes are selling for more than what they might have brought in the heady days of 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even when the most expensive sales are removed from the calculations, Mr. Miller said, the surge in prices in striking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The theory was that when the credit crunch hit, you would see home sizes get smaller,'' he said, ''and that is not what happened in New York.'' Across the city, he added, space is king.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spiraling prices are being driven, in part, by the lack of supply. Despite the rising demand, no one is building new brownstones. The number of town houses on the market this spring is about the same as it was a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks, still applying much stricter lending standards than in the boom years, have also been slightly more accommodating. Mortgage interest rates are still at record lows, and with prices rising, some buyers who had been on the sidelines waiting for the market to bottom out are taking the plunge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is a lot of money out there,'' said Trish Martin, the director of sales in Brooklyn for Halstead Property. But people are cautious, looking to invest in areas that held their value even when times were tough. ''We would love to point people to other burgeoning neighborhoods,'' she said, ''but people have it set in their head that they want a specific neighborhood.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miller says prices are rising the fastest in ''core'' neighborhoods -- the ones that did not see much fluctuation when the economic climate changed.Right now, within those neighborhoods, the greatest demand is for the small clusters of brownstone blocks. Despite the robust spring sales of large homes, studio and one-bedroom apartments in northwest Brooklyn have not proved as resilient, with prices still off from their peak levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising rents are also driving more people into the sales market. In April, the average rent in Park Slope was up 33 percent from the previous spring, according to a survey by MNS Realty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past, the people hunting for brownstones were often Manhattanites looking for more affordable space across the East River. While such people are still coming to Brooklyn, brokers say, buyers are just as likely to be longtime Brooklyn residents hoping to get out of the rental market or move up the property ladder. Brokers are also seeing an increasing number of new arrivals to New York looking exclusively in Brooklyn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of it has to do with the continuing and increasing popularity of the neighborhoods,'' said Leslie Marshall, a senior vice president of Corcoran. ''You can't open papers without reading about some style trend that started in Brooklyn or some new restaurant that everyone is talking about. It has been infectious.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate obsessives have taken note as young Hollywood stars like Maggie Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway colonized Brooklyn. With all this buzz, the idea of the borough as consolation for those priced out of Manhattan seems thoroughly passe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neely Cather, who just listed her Brooklyn Heights brownstone for $3.65 million, is one of those who were drawn to Brooklyn because they wanted a different vibe than the one they found in Manhattan -- less rushed, with the feel of a village, but still urban.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is just very difficult to find this kind of neighborhood, where you know everyone on the street,'' Ms. Cather said. She described her neighbors as an ''open, educated, cultured group.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building is being shown by appointment through her broker, Ms. Marshall, at Corcoran. The interest has been intense, she said. Both Manhattanites and Brooklynites have inquired about the property. Ms. Cather said the actress Mary-Louise Parker had stopped by on her house hunt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Cathers, who plan to spend time at their place upstate, are not leaving Brooklyn entirely. They bought a condominium nearby at One Brooklyn Bridge Park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea was to have ''city living when we are in the city,'' she said, and to stay in the neighborhood they love.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kwadwo Boachie-Adjei, an epidemiologist at Beth Israel Medical Center, is similarly committed to Brooklyn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He moved to New York from Boston after he had finished graduate school in 2003. At that point, he said, he ''joined the long list of renters.'' He resolved to save money, search for the right neighborhood and buy something as soon as he could afford it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But then the prices skyrocketed,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was living in Fort Greene in 2005, and his rent kept rising along with home prices so, despite the risk, he decided to buy a place. As the market neared its peak late that year, he paid $900,000 for a three-family brownstone at 411 Classon Avenue. He lived in the building and rented out two other apartments, but did little in the way of renovations. He is now putting the place on the market for $1.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price increase, he believes, has been made possible by all that has developed around the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Over the years, the neighborhood has changed so drastically,'' he said. ''There are condos being built around the block, and there are now four restaurants on opposite corners, which you see as soon as you walk out of the building.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a landlord, he finds tenants often ask him about buying in the neighborhood. Unfortunately, he said, many are frustrated because there is simply so little inventory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Boachie-Adjei, gaining confidence after his first purchase, bought another brownstone nearby several years ago for $1.16 million. Unable to secure financing for renovations at the time, he had to let the house sit vacant until he could get the money together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a reflection of how strong the market is today, even after some very rough years, his new brownstone -- work completed -- was recently appraised at $2.5 million. All things considered, he said, it was a very good investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: June 10, 2012, Sunday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A chart last Sunday with an article about rising prices for town houses in brownstone Brooklyn misstated the listing and sales prices for a house at 124 Park Place in Park Slope.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN the world of high-end real estate, it can be tough for other cities to keep up with Manhattan[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/classifieds/realestate/locations/newyork/newyorkcity/manhattan/?inline=nyt-geo] and Beverly Hills, with all the star power and headlines generated by 20-something heiresses paying more than $80 million apiece for trophy homes — a kind of bicoastal battle of blank-check buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But don’t count out South Florida[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/great-homes-and-destinations/destinations/south-florida/index.html?inline=nyt-geo]. The high-end market in Miami-Dade County may not have a Petra Ecclestone or Ekaterina Rybolovleva jetting in to spend money from her billionaire father, but its selling environment, once synonymous with bust, is seeing signs of a boom again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two weeks ago, a penthouse owned by Alex Birkenstock (from the German shoe company loved by the hippie crowd) sold for $25 million, a record apartment sale, to an Italian who controls an investment company. In recent days, a developer’s 10-bedroom home on the exclusive Indian Creek Island, listed for $52 million, went into contract to a foreign buyer, brokers said. The price was not disclosed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If that deal closes, it will very likely top the post-bubble record for a residential property sale in Miami-Dade County, currently held by Edward Lampert, a hedge-fund billionaire, who bought a house on Indian Creek in March for $38.4 million, brokers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Everything is kind of selling now,” said Jill Hertzberg, one half of “The Jills,” a broker duo for Coldwell Banker in Miami[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/great-homes-and-destinations/destinations/south-florida/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] who are co-listing the 10-bedroom home, at 3 Indian Creek Drive, which features a “7-limo-size” garage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“You wonder how long it will last,” Ms. Hertzberg said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pending sale on Indian Creek — home to Julio Iglesias and Norman Braman, a billionaire art collector and former owner of the Philadelphia Eagles — is the latest in a string of homes and lots that have sold on the island over the last three months. All of the sales have been over $10 million, and most have been by longtime residents acquiring neighboring properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New listings are carrying enormous price tags. The steel magnate Leroy Schecter recently put his 21,746-square-foot home on Indian Creek up for sale for $45 million. This week, Ian Bruce Eichner, a New York developer, raised the listing price of his 11,031-square-foot penthouse at Continuum towers in Miami Beach to $39 million from $35 million, to be “in line with the market,” said Dora Puig, the listing agent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“This has been a market-moving year for Miami Beach,” Ms. Puig said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It wasn’t always like this. Since 2006, when housing prices peaked, Miami has been widely viewed as the “poster child for distressed real estate,” with two-thirds of all sales being distressed as recently as 2010, said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of Miller Samuel, a real estate appraiser.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But price jumps[http://www.millersamuel.com/files/2012/04/Miami_Q1_2012.pdf] at the high end of the market are sharply outpacing the rest of it. The average price of a single-family home in the top 10 percent of sales — over $1.75 million — rose 22.1 percent over the past year, versus 4.5 percent for the overall nondistressed single-family segment, Mr. Miller said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The run of big sales and bigger price increases started in December with a penthouse at the Setai Resort and Residences that sold to Kenneth C. Griffin, a Chicago hedge-fund billionaire, for $21.5 million, a record at the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“That lit the fuse,” Ms. Puig said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, in February, Alberto Bulus, the son-in-law of a wealthy insurance family from Rio de Janeiro, bought a 6,100-square-foot apartment in the Continuum for $16.2 million. (Mr. Bulus also owns a triplex penthouse of some 14,000 square feet in the Ipanema neighborhood of Rio overlooking the ocean, according to O Estado de S. Paulo, a Brazilian newspaper.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Apogee, another luxury condo complex in Miami Beach, an apartment bought by a Russian couple for $11.5 million in April of last year is now listed for $25 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Puig said one of her listings, a penthouse at the Icon condominium, in South Beach, recently went into contract to a Latin American buyer above the asking price of $19 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Indian Creek, just north of Miami Beach, the buying and selling pace has been faster than a cigarette powerboat. A half-dozen lots and homes have traded since last July, four since March. The village is among the most exclusive in the country, with only 32 houses surrounding a top golf course. Other residents include the Brazilian supermodel Adriana Lima, the former Miami Dolphins coach Don Shula, the billionaire investor Carl Icahn and Mario Luis Kreutzberger Blumenfeld, a TV presenter known by his stage name, Don Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The security on Indian Creek is tight. Unlike Star Island, which I visited in February, it has restricted access, because the road leading in is owned by the country club. A police force of 10 sworn officers protects 86 residents. The village even has its own 24-hour armed boat patrol.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All the homes are on the water. Mr. Schecter’s home has 7 bedrooms, 14 bathrooms and 200 feet of waterfront. He listed it for $32 million in 2008 and raised the price that year to $35 million before taking it off the market in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent spate of sales, including the record-breaker to Mr. Lampert, who lives next door, justified the $45 million asking price, said Nelson Gonzalez of EWM Realtors, the listing broker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(The 85-year-old Mr. Schecter, who has pledged to give 90 percent of his wealth to charity, also owns two apartments on the 35th floor at 15 Central Park West, one of which he rented to Alex Rodriguez of the <span class="companylink">New York Yankees</span>. They are being renovated, a spokeswoman said. Last year he tried to sell them together for $55 million.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lately, longtime residents of Indian Creek have been doing most of the buying. Earlier this month Mr. Iglesias bought an 80,000-square-foot lot for $15.2 million; he now owns nearly 7 acres, Mr. Gonzalez said. At least two others, including Robert Diener, a co-founder of hotels.com, and Jaime Gillinski, a Colombian banker, have also bought more property there this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It really is a couple of families that are trying to control the island,” said Oren Alexander, a broker with Prudential Douglas Elliman who is co-listing 3 Indian Creek Drive, the home listed for $52 million that is now under contract. (His father, Shlomi Alexander, built the home.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or they are simply realizing that one day soon there won’t be any more waterfront property on which to build new trophy mansions — no matter how much an heiress is willing to pay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The future of extremely high-end real estate in Miami Beach,” Mr. Gonzalez said, “will be land.”</p>

</div><div class="author">By REUTERS   </div><div>312 words</div><div>31 May 2012</div><div>NYTimes.com Feed</div><div>NYTFEED</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2012. The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON (Reuters) — The number of people signing contracts to buy previously owned homes unexpectedly fell in April to a four-month low, undermining some of the recent optimism that the housing sector was nearing a bottom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors[http://www.realtor.org/news-releases/2012/05/pending-home-sales-decline-in-april-but-up-strongly-from-a-year-ago] said Wednesday that its index of pending home sales, based on contracts signed last month, fell 5.5 percent, to 95.5, its lowest level since December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The series still remained sharply higher from a year earlier, and economists said the data did not change the view that the American economy remained in recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The drop in pending home sales is clearly disappointing,” said Pierre Ellis, an economist at Decision Economics. “It remains to be seen whether this is the beginning of a real downturn.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists polled by Reuters had expected signed contracts, which lead home sales by a month or two, to rise 0.1 percent after a previously reported 4.1 percent gain in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has been one of the economy’s weakest links as it recovers from the recession[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/r/recession_and_depression/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], but many economists believe the sector will add to economic growth in 2012 for the first time in seven years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report on pending contracts in April could temper some of that optimism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also casting a shadow, applications for home mortgages fell last week as refinance demand faltered, even as mortgage rates hit another record low. The Mortgage Bankers Association said its seasonally adjusted index of mortgage application activity, which includes both refinancing and home purchase demand, decreased 1.3 percent last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors report showed that signed contracts to buy homes fell 12 percent in the West and 6.8 percent in the South. They edged lower in the Midwest and rose slightly in the Northeast.</p>

</div><div class="author">By CHRISTOPHER B. LEINBERGER   </div><div>875 words</div><div>27 May 2012</div><div>NYTimes.com Feed</div><div>NYTFEED</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2012. The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WALKING isn’t just good for you. It has&nbsp;become an indicator of your socioeconomic status.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until the 1990s, exclusive suburban homes that were accessible only by car cost more, per square foot, than other kinds of American housing. Now, however, these suburbs have become overbuilt, and housing values have fallen. Today, the most valuable real estate lies in walkable urban locations. Many of these now pricey places were slums just 30 years ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mariela Alfonzo and I just released a Brookings Institution study[http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2012/05/25-walkable-places-leinberger] that measures values of commercial and residential real estate in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area, which includes the surrounding suburbs in Virginia and Maryland.&nbsp;Our research shows that real estate values increase as neighborhoods became more walkable, where everyday needs, including working, can be met by walking, transit or biking. There is a five-step “ladder” of walkability, from least to most walkable. On average, each step up the walkability ladder adds $9 per square foot to annual office rents, $7 per square foot to retail rents, more than $300 per month to apartment rents and nearly $82 per square foot to home values.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a neighborhood moves up each step of the five-step walkability ladder, the average household income of those who live there increases some $10,000. People who live in more walkable places tend to earn more, but they also tend to&nbsp;pay a higher percentage of their income for housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although we have not studied all urban areas to the same degree, these findings appear to apply to much of the rest of the country. In metropolitan Seattle in 1996, the suburban Redmond area, home to <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span>, had the same price per square foot as Capitol Hill, a walkable area adjacent to downtown, based on data from Zillow[http://www.zillow.com/]. Today, Capitol Hill is valued nearly 50 percent above Redmond.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Columbus, Ohio, the highest housing values recorded by Zillow in 1996 were in the suburb of Worthington, where prices were 135 percent higher than in the struggling neighborhood of Short North, adjacent to the city’s center.&nbsp; Today, Short North housing values are 30 percent&nbsp;higher than those of Worthington, and downtown Columbus has the highest housing values in that metropolitan area.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Denver area, Highlands Ranch, an upscale, master-planned community 20 miles south of downtown, had housing in 1996 that cost on average 21 percent more than housing in Highlands, a troubled neighborhood adjacent to downtown Denver. Today, Highlands has a 67 percent&nbsp;price premium over Highlands Ranch.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People are clearly willing to pay more for homes that allow them to walk rather than drive.&nbsp;Biking is part of the picture, too. Biking and walking are part of a “complete streets” strategy that public rights of way should be for all of society — not just cars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in bike-sharing systems in Minneapolis, metropolitan Washington, and soon New York City makes it possible to imagine a future in which a third of a city’s population gets around primarily by bicycle.&nbsp;The popular Web site Walk Score[http://www.walkscore.com/] has just added Bike Score[http://www.walkscore.com/bike] to let people know which neighborhoods are most bikable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for walkable urban space extends beyond city centers to suburbs; in metropolitan Washington, more than half of the walkable places are in the suburbs, like Reston Town Center, 22 miles from downtown Washington; Ballston, in Arlington County; and Silver Spring, in suburban Maryland. Residents can easily get to grocery stores, cafes, libraries and work by rail transit, biking and walking.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why is there an urbanization of the suburbs? Some baby boomers want to sell their large suburban houses and move to a walkable urban place but stay close to friends and family. Young families want the advantages of walkable urban life but also high-quality suburban schools. This trend is about both the revitalization of center cities and the urbanization of the suburbs.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To address the affordability challenge, a sensible strategy would include changes like zoning that allows homes with units in the back or over the garage. But the long-term solution is encouraging the building of more walkable places, which will reduce the price premiums by creating more supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(Disclosure: I am the president of Locus, a coalition of real estate developers and investors, and a project of Smart Growth America, which supports walkable neighborhoods and transit-oriented development.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Different infrastructure needs to be built, including rail transit and paths for walking and biking. Some research has shown that walkable urban infrastructure is substantially cheaper on a usable square foot basis than spread-out drivable suburban infrastructure; the infrastructure is used much more extensively in a small area, resulting in much lower costs per usable square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It’s important that developers and their investors learn how to build places that integrate many different uses within walking distance. Building walkable urban places is more complex and riskier than following decades-long patterns of suburban construction. But the market gets what it wants, and the market signals are flashing pretty brightly: build more walkable, and bikable, places.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ARE government-imposed limits on borrowing a good thing?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It appears that they have worked wonders in Texas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Statistics compiled by the National Association of Realtors indicate that in only two of the 20 largest metropolitan areas in the United States have the median prices of homes sold returned to 2006 levels — Houston and Dallas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Texas would seem to have many advantages over other states. Its unemployment rate has been lower, and high oil prices have helped a principal industry. Home prices rose less there than in many places during the boom, and thus may not have been as inflated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a major difference between Texas and other states during the boom was that Texas required any homeowner seeking to refinance a mortgage or take out a home equity loan[http://topics.nytimes.com/your-money/loans/home-equity-loans/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] to have at least 20 percent equity after taking out the new loan. Moreover, no one could refinance a home mortgage more often than once a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The state was not spared all the excesses of the mortgage boom, said John Fleming, the general counsel of the Texas Mortgage Bankers Association, who also teaches consumer credit law at the University of Texas School of Law. “We had the no-documentation loans, the option-ARM loans and all the others,” he said, referring to loans made to borrowers who did not provide evidence of income or assets, and to adjustable-rate mortgages with low initial interest rates and low required monthly payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were no limits on how much a bank could lend to someone buying a home, and in some parts of Texas, subdivisions sold with easy-credit loans have been devastated by foreclosures[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/f/foreclosures/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] since prices fell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it was not possible for Texas homeowners to take out all their equity when credit was easy and prices high. As a result, people who bought their homes before prices peaked are less likely to owe more than the home is now worth, and less likely to be forced to sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The accompanying charts show the national median sales price for existing homes from the end of 2000 through April of this year, as well as prices in the 20 largest metropolitan areas. The national figure rose in April to the highest level since the summer of 2010, as is indicated in the top chart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The monthly figures can be volatile, since more homes may sell in higher-priced areas in one month, and more in lower-cost areas in another. To smooth the figures, an average of the median prices for the most recent 12 months is also shown. It, too, has begun to rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors group also calculates median sales prices in many metropolitan areas on a quarterly basis. The charts compare prices in 2006 with the average of the four most recent quarters in the 20 largest areas. Most areas are down sharply. In all likelihood, the declines are caused in part by declines in the housing market and in part by a shift in the mix, so that more lower-priced homes are being sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some markets, the median price is no doubt depressed by the fact that many foreclosed homes, often in poor condition, have come onto the market. It is likely that the Texas areas look better in part because the home equity law — which is in the State Constitution — prevented many homeowners from getting in over their heads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How did Texas end up with such a law? Mr. Fleming said that when Texas was being settled, its founder, Stephen F. Austin, got the Legislature of Coahuila, the Mexican state that included Texas, to protect land purchasers from having their homes seized to pay off other debts they had incurred. He feared that settlers from the East would otherwise be chased by creditors. Similar provisions have been in every Texas State Constitution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until 1997, home equity loans were not legal at all in Texas, to the dismay of banks. In that year, voters approved a provision passed by the Legislature that allowed such loans, but set forth the limits still in force.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks are preparing to push to amend the law, Mr. Fleming said in an interview. They say that some homeowners with home equity loans have been unable to refinance high-interest-rate loans because a current appraisal shows their equity is now less than 20 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there appears to be widespread support for retaining the limit, at least on new home equity loans. There are many people in Texas who might have lost their homes had there been no such limit, and many in other states who might have kept theirs had a similar law been in effect across the country.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spring home-selling season got off to a strong start in April, the Commerce Department said Wednesday, with rising sales and prices providing evidence that a housing market recovery was gaining some traction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The residential real estate sector has been the Achilles’ heel of the economy ever since the housing bubble burst. Data this week, however, has painted an upbeat picture for the market and underscored the economy’s resilience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The recent buoyancy in housing market activity has raised hopes that this beleaguered sector may finally be on the verge of a rebound,” said Millan Mulraine, senior macro strategist at <span class="companylink">TD Securities</span> in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales increased 3.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted 343,000-unit annual rate, the Commerce Department said. Compared with April last year, sales were up 9.9 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report came on the heels of news on Tuesday that home resales hit a two-year high, with the sector getting support from investors who are increasingly seeing value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even more encouraging, the median price for both new and previously owned homes surged last month, a further sign of life for a market that has struggled to come back from its 2006 collapse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of a new home rose to $235,700 last month, up 4.9 percent from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report from the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> showed house prices in March were up 2.7 percent from a year ago, the largest gain since November 2006. The increase reflected a 1.8 percent rise in March from February, the biggest monthly increase on records dating to 1991.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, prices by the finance agency’s measure remain about 18 percent below the peak reached in April 2007. Other measures suggest prices have even further to climb to make up the lost ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Even though we have seen home prices start to turn, our concern is that in the second half of the year as more foreclosures come into the market, we could see a dip in prices,” said Jeremy Lawson, a senior economist at <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas</span> in New York.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHEN AvalonBay Communities[http://www.avaloncommunities.com/new-jersey/north-bergen-apartments/avalon-north-bergen/] opened its mixed-use apartment complex in North Bergen in early April, 150 people stopped by the first weekend, and 20 signed leases. The 164-unit project is now 40 percent full. At Stafford Park[http://www.staffordparkapts.com/] in Manahawkin, the Walters Group has already leased all 36 apartments in the first three buildings of a planned 18-building complex, even though the first building will not open until July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent reports on real estate activity in the first quarter of 2012 indicate a continued shakeout for home buyers and sellers, but the rental market is another story entirely. The less-than-promising sales numbers are evidence of a market that has not quite fully corrected itself, New Jersey[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/classifieds/realestate/locations/newjersey/?inline=nyt-geo] housing experts say, while the strong rental market makes perfect sense given the state’s shifting demographics and job opportunities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The decline in homeownership rates is really a correction of the housing bubble,” said James W. Hughes[http://policy.rutgers.edu/faculty/hughes/], dean of the Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, in reference to a new census report that found homeownership nationwide had fallen to a 15-year low of 65.4 percent, versus a high of 69.2 percent in 2004. “There were many people who shouldn’t have been homeowners, and now they’re not going to be.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New Jersey, the ownership drop has been even steeper: to 64.4 percent the first quarter of this year from a high of 71.3 percent in early 2005, according to data compiled by the Otteau Valuation Group[http://www.otteau.com/index.aspx]. The company president, Jeffrey Otteau, pointed to the 8.2 million homes around the country that have received foreclosure notices as proof that “homeownership rates rose to unsustainable levels.” Factor in job loss and declines in income, he said, and the result is “a large share of households nationally and in New Jersey that found homeownership unaffordable.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The obvious alternative: renting. Nationwide, 34 percent are now renting, compared with 31 percent in 2005. In New Jersey over the first quarter, the renting population was at 35.6 percent. Mr. Hughes attributed the strong market to three factors: retiring baby boomers looking to reduce their commitments; those baby boomers’ children who are just entering the workplace and find renting suits their incomes and lifestyle; and the state’s growing immigrant population that veers toward urban markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The resulting rental boom has been much needed, according to Mr. Hughes, who predicted that the housing market would tilt toward the rental side for the remainder of the decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Three or four years from now, if they keep building at the rate they’re building now, the possibility of overbuilding is very real,” he said. “But the demand right now is still very strong.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based upon the number of applicants for the apartments in Manahawkin, Ed Walters, president of the Walters Group[http://www.waltershomes.com/PublicPages/Home.aspx] in Barnegat, is not too worried at this point about oversaturating the rental market. “In New Jersey,” Mr. Walters said, “it’s so hard to get land approved to build apartments, it’s almost impossible to overbuild.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His company began in 1984 building residential subdivisions in Ocean County but did not build its first rental property, a 310-apartment project in Barnegat, until 2004. Two years later the company closed on 98 single-family homes, but sold only 23 in 2009 — a clear sign that it needed to move in another direction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the Walters Group’s current projects on the books, it hopes to satisfy all market segments. When completed, Stafford Park, a mixed-use development on a 370-acre former brownfield, will have a residential component consisting of 216 market-rate rentals, 112 affordable housing units, and a subdivision of 349 single-family houses. The company is also building an 82-unit rental complex in Haddon Township in Camden County.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AvalonBay has long recognized the value of the rental apartment business, having focused on this segment of the housing market since its inception in 1993. With the same three demographic sectors in mind that Mr. Hughes cited, Ron Ladell[http://www.multihousingnews.com/newsinbrief/avalonbay%E2%80%99s-ron-ladell-promoted-to-senior-vice-president/1004043321.html], a senior vice president, said AvalonBay, a publicly traded real estate investment trust company, was actively pursuing the growing rental population. With 4,800 rental apartments already on its books in New Jersey, AvalonBay has an additional 1,178 opening in the next nine months in Hackensack, Woodridge, North Bergen and Franklin Township.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for other developers now diving into this market, Mr. Ladell said he welcomed competition but warned: “It’s not as easy as you think. You need a lot of upfront capital. And New Jersey remains one of the most difficult places to get approvals.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Strong demand has been reducing vacancy rates while pushing rents ever higher, according to the Otteau data. The average vacancy rate for rental apartments statewide is now at 3.7 percent, the lowest level since 2001. Mr. Otteau defined this as “virtually full occupancy,” figuring in a two-week turnover time between annual renters. And rents — for a typical unit, built in 1965 with one to two bedrooms — are averaging $1,274 a month, 2 percent above the $1,249 of a year ago. In the newer luxury apartments, rents can run much higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gary Large[http://www.prudentialnewjersey.com/gary.large], president of the New Jersey Association of Realtors[http://www.njar.com/], said rents were expected to rise about 10 percent by 2014. That prediction, combined with record low borrowing rates, supports the argument that this is the perfect time to buy, according to Mr. Large, manager of Prudential New Jersey Properties’ Morristown office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One thing is clear, Mr. Large said: Mortgage rates that were at 6 percent in 2003 are now around 4 percent. “If you borrow at that 4 percent, it’s going to stay at that level for the length of the mortgage — while rents will increase every year,” he said. “People need to think about that.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seventeen-seventy-six will never lose its place in the history books, but its claim to the record books may have been undermined by a decision not to build a sculptural cladding for the mast atop 1 World Trade Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mast was to elevate an otherwise 1,368-foot skyscraper into a 1,776-foot structure whose defining measurement was meant to express American spirit and resolve in the face of the terrorist attack of Sept. 11, 2001.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, a private body that serves as a worldwide arbiter of building heights, counts the mast depends on whether it is considered a functional antenna or a nonfunctional spire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While reserving its final decision until 1 World Trade Center is completed in early 2014, the council had previously been inclined to include the mast because it was clad in a fiberglass and steel enclosure called a radome. The radome was a tapering, multifaceted structure of interlocking triangles, 23 feet in diameter at its widest, that had been designed by <span class="companylink">Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill</span> with the sculptor Kenneth Snelson.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without this cladding, the mast is a more straightforward pole of galvanized steel trusswork, about six feet in diameter for much of its height, intersected by wider maintenance platforms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just how perceptible the difference will be from the street or surrounding buildings is hard to say. Though the distinction between the versions seems minuscule on renderings only a few inches high, the mast is more than 400 feet tall - about as tall as a 40-story building - so even the smallest changes are magnified by scale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decision to eliminate the cladding was made in October and affirmed in January byDouglas Durst, the chairman of the Durst Organization, and the <span class="companylink">Port Authority of New York and New Jersey</span>, with which Mr. Durst is developing the building. The change is coming to light with all the attention the project received when the building reached 1,271 feet, making it the tallest in New York City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Should the Council on Tall Buildings ultimately disallow the unclad mast in its height calculation, 1 World Trade Center would lose both its symbolic dimension and its claim to unseating the Willis Tower (formerly the Sears Tower) in Chicago as the tallest building in America. It would not even be the second-tallest building in America. That is the Trump International Hotel and Tower, also in Chicago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This definitely raises questions,'' Kevin Brass, the public affairs manager for the council, said in a statement on Wednesday. ''Our criteria are very specific. We include spires and not antennas. If this is an antenna, it won't be part of the height measurement. The cladding was an integral part of the design and made the extension part of the permanent look and feel of the building.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chief architect of 1 World Trade Center,David M. Childs, was not reticent about calling the resulting structure an antenna as he took a rare step for any architect in publicly criticizing a client.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are disappointed that a decision has been made to remove the sculptural enclosure at the top of 1 World Trade Center,'' Mr. Childs, now a consulting partner at <span class="companylink">Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill</span>, said in a statement. ''Eliminating this integral part of the building's design and leaving an exposed antenna and equipment is unfortunate. We stand ready to work with the port on an alternate design that will still mark the 1 World Trade Center's place in New York City's skyline.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though eliminating the cladding will save about $20 million in construction costs, some of which the Durst Organization will recoup as part of its agreement with the Port Authority, Mr. Durst said that what doomed the radome was the prospect of maintaining such a complex structure more than a quarter-mile in the sky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There was no real method to maintain or repair the radome,'' Mr. Durst said in an interview on Tuesday; his colleagues in the Durst Organization likened any such effort to something out of ''Mission Impossible.'' They said that if one of the hundreds of fiberglass panels in the radome were damaged by lightning or ice, climbers would have to scale it, winches would have to be installed on the upper reaches of the tower, and cables would have to be lowered to the 9/11 Memorial plaza, where replacement pieces weighing thousands of pounds would await.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Durst said the current mast would ''still be a fairly robust structure.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't think it will affect the visual appearance,'' he added. ''I try not to get involved with the aesthetics. We're here to discuss how it's built and how it's maintained.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Port Authority seemed so confident that the issue would be resolved in favor of the 1,776-foot height that a spokesman, Steve Coleman, allowed himself an unusually lighthearted response. ''We confess,'' he said. ''One World Trade Center is really a three-story walk-up in Peoria.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then he added: ''If truth be told, this discussion is irrelevant. One World Trade Center will be the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jordan Barowitz, the director of external affairs at Durst, said: ''When the building is complete in 18 months or so, there will be no broadcast equipment on the spire. It will be a spire, lit with LEDs. I don't know how you could call that an antenna. It's a spire from which broadcast equipment will be suspended.'' He referred to the three steel rings at the base of the mast, which will contain communication equipment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week’s economic news was mixed, but the employment report on Friday was unmistakably weak[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/05/business/economy/us-added-only-115000-jobs-in-april-rate-is-8-1.html?hp]. The economy added only 115,000 jobs in April[http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm], versus 154,000 in March and 200,000-plus in each of the three months before that. Even taking into account that unusually warm winter weather probably distorted the recent results, the underlying trend shows an economy that has been creating about 175,000 jobs a month — enough to keep the recovery crawling along, but too weak to appreciably raise hiring or wages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor is it clear where more growth will come from. Manufacturing picked up last month, but activity in the larger service sector slowed. Recent auto sales were up, and home sales have been slowly, if fitfully, improving, but home prices continue to fall. Consumer spending, in general, rose in the first quarter, but it appears to be driven by people who are profiting from a rising stock market. Increased market volatility, like Friday’s 168-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/05/business/global/daily-stock-market-activity.html], would make them nervous and less inclined to spend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Election-year politics are bound to further confuse the economic picture and the way forward. On Friday, Mitt Romney blamed President Obama for the April jobs figures, saying that in a normal recovery[http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/04/romney-calls-jobs-report-very-very-disappointing/] “we should be seeing numbers in the 500,000 jobs created per month.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The truth is that the economy has not seen job growth like that in nearly 30 years. More to the point, the policies Mr. Romney espouses — notably deregulation and tax cuts for the rich — were the favored policies under President George W. Bush, years when job growth and wage gains were, at best, anemic. And then the economy barreled into the Great Recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More deregulation and high-end tax cuts — along with the deep spending cuts Mr. Romney has endorsed in the House Republican budget — would mean less economic stability, greater inequality and fewer jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama has called for sensible policies that would create more jobs, including infrastructure spending and aid to states to prevent layoffs and boost hiring among teachers and other public employees, but Congressional Republicans have blocked him at every turn. On Friday, Mr. Obama said that he would urge Congress “to take some actions on common-sense ideas” to boost jobs. There is no sign that Republicans are ready to see the light — especially when they see the weak economy as an election-year advantage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The jobless rate dropped in April, from 8.2 percent to 8.1 percent, but the decline was caused by 342,000 people dropping out of the work force. A smaller work force means even slower growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without further government help — especially more aggressive spending to boost demand — the economy simply does not have the momentum to heal itself any time soon. Millions of today’s unemployed and underemployed Americans will pay the price for the rest of their lives, in lost earnings, lost homes and shattered retirement hopes.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once again, a real estate Web site is ruffling feathers by making performance data on individual real estate agents available to the public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last fall, Redfin.com [http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/04/redfin-backs-off-some-agent-home-sales-data/]quickly suspended its Scouting Tool[http://blog.redfin.com/blog/2011/10/requiem_for_a_dream.html] feature, which allowed home buyers and sellers in major markets to search by name for an agent's sales history, after some multiple listing services complained about the site's use of their data and agents questioned the accuracy of Redfin's information. (Multiple listing services track details of property listings and sales for member real estate brokers, who generally pay a fee to participate.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, NeighborCity.com[http://www.neighborcity.com/], a real estate search and referral service based in San Francisco, is facing lawsuits by two regional multiple listing services, alleging that it is violating copyright laws by using their data without permission. The lawsuits were reported recently by Inman News[http://lowes.inman.com/InmanINF/lowes/news/185999], a real estate news service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NeighborCity recently changed its Web site to assign performance scores to real estate agents in markets across the country. The site invites potential home buyers and sellers to search by market and other criteria, like price and property size, and get a list of recommended agents, along with a score that ranks them against their peers.&nbsp; The score is based on various criteria, like the number of properties sold, the number of days the properties spent on the market and the difference between the asking price and the selling price, said Jonathan Cardella, NeighborCity's chief executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cardella said his site had information on roughly 80 percent of real estate agents nationally. The site uses data provided by several sources, he said, including brokers as well as third-party aggregators of publicly available information. The site, he said, aimed to match buyers and sellers with active agents who have had success with similar properties in specific markets. NeighborCity is registered as a brokerage in California, he said, but did not actively broker sales. It gets a fee if an agent makes a sale on a referral from NeighborCity. "No one else is ranking agents this way, providing this level of information," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NeighborCity tried unsuccessfully in the past to license data from multiple listing services, he said, but had to circumvent them by using data from other sources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two regional M.L.S. operators, however -- Metropolitan Regional Information Systems[http://cache.inman.com/files/stories/Doc_1_MRIS_v_AmericanHomeRealtyNetwork_Complaint.pdf], in Rockville, Md., and NorthStar MLS[http://cache.inman.com/files/stories/Doc_1_RMLS_v_AmericanHomeRealtyNetwork_Complaint.pdf] in St. Paul, Minn. -- have filed separate suits in federal court against NeighborCity's parent,&nbsp; American Home Realty Network. A spokesman for MRIS declined to comment on the lawsuit. A representative of NorthStar MLS didn't return a call seeking comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We cannot address ongoing litigation at this time, but can say that brokers do give us permission to use their own listings and apparently the M.L.S.'s are not recognizing our broker agreements, which convey the right to use the listing data available on our Web site," Mr. Cardella said in a follow-up e-mail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're a prospective home buyer or seller, or a real estate agent, take a look at NeighborCity and let us know what you think in the comments section.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reasons not to discount. Vanessa Merit Nornberg says[http://www.inc.com/vanessa-merit-nornberg/why-small-businesses-should-not-discount.html], "Discounts proclaim, in a silent but deadly manner, that what you are selling is worse than, or at best equivalent to, the product of your competitor - and customers are smart enough to know it. Relationships are built on the confidence your customers feel in your products, and the assurance they get from buying what they know to be quality. Discounts wipe out these two brand essentials and leave your business in a very risky position in both customers' minds and the marketplace."</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">New-Home Sales Fell in March, Following a Surge</span>
</div><div class="author">By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS   </div><div>578 words</div><div>25 April 2012</div><div>NYTimes.com Feed</div><div>NYTFEED</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2012. The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes fell sharply in March as the housing market remained under pressure, but the monthly decline appears in part to reflect an upsurge in home buying in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said Tuesday that new-home sales [http://www.esa.doc.gov/sites/default/files/ei/documents/2012/April/newresidentialsales28march201229.pdf]dropped 7.1 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 328,000. February’s figures on new-home sales, however, were revised sharply upward to show a 7.3 percent gain, instead of the 1.6 percent decline that was initially reported. This suggests that warm winter weather might have pulled some sales into February that normally would have occurred in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, new-home sales were 7.5 percent higher in March than they were a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price of a new home was $234,500 in March, down 1 percent from the February price, the Commerce Department reported. That decline is consistent with the trend shown in the Standard &amp; Poor’s/Case-Shiller home price index[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/s/standard_poors_caseshiller_home_price_index/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], also released Tuesday, which showed that prices dropped in February from January in 16 of the 20 cities it tracks. That is the sixth consecutive decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new homes stand at just about half the approximately 700,000-a-year pace that analysts consider evidence of a healthy market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of unsold new homes fell to just 144,000 in March — the fewest on records dating to 1963. The supply has been falling over the last two years as builders have cut back on construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Gapen, an economist at Barclays Research, said the low inventory level should prompt a moderate pickup in housing construction and provide some support to the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the pace of decline in the S.&amp; P./Case-Shiller home-price index has slowed. Some economists said that suggested prices were stabilizing. The index fell 3.5 percent over the 12 months that ended in February. That is the smallest annual drop in a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller index showed that prices rose in Phoenix, San Diego and Miami only. They were unchanged in Dallas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes, meanwhile, rose in January and February, making this winter the best for sales in five years. Such purchases dropped back in March, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.48 million, the National Association of Realtors reported last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders are laying plans to construct more homes in 2012 than at any other point in the last 3.5 years. More jobs and a better outlook among buyers could also make 2012 the first year since 2008 that construction added to the American economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Separately, Americans’ confidence in the economy remained resilient this month despite continuing job cuts and declining home values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conference Board, a private research group, said Tuesday that its Consumer Confidence Index[http://www.conference-board.org/press/pressdetail.cfm?pressid=4463] was at 69.2, down slightly from a revised 69.5 in March. Economists were expecting a reading of 70, according to a FactSet poll of analysts. The current level is below February’s 71.6, which was the highest level it had been in about a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer confidence is widely watched because consumer spending accounts for 70 percent of economic activity. The current level is significantly below the 90 reading that indicates a healthy economy. But it is well above its record low of 25.3 in February 2009.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON (Reuters) — Production at the nation’s factories slipped in March for the first time in four months and builders started construction on fewer homes, offering cautionary signals for an economy that appeared to be gaining traction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturing output dropped 0.2 percent, the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> reported Tuesday. The decline dragged on overall industrial production, which was unchanged and fell short of analysts’ expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“It looks pretty bad on the face of it,” said Tom Porcelli, an economist at <span class="companylink">RBC Capital Markets</span> in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Surging exports and efforts by companies to restock their shelves have made economic growth look more solid in recent weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The factory data did little to change that view, but economists said it suggested the recovery had lost a little steam at the close of the first quarter, partly as a result of the European debt crisis[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/european_sovereign_debt_crisis/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], which is weighing on global growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weakness in industrial production “raises the possibility that the recent easing in global demand is starting to take a toll on U.S. manufacturers,” said Paul Dales, an economist at Capital Economics in London.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signs of a slowdown in growth became apparent earlier this month when the Labor Department reported that payrolls grew far less than expected in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Porcelli and others said the factory sector, which has been a major driver of the United States’ recovery from the recession[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/r/recession_and_depression/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], appeared to have enough momentum to continue growing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Auto production, for example, increased 0.6 percent after rising 0.8 percent in February. Also, initial estimates for manufacturing output in February were revised higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Citing these factors, <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> on Tuesday raised its forecast for first-quarter growth in gross domestic product to a 2.6 percent annual rate from 2.5 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report on new home construction also provided mixed signals. Housing starts slipped 5.8 percent in March to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 654,000 units, the Commerce Department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That unwinds some of the incipient recovery seen in recent months in the struggling housing sector. At the same time, the data still suggests housing construction will add to gross domestic product during the first quarter, said Millan Mulraine, a macro strategist at <span class="companylink">TD Securities</span> in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, new permits for home construction surged to their highest level in 3 1/2 years, which could lead to more housing construction in coming months.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MORE than 200 people showed up for an open house at a town house in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, last month, and the crowd, filled with stroller-pushing parents and young children, was so lively that an ice cream truck pulled up to join the happening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house, at 214 Kane Street, went into contract quickly, after the owners sifted through 14 offers, nearly all of them above the $1.875 million asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the West Village a few weeks earlier, more than 300 people lined up on a Sunday afternoon to see a sunny fifth-floor walk-up with two bedrooms, 15-foot ceilings and a $997,500 price tag. Eleven offers later, it went into contract about 20 percent above the list price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though the most recent market reports show Manhattan real estate prices holding steady, as they have for more than two years, other signs indicate that the New York City market may finally be willing to stop flirting with recovery and commit wholeheartedly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To start with, open house traffic for some properties has reached levels not seen even at the height of the market in 2007 and 2008. But buyers haven't just decided to start looking at properties again; they're actually buying. Bidding wars have become more common.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the development front as well, sponsors say the pace of sales has picked up with the warmer weather. The number of new building permits for residential units, which dwindled to a trickle in 2010, has seen an impressive increase. For the first two months of 2010, no residential building permits were issued. For the same period in 2011, permits were issued for 52 units. This January and February, the number increased nearly 800 percent, to 457 units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers also say that banks that had steered clear of construction loans for residential buildings have started to loosen their purse strings, although they are still unlikely to approve loans for condo projects with more than 100 units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you were not cognizant of the underlying state of the American economy and you lived in New York -- in this bird cage we call home -- you would think everything is just rosy,'' said Jeffrey E. Levine, the chairman of Douglaston Development. But given that the federal debt looms large and given that interest rates will eventually rise, he said that ''there's no way of knowing if the recovery is as broad or as deep as we'd like it to be.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel, warned that buyer exuberance could be short-lived. With Wall Street bonuses much smaller than in years past, the surge in buying is not likely to last long, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Also, once we hit summer, we're going to see a lot more distressed properties hitting the market,'' he said. ''Even though Manhattan is not a hotbed of foreclosure, the world around us will be, so there'll be more negativity in the air.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite all this, many brokers are optimistic about a busy spring season. Having grown accustomed to staging open houses for four or five people at best, they are savoring the wave of enthusiasm. The new normal for open house traffic is about 20 visitors, and it seems to extend to all apartment sizes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, age-old maxims still hold, so spaces encumbered by less-than-ideal locations or inflated prices, or places that don't show well, remain unlikely to generate much interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Judith Furgiuele, a vice president of Brown Harris Stevens, said she was stunned late last month when an open house for a $1.625 million three-bedroom listing on the Upper West Side drew about 150 people, even though it had been ''priced very well because the owners had already bought something.'' Several other apartments in the building were holding open houses that day, so she suspects there was some overflow traffic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But at one point,'' she said, ''as we were trying to handle all these people, I said I thought it was the only listing in Manhattan, and one buyer said to me, 'It kind of is.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of new listings coming to market in Manhattan has indeed dropped. For the first three months of 2012, <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span> counted 5,349 new listings, nearly 16 percent fewer than the 6,406 new listings over the same period last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of that drop may be ascribed to the construction slowdown in recent years. Corcoran estimates that the number of new units dropped 47 percent, to 2,700, in the first quarter of this year, from 5,056 for the same period in 2011. Brokers say that certain neighborhoods and types of homes seem to be experiencing the shrinking supply more severely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meryl Blackman, the agent at Halstead Property representing the owners of the Cobble Hill town house that drew 14 offers, said the limited number of single-family town houses available in brownstone Brooklyn had definitely helped prompt the multiple bids.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We had more kids and pregnant moms waiting to get into the open house than I've ever seen,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the offers were above the $1.875 million list price. Ms. Blackman sat down with the owners, James and Ann Raimes, and went through each one, beginning with the lowest bid. She started reading heartfelt letters from prospective buyers explaining why the house was ideal for their young families. ''But I burst into tears at one point and told her to not read any more,'' Ann Raimes said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with limited supply, pent-up demand may also be driving the new activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the financial crisis hit, buyers held back, waiting for the market to hit bottom. More recently, they waited in anticipation of a double-dip recession. ''But now people are realizing that while the economy may not be as strong they want it to be, the big fear of it collapsing has gone by the wayside,'' said Frans Preidel, a vice president of Brown Harris Stevens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage brokers, too, have seen an increase in buyers entering the market. Melissa Cohn, the president of the Manhattan Mortgage Company, said that while the recent uptick in interest rates ''will slow down people who are thinking about refinancing, it helps people who are thinking about buying to get off the fence.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the deals her firm handles are still for refinanced loans, but she said the percentage had dropped to 60 percent from 70, with buyers seeking new loans accounting for the shift.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increased demand is not just at the high end. Doug Perlson, the chief executive of the brokerage RealDirect, said he had observed more activity even in the studio market. He has a client who lost a studio in a bidding war and is now in contract on a second apartment after another bidding war, both at 200 East 27th Street, a postwar building in Kips Bay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These properties typically take several months to sell and usually don't get multiple bids,'' Mr. Perlson said. Many of the buyers he has encountered, he said, ''have decided to buy because their rent has just been raised 10 to 12 percent and the math just doesn't work for them to keep renting anymore.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charlie Homet, an executive vice president of Halstead, said that while open houses are much busier these days, ''not everybody's buying; there's still a little bit of hesitancy to pull the trigger.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was not the case, though, at a listing he had for a West Village two-bedroom that drew more than 300 pairs of eyes at its first open house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Homet shares the listing with Ari Harkov, a Halstead senior vice president who spent most of the open house holding people back, because the 850-square-foot apartment can only hold about 50 people at one time. ''It was like a really fun cocktail party where you wanted to get to the kitchen, but you could only see it from the living room,'' Mr. Harkov said. ''I felt like a bouncer at a nightclub. ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers tried to make offers on the spot, but he asked them to please put them in writing. Several bids came in that night, and the sellers received a total of 11 offers after asking for best-and-final offers. They had a signed contract five days after the open house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Managing the multiple offers was tricky, Mr. Harkov said, ''because it's obviously not 2007, and people were not accustomed to the kind of bidding we had.'' He and Mr. Homet compiled a spreadsheet with all the bids, sorting by price, level of financing, and closing date.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment is now in contract with an all-cash client who is represented by Martine Capdevielle, a vice president of <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>. Ms. Capdevielle said that pricing the apartment just under $1 million had helped create a buzz for the listing, since ''it's impossible to find a two-bedroom two-bath in the West Village for that amount.'' Her buyer, who is from France, is unfazed by the fifth-floor walk-up, she said, and besides ''in New York, it's a give-and-take, you can't have everything.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most buyers in the last two years have been averse to buying property that needed significant renovation, but Dan Critchett, a sales associate at <span class="companylink">Stribling &amp; Associates</span>, said he had seen a distinct shift in buyer behavior.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Critchett represents an Upper West Side apartment first listed in 2010 at $2.287 million and reduced to $1.99 million by late 2011. Nearly 100 people saw the apartment, a Classic 6, in that year, with several offers coming in at the $1.5 million range. ''The market clearly wanted a huge discount for anything that needed work,'' he said. The 1,800-square-foot apartment needs a new kitchen and would require redesigning to become a true three-bedroom, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Mr. Critchett's urging, the owners took the apartment off the market in December, painted it and weeded out some furniture, then relisted it in February at $1.899 million. Two open houses each drew more than 30 people and the offers started to roll in, all of them close to the asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was a very different market,'' Mr. Critchett said. ''This was a new crop of buyers who weren't afraid of renovating and who realized there aren't that many apartments of this size that are in move-in condition.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new sense of urgency has been felt at new developments as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ken Horn, the president of Alchemy Properties, said that open house traffic had picked up at his finished projects, Griffin Court in Hell's Kitchen and Isis Condominium on the Upper East Side. Two projects under construction, one on West 15th Street and one in Cobble Hill, also have waiting lists with about 100 names of prospective buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you roll the clock back one and half years,'' he said, ''you would have no one on a waiting list. No one would even call until the building was up and done.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and other developers said that construction financing, which had all but dried up with the financial crisis, may be starting to flow again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Skyline Developers, which has owned the site on the southeast corner of Third Avenue and 79th for several years, announced last month that it had closed on a $112 million construction loan with <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> and was beginning construction on a 19-story tower with 45 condos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We had been waiting for the right time to move forward,'' said Don Becker, a Skyline executive. The bank made it clear that it was doing such large deals only with established clients, he said. Still, ''we're starting to see banks become more competitive'' and more willing to negotiate on interest rates and other loan terms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, Mr. Levine of Douglaston Development said that most banks would still lend money only to developers with good track records and for projects with 40 to 100 units. ''The days of doing a 600-unit site like the Edge are behind us for the moment,'' he said, referring to Douglaston's condominium tower on the Williamsburg waterfront.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If 422 West 20th Street is any indication, smaller projects in prime locations can be a good bet. Seven hundred people arrived on its opening weekend late last month, and all but 7 of its 36 units were in contract two weeks later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kelly Mack, the president of the Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group, which is overseeing the marketing of the property, said that when she showed up at 8:30 a.m. to help set up for the first open house, about a dozen people were already lined up and waiting for the 11 a.m. opening. ''That was a complete shock,'' she said. ''I didn't see that even at the height of the market.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building was once a dormitory for the General Theological Seminary, and the apartments range from 600-square-foot one-bedrooms, for $670,000, to 1,600-square-foot three-bedrooms for about $2.1 million. ''That covers a very underserved market in that location,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sharon E. Baum, the director of Corcoran's Exclusive Properties Division, said that she, too, had detected a change in the city's real estate attitude.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shortly after <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> collapsed, Ms. Baum traded in the Rolls-Royce that she had used to ferry clients to apartments around town, because while ''people were still wealthy, they felt embarrassed to talk about it.'' Her driver has since been driving a black Mercedes-Benz sedan, which Ms. Baum says is roomy and much easier to park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, any discomfort with luxury brands and ostentatious spending has all but disappeared, she said, because ''people have to get on with their lives.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides, she added, she never did get rid of the rubber floor mats with the double R insignia. ''And we have the Rolls-Royce umbrella in the car,'' she said. ''We didn't totally give it up.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON - "The real estate market in the United States may still be slumping, but its high end is enjoying a remarkable updraft, propelled by money flowing in from all corners of the globe, including from developing countries like Brazil, China and India," writes our colleague Alexei Barrionuevo in his latest real estate piece[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/04/realestate/russians-court-luxury-real-estate-with-record-breaking-sales.html]. "But no group is consistently writing bigger checks than the Russians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Over the past four years, Russians and other citizens of the former Soviet Union have signed contracts to buy more than $1 billion worth of residential real estate in the United States, according to estimates from lawyers and brokers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alexei reports about Dmitry Rybolovlev, who made billions from potash fertilizer, Igor Krutoy, a composer, and Andrei Vavilov, a former deputy finance minister, among others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tsunamis of cash from extremely well-off Russians, as well as billions from Gulf oilmen and their families, have had a tangible impact on the real estate market in London, probably more than in any other city in the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The influx over the past years and decades helped to send the average price of a home in the central London borough of Kensington and Chelsea over £2 million, or more than $3 million, for the first time[http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-03-19/kensington-and-chelsea-home-prices-breach-2-million-pound-mark.html] - while Britain is battling austerity, a downturn and falling wages and benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While foreign money has poured into London, rich Brits have made a net migration. And even though West Europeans (increasingly those from Greece and the south) are the largest foreign buyers overall in London, the biggest buyers by far in the chic districts of central London - Kensington and Chelsea but also Mayfair, Knightsbridge, Notting Hill, etc. - are East European.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In central London, the biggest investors have been from Eastern Europe, including oligarchs, with 15 percent of the market and an average purchase price of £6.2m," wrote The Telegraph[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/constructionandproperty/8569350/Londons-rich-sell-as-foreign-money-pours-in.html] last summer, quoting a Savills real estate firm report on 2007 to 2011 sales. "Middle East and North African buyers account for 14 percent and spend £4m. The average spend of British buyers is £1.5m."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average Brit can't afford to live in London, least of all the plush provinces of the city. Hour-long commutes, or more, from the hinterlands to work in the capital are not uncommon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Will New Yorkers suffer the same fate, with even the plutocrats and the 1 percent unable to afford the Big Apple? (Though it is hard to imagine a Manhattan where few Americans live, and that such a situation would not prompt a 1776-style revolution.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But money from foreign mega-millionaires and billionaires may have less impact on the Manhattan real estate market than it has had on prices in central London.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alexei's article notes that ultrawealthy Russians are spreading money liberally in real estate markets in New York City, Miami, Los Angeles, Palm Beach, etc. That geographic diversity means less concentration on any one market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">London is a different story. There are simply fewer choices in England for a magnate to buy real estate. Where ya gonna go? Manchester[http://www.visitmanchester.com/]?</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Can a smartphone give you an edge in the competition for that great new house on the market?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If it’s outfitted with the proper software, absolutely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not only can mobile software help home buyers select the right house more quickly than tech-free buyers, it can also help people make smarter bidding decisions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two deep-pocketed Internet companies, Trulia and Zillow, released mobile software years ago intended to help buyers find and research available homes, among other features.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both companies’ apps are free on Android[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/a/android/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and Apple, and both have improved significantly over the years, to the point where their competition helped the mobile real estate category achieve a level of sophistication lacking in many other parts of the app market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But an upstart competitor, House Hunter[http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/house-hunter/id445304335?mt=8], for $4, with a free, more limited Lite version[http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/house-hunter-lite/id457785750?mt=8] is also worth considering, though so far available only on Apple. It’s a good choice for anyone serious about buying because it can help users evaluate multiple houses more easily.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home buyers who are armed with nothing but a legal pad can track a fair amount of data, like size, location and the year of the last kitchen update, but it’s harder to thoughtfully assess and record multiple elements while on a walk-through, or while driving to the next house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House Hunter enforces that sort of discipline by offering a detailed list of roughly 80 house features, along with an easy method for scoring each. It also lets homeowners add their own features to that list, in case an indoor pool or a backyard Jacuzzi is a priority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You then rank each feature’s importance, on a scale from 1 to 10. After a house visit, you evaluate those features individually and the app assigns an overall score to the home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Your comments and photos can be stored inside the app. House Hunter includes a mortgage calculator, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Users can e-mail their ratings to a real estate agent or a family member, for instance. But even if your spouse’s phone also has the app, there is no way for him or her to import your ratings from a solo home visit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the full version of House Hunter is worth the $4 expense, most people will find the free version useful only to glimpse the full app’s features. If amenities like a garage or a front yard are a priority, for instance, the free version won’t be enough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House Hunter comes into play only after you have a set of homes to consider. Before that, Zillow Real Estate and Trulia Real Estate are still the best apps to consider. But because no centralized service has perfect visibility into local real estate markets, it makes sense to download both.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zillow, more fully featured than Trulia, is the best place to start. It is best known as the online service that assesses the value of virtually every home in a neighborhood, but in recent years it has also delved into real estate listings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Users can go through a neighborhood and view the selling prices of local homes for sale, as well as rentals, and prices of homes that recently sold. If you like a home, and you have the iPad[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/i/ipad/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] version of the app, you can save it by dragging it into a favorites section.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The notifications are intelligently designed, offering alerts when prices drop to a specified level or when homes are sold, among others. And if you covet a particular home that’s not currently for sale, the app will alert you if it ever goes on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zillow users[http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/zillow-real-estate-homes-apartments/id310738695?mt=8] can draw a line on a map — Trulia does not offer it — and search for only those houses that are available in a given neighborhood. For buyers who have finely tuned ideas of where they want to live, this is a helpful touch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zillow[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zillow.android.zillowmap&amp;feature=search_result] also offers a section for finding local mortgage rates, and mortgage calculators. The calculators allow you to tweak your down payment, purchase price and interest rate information, and quickly figure monthly payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mortgage rate finder is helpful, too, but only as a guide to local market rates. Financial planners and mortgage professionals generally caution homeowners to seek firm quotes from several lenders or brokers before starting the home-shopping process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trulia doesn’t provide property assessments, and some real estate agents will argue that it’s just as well, since Zillow’s estimates are not always in line with the local market realities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Trulia includes[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.trulia.android&amp;feature=search_result] a well-designed search feature, where users can find homes for sale or rent according to a specified price and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, or homes that have recently posted price reductions, for instance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trulia users[http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/trulia-real-estate-homes-for/id288487321] can also contact a home’s real estate agent from each listing, and scan a list of nearby amenities and institutions, like gas stations or schools.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither Trulia nor Zillow has foolproof listings. In recent tests, both services occasionally turned up listings that were stale, and failed to find others that had recently appeared on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In that respect, the apps are sort of like real estate agents — generally helpful, never perfect and sometimes the critical element in discovering one’s ideal home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quick Calls</p>

</div><div class="author">By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS   </div><div>520 words</div><div>28 March 2012</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2012 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices fell in January for a fifth straight month in most major cities, a new report disclosed Tuesday, but another report said Americans maintained a positive outlook on the nation's economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing data, the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller home price index, showed that prices dropped in January compared with December in 16 of 19 cities tracked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The steepest declines were in San Francisco, Atlanta and Portland, Ore. Prices increased in Miami, Phoenix and Washington. The declines partly reflect typical offseason sales. The month-over-month data is not adjusted for seasonal factors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices fell in 17 of the 20 cities in January compared with January 2011 (when one fewer city was tracked). The group's nationwide index of prices has fallen 34 percent since the housing bust and is now at 2002 levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The continued drop in prices suggested the housing market remained weak, even after the best winter for home sales in five years and steady improvement in the job market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eight cities: Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, Las Vegas, New York, Seattle, Portland, Ore., and Tampa, Fla., are now back at 2000 levels or earlier. Only Denver, Detroit and Phoenix posted year-over-year increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts noted that prices were expected to rise modestly throughout much of 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's going to be tempting to look at home price declines and see a still-faltering housing recovery, but that's just not the case,'' said Stan Humphries, chief economist for the housing Web site <span class="companylink">Zillow.com</span>. ''The reality is that home prices and home sales will be moving'' higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another report released Tuesday, the Conference Board's consumer confidence index edged down in March after hitting the highest level in a year in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet Americans remained upbeat over all in March despite mixed economic signs. The stock market is up, but so are gas prices. Unemployment is falling, but home prices are declining.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board's consumer research center, said consumers ''feel the economy is not losing momentum.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conference Board, a private research group, said Tuesday that its Consumer Confidence Index fell slightly to 70.2 from a revised 71.6 in February, the highest level it has been since the same month in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer confidence has made a recovery since it fell to its low of 25.3 in February 2009. But the March reading is below the 90 reading that indicates a healthy economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index has not been near 90 since December 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists watch consumer confidence closely because spending on everything from clothing to health care accounts for about 70 percent of the nation's economic activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One gauge of the Consumer Confidence index, which measures how shoppers feel now about the economy, rose to 51, from 46.4 in the previous month. That measure now stands at the highest level in more than three years. But the other barometer, which assesses shoppers' six-month outlook, declined to 83 from 88.4 in February.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON (Reuters) — Contracts to purchase previously owned homes fell in February, the National Association of Realtors[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/national_association_of_realtors/index.html?inline=nyt-org] said on Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The association said its Pending Home Sales Index for the month slipped 0.5 percent to 96.5, rather than rising 1 percent as expected by economists surveyed by Reuters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The actual existing-home sales numbers still need to rise a bit in order fully to catch up, but the overall impression is one of a pause,” said Ian C. Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contracts signed were up 9.2 percent in the 12 months to February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data last week showed sales of previously owned homes fell in February, but remained the second-highest since May 2010. Other reports last week also showed declines in home building activity and new-home sales in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, permits to build homes approached their highest level in about three years in February, and prices of both new and previously owned homes rose from a year ago. Some economists said the unseasonably mild winter weather had declined as a favorable factor in the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We are seeing a diminishing lift from the weather. Even if you look at the February setback in most of these indicators, the direction is clearly still upwards,” said Michael R. Englund, chief economist at Action economics in Boulder, Colo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We continue to think we hit the bottom in the housing sector about the middle of last year and that we are recovering,” he added, “though it is a slow recovery and prices are not going to recover until next year.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market remains hobbled by an oversupply of unsold homes, particularly foreclosures, which are pushing down prices. Stringent conditions to qualify for a home loan are also an obstacle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About a third of contracts are canceled every month, according to the Realtors association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Indeed, February has been a bit of a pothole for the housing market. But with affordability high and job creation improving, there is still much opportunity for improvement in the housing sector,” said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contracts fell in three of the four regions last month, but jumped 6.5 percent in the Midwest.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON (AP) — Sales of new homes fell in February for the second consecutive month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said Friday that new-home sales dropped 1.6 percent last month, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 313,000 homes. Sales have fallen nearly 7 percent since December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While a mild winter and three months of strong job growth have lifted resales, those conditions have not helped the new-home market. The current pace is less than half the 700,000 that economists consider to be healthy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists cautioned that the housing market was a long way from fully recovering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Despite renewed hopes over the turn of the year for an imminent turn in housing, it appears that it is too early for such optimism to translate into a rapid pickup in real activity,” said Yelena Shulyatyeva, an analyst at <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were some positive signs in the report. The government revised December’s sales figures up to show an annual rate of 336,000, the best sales pace in a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the median sales price for new homes surged in February more than 8 percent, to $233,700. That is the highest median price since June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just 150,000 new homes were for sale in the United States in January and February — the lowest number in records that date back to 1963. The supply of new homes on the market has consistently fallen over the last two years, which could help stabilize prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jennifer Lee, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, said the price increase may have been “an indication of home builders’ growing confidence in their sector.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders are growing more confident after seeing an increasing number of people express interest in buying this year. They have responded by requesting the most permits to build single-family homes and apartments since October 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously occupied homes have risen more than 13 percent since July. And January and February made up the best winter for resales in five years, when the housing crisis began.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A crucial reason for the dismal sales in the new-home market is that builders must compete with foreclosures[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/f/foreclosures/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and short sales — when lenders accept less for a house than what is owed on the mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales were mixed across the country. They fell 2.4 percent in the Midwest and 7.2 percent in the South. They rose 8 percent in the West and 14.3 percent in the Northeast.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a bullish report on housing at a late summer investment conference in Dallas, the officials at Federated Investors decided to sink a few million dollars into the shares of the home builder Lennar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Philip J. Orlando, Federated’s chief equities market strategist, was hoping for a return of 20 percent to 30 percent, confident in an improving jobs market and upticks in housing construction and sales data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like many other stocks in the home building industry, Lennar surged, nearly doubling in price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builder stocks are at their highest level in two years, with the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor’s</span> index of 11 home builder stocks rising 80 percent since October, the most recent low for the industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors looking to ride the wave from the last six months, however, may be too late. Home builder shares typically increase before the spring and summer home-selling season. And while housing reports have shown some improvement in recent months, data this week has been mixed. A report on Wednesday showed that the sales of existing homes declined slightly in February, while median sales prices rose for the first time in more than a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If you were looking for a home run kind of move, you needed to have bought when the stocks were significantly undervalued six months ago,” Mr. Orlando said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“But we are starting to see fundamental improvement,” he said. “So you may have a situation where instead of stocks falling, maybe they drift sideways. We are not looking for a collapse. We are just not looking for a move up.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federated and other investors are betting that in 2012, the housing market will emerge from its doldrums. Government and industry data on housing have generally shown improvement for several months, although that may vary regionally. Prices are still depressed, but sales and permits to start new construction have picked up, though they are not near their peaks of 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, the National Association of Home Builders said that its housing market index, which measures the outlook for home builders, held steady at 28 in March from the same level in February, its highest level in five years. While still far below the 70s it reached in 2005 during the housing boom, the index has doubled in the last six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, economic data showed that builders requested 5.1 percent more permits in February but broke ground on fewer units. On Wednesday, a report from the National Association of Realtors said that sales of previously owned homes declined 0.9 percent in February from January but that they were still at their second-highest level in 21 months. The median sales price for an existing home rose 0.3 percent to $156,600 in February, compared with a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Diane Swonk, the chief economist for <span class="companylink">Mesirow Financial</span>, said in a research commentary that pent-up demand for housing was clearly rising but that problems obtaining mortgages were limiting a recovery and would push more potential buyers into renting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Over all, it shows the housing market is improving, but still it is depressed,” said Patrick Newport, an economist with IHS Global Insight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the biggest problems hanging over the market is the glut of foreclosed properties, which has pushed down prices of new and existing homes. For the home builders, the question is how much the backlog will damp demand for new homes. High unemployment and stricter lending standards are also limiting sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent rise in shares is “one of the biggest moves in the last few years,” said Joel Locker, a home builders analyst with FBN Securities. “But it has always been a sentiment-driven sector, and fundamentals change at a turtle pace. You might have started to turn the battleship around, but it takes a while.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builder shares lost half their value when the housing market crumbled in 2007 and dropped further during the financial crisis of 2008-9. All last week and through Wednesday, the S.&amp; P. home builder index closed higher than 300 for the first time since March 2009, though it is still far from its peak of over 600 in early 2007. The gains have outperformed the stock market’s overall broad measure, the S.&amp; P. 500, which has risen 27 percent since the beginning of October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The companies whose share prices are performing best this year tend to be those that in 2011 were viewed by investors as having excess debt or weaker profit margins and that now have the most to gain from an improved housing market, said Adam Rudiger, a senior analyst at <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo Securities</span>. The underperforming companies, on the other hand, generally have stronger balance sheets, or higher levels of cash and less debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Hovnanian Enterprises</span>’s shares rose from $1.03 in early October to $2.83 on Wednesday. The home builder, which posted a loss of about $18 million in the first quarter, has slashed its work force, bought land for future housing development and reduced its debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company reported increases in contracts in recent months and a good start to the spring season. But it is too soon to say whether the housing market is rebounding, said J. Larry Sorsby, the chief financial officer for Hovnanian, which is based in Red Bank, N.J.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The jury is still out,” Mr. Sorsby said. “I don’t think anyone can say for sure, but we remain cautiously optimistic.”</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atlanta</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHEN I bought a home out of foreclosure[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/f/foreclosures/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] in 2009, it took over 1,000 hours from beginning to end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I visited properties, looked up county tax records and considered neighborhoods while researching comparable home values. I assembled a team that included two tenacious real estate professionals; a first-rate contractor; a mortgage[http://topics.nytimes.com/your-money/loans/mortgages/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] broker to help navigate the tangle of <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Administration</span>, <span class="companylink">Internal Revenue Service</span> and city and county regulations; as well as my parents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To anyone driving by, my home is a modest bungalow in Edgewood, a working-class neighborhood about two miles east of downtown Atlanta. To me, it is a labor of love in a community I consider my adopted home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I wasn’t sure what it would mean to a banker, though. Three months ago, I decided to try to refinance my mortgage, knowing that the current record-breaking low interest rates would not last forever, and that they represented the best opportunity in more than a generation to finance a home. To get approval, I had to have an appraisal of $135,000 or higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales activity had been brisk, so I felt confident in my home’s value. But I had also received enough alarming alerts from <span class="companylink">Zillow.com</span>, the real estate tracking Web site, to justify my concern. My monthly e-mailed “Zestimate” from Zillow dropped 4 percent, then 8 percent, then in just one month a heart-stopping 25 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Jan. 6, the envelope arrived from <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>. As I held my breath and opened it, I realized that the letter was a verdict of sorts. The bank was rendering judgment not just on the economic value of my time and investment[http://topics.nytimes.com/your-money/investments/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] but on whether I had done my part to help the neighborhood recover, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Edgewood was built to help meet growing housing demands among the working class in the early 1900s. After World War II[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/w/world_war_ii_/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], the middle class fled for the suburbs and the neighborhood faced a period of economic malaise. But by the 1980s homes in Atlanta neighborhoods had begun a slow process of regaining value — and the more controversial processes of gentrification, which can raise a neighborhood’s property values but also displace lower-income residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Edgewood has trailed somewhat behind its neighbors in this regard, which was probably one reason I was able to obtain this particular house. But it seems to be next in line. A large shopping complex with a mix of big-box retailers, restaurants and high-end boutiques that opened in 2003 was an early sign of the Edgewood renaissance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economic crisis, however, was a major setback for the neighborhood’s development. According to Trulia[http://www.trulia.com/], another real estate tracking Web site, the median sales price in Edgewood, which was $101,698 in the first quarter of 2012, has dropped 20 percent since last year (and 37 percent since five years ago).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In my county, DeKalb, there were over 10,000 new foreclosure filings in 2011, according to the <span class="companylink">Atlanta Regional Commission</span>’s report on foreclosures, to say nothing of homes sitting empty because they are in limbo with the banks[http://topics.nytimes.com/your-money/investments/brokerage-and-bank-accounts/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] or because investors abandoned them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2009, I decided to take my shot at buying a home, knowing that the low prices left following the housing bubble might be the only chance I would ever have at homeownership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite my considerable student loans[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/s/student_loans/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and lack of cash, I thought that a mix of down-payment assistance programs, a generous first-time home buyers tax credit and an F.H.A. loan[http://topics.nytimes.com/your-money/loans/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] might give me the opportunity to realize an American dream that just two years previously I was sure would never be for me.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But despite the many down-payment programs I was eligible for, each step of the way was fraught with obstacles. Many of the cheapest homes were not eligible, often for problems that could under any other circumstances be readily resolved, like a lack of kitchen appliances or a single broken window. (F.H.A. has strict requirements regarding the state of a home.) Some beautiful houses were available at extremely low cost but needed extensive renovation, which also disqualified them from the down-payment programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It also became clear early on that the banks would seriously consider only cash offers, and nearly all the homes I was considering were owned by banks. To make my purchase possible, my parents, who are not wealthy, offered to front the cash using money from their retirement[http://topics.nytimes.com/your-money/retirement/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] accounts, with the understanding that I would buy the house back from them for the full amount once the necessary renovations were made.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It worked. Our offer was accepted in August 2009. My contractor kept to our strict timeline, and I moved in on Oct. 31, while workers were still installing the kitchen sink. By February 2010, I had bought it back from my parents for the total cost of the original purchase and the repairs, borrowing $100,000 to do it. This left a 15 percent equity “gift” to cover my down payment on the loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October 2010, The New York Times ran an article[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/30/your-money/30money.html] describing my adventures, and after it ran, some readers voiced concerns. Some people said that my decisions were precisely the kind that led to the housing crash. After all, given the ubiquitous threat of unemployment, homeownership was too risky for most people, let alone for someone like me who could afford only the cheapest of properties and smallest down payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But to me, my long-term risk in buying a house was low. Losing my job as a senior program officer at a nonprofit would be equally harrowing whether renting or owning, and besides, I was reducing my monthly outlays from when I had been a renter, to roughly $800 from about $900.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From a purely financial perspective, however, only the bank’s opinion of me and my work on the house mattered. And in January, when I opened the appraisal envelope, the bank offered its affirmation. My new appraisal came in at $150,000. When I had applied for the $100,000 loan, I received appraisals of $130,000 and $145,000. Seeing that my home’s value had gone up as much as 15 percent in the eyes of my appraiser was splendid news.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based on this new appraisal, I refinanced into a 20-year fixed-rate loan at 3.875 percent. This took eight years and 1.375 percentage points off my original loan. I’ll be saving around $100 a month in mortgage payments and fees and around $56,000 in interest over the life of the loan. But if I continue to pay more than the minimum payment, I will very likely have my home paid off in about 14 years, which will save me an additional $23,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My neighborhood still has its challenges. But with interest rates low (and rents high), home-buying is once again a bargain for many. Each week, I see young couples snapping up little bungalows in my area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the economic comeback, many experts say they believe that the recovery of the housing market is necessary to the recovery of the overall economy[http://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/other-reports/files/housing-white-paper-20120104.pdf]. And now I know that I’ve done my part. Rehabilitating an empty home is good for the community; it improves home values for everyone on my street. So I don’t see buying a foreclosed home as taking advantage of others’ misfortune or making risky decisions that will contribute to the next crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quite the contrary: as the employment situation improves, young adults will have the opportunity to make the same move that I did and we will play significant roles in stimulating further economic recovery. I hope we will be able to do it with less personal debt and more savings, which will lead to greater overall stability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Remembering how certain I was just three years ago that the American dream had drifted out of reach, it feels remarkable to look around at my little home, my growing equity, my affordable cost of living and my lovely neighbors, some of whom have lived here for nearly 70 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sure, I haven’t forgotten the guts it took for my parents to do what they did, nor the hundreds of hours of manual labor I poured into every corner of my home. Still, it’s hard to imagine a more favorable market for young Americans and middle-class families to try to do what I did.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks showed little change on Wednesday as losses in the energy services sector weighed on the market, but gains in technology shares buoyed the Nasdaq and helped keep the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index near four-year highs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S.&amp; P. 500, up 11.6 percent so far this quarter, found buyers at the 1,400 level, which has been held for five straight days. Support at that level could suggest more gains in coming weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The technology sector rose again. The Nasdaq 100-stock technology index is up 0.4 percent for the day and up close to 18 percent this year. It helped the broader Nasdaq composite index edge up for the day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What we're seeing is a rolling correction. Different industry groups are correcting while others are showing strength,'' said Paul Nolte, managing director at <span class="companylink">Dearborn Partners</span> in Chicago. ''Equity markets are being held up in general by the technology group.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A string of upbeat economic data in recent weeks has fueled the market's surge, and pullbacks have been brief. Since a three-day decline two weeks ago, the S.&amp; P. 500 has not lost more than 0.3 percent in one session.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The PHLX Oil Services index fell 1.9 percent after <span class="companylink">Baker Hughes</span> said it expected first-quarter profit margins to fall sharply. Its stock fell 5.8 percent to $45.04, its lowest close since mid-December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S.&amp; P. 500 energy sector index was off 1 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a report on Wednesday, <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> argued that the prospects for future returns in equities relative to bonds were as good as they had been in a generation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Given current valuations, we think it's time to say a 'long goodbye' to bonds, and embrace the 'long good buy' for equities as we expect them to embark on an upward trend over the next few years,'' <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bond market, however, rallied on Wednesday after last week's sharp sell-off. The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 19/32, to 97 13/32, while its yield dropped to 2.30 percent from 2.36 percent late Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones industrial average fell 45.57 points, or 0.35 percent, to 13,124.62 at the close. The S.&amp; P. 500 dipped 2.63 points, or 0.19 percent, to 1,402.89. The Nasdaq composite index edged up 1.17 points, or 0.04 percent, to 3,075.32.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Advancing issues were almost evenly matched with decliners on both the Big Board and the Nasdaq.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of <span class="companylink">Hewlett-Packard</span>, a Dow component, fell 2.2 percent, to $23.46, after it said it was merging its printer and PC businesses in a reorganization to cut costs and increase growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Oracle</span>'s shares fell 2.3 percent to $29.41 after earlier climbing to a session high at $31.15. The world's No. 3 software maker beat Wall Street's earnings estimates late Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nasdaq got a lift from <span class="companylink">Green Mountain Coffee Roasters</span>, whose shares shot up 10 percent to $55.79 after the company said it would carry <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span>-branded coffee in packs designed for its new line of brewers, increasing its efforts to protect its lead in the single-cup coffee market in the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier, data showed home sales fell in February, but upward revisions to January's pace and the first yearly increase in prices in 15 months suggested the recovery in the housing market remained on track.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An index of housing stocks rose 0.5 percent and is up 26.6 percent so far this quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stock market's recovery started last October as investors saw ways to avoid a dire situation in the European debt crisis that threatened the global economic recovery. But analysts see a shift in investor sentiment that could translate into more market gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We believe that the bull market is transitioning from an advance based on crisis resolution toward one driven by expanding risk appetite stemming from mounting evidence of a more durable, self-sustaining economic expansion,'' said Carmine Grigoli, chief investment strategist at Mizuho Securities U.S.A., in a note to clients.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales fell in February, the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday, but upward revisions to the previous month’s rate and the first yearly increase in prices in 15 months suggested the housing market recovery remained on track.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The association said existing home sales slipped 0.9 percent to an annual rate of 4.59 million units last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, last month’s sales rate was the second highest since May 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some economists said smoothing out the data to account for the extra day in February might have contributed to the surprise drop in sales last month. Economists polled by Reuters had expected sales to rise to a rate of 4.62 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We compared the February 2012 seasonal adjustment factor to past leap years, and it appears that the seasonal adjustment was fairly aggressive,” said Ellen Zentner, an economist at Nomura Securities in New York. “Using last year’s seasonal adjustment factor instead of this leap year’s, existing-home sales would have actually risen by 3 percent month on month, to 4.77 million units.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the drop in sales, the report added to signs of a tentative recovery in the housing market, with the median home price rising 0.3 percent from a year earlier, to $156,600 — the first yearly increase since November 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since hitting a bottom of about 4.05 million units in July, home resales have largely held up. Compared with February last year, sales were up 8.8 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A <span class="companylink">JPMorgan</span> economist, Daniel Silver, said the gains were tracking a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 30 percent so far this quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The unusually mild winter may have helped boost existing-home sales in recent months, but we do not think this is the only factor driving up sales,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales last month were mixed, declining sharply in the Northeast and West while rising in the Midwest and South.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other data released on Wednesday showed that demand for home loans fell last week as mortgage rates surged. Fixed 30-year mortgage rates rose to 4.19 percent last week, from 4.06 percent.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON (Reuters) — Permits for home building neared a three-and-a-half-year high in February, the Commerce Department said Tuesday, suggesting a budding recovery in the housing market was still on track although groundbreaking activity slipped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New building permits surged 5.1 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 717,000 units last month, the highest since October 2008, the agency said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase, which exceeded economists’ expectations of a rate of 690,000 units, reinforced views that the housing market was improving and that home building would add to economic growth this year for the first time since 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The data provides further evidence of a rebound in housing activity,” said Eric Green, chief economist at <span class="companylink">TD Securities</span> in New York. “Housing is being nursed back to health, but getting out of rehab takes time.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While signs of progress are emerging in the housing market, an oversupply of unsold homes is depressing prices, and starts are still less than a third of the 2.27 million rate peak reached in January 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In February, housing starts slipped 1.1 percent to a rate of 698,000 units, but there was more new construction activity in January than previously reported. Moreover, starts last month rose 34.7 percent from February last year, the biggest year-to-year increase since April 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of single-family dwellings, the largest share of the market, dropped 9.9 percent last month, but groundbreaking for multifamily housing projects soared 21.1 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the last year, starts on single-family homes have risen 17.8 percent, while multifamily starts have nearly doubled as demand for rental properties has increased, with many Americans moving away from homeownership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Permits last month were helped by a 4.9 percent rise in approvals for single-family dwelling projects to their highest level since April 2010. It was the fifth consecutive month that building permits in the category increased.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PATERSON, N.J. -- At the height of the housing boom, a luxury development arose here that was carved out of a 19th-century brick-and-brownstone factory building, with 14-foot ceilings, oversize windows and granite countertops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like many similar condominium projects, this one collapsed with the recession. But the damage rippled far beyond this historic city because of the project's main financial backer: one of the most illustrious nonprofit housing groups in the nation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group, the Community Preservation Corporation, which for decades has played a pivotal role in reviving downtrodden neighborhoods across New York City, has teetered at the brink of collapse in recent months after it strayed far from its traditional mission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Community Preservation, established in 1974 at the initiative of the banker David Rockefeller, had long used capital that it raised from scores of commercial banks to finance the creation or rehabilitation of rent-regulated, multifamily apartments for the poor and working class. But during the boom, it was instead pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into condo projects and a large-scale development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It did so, in part, through an unusual for-profit arm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group's problems suggest how the siren song of the explosive real estate market in the middle of the last decade seemed to warp the priorities of even stalwart nonprofit housing providers. ''C.P.C. was tempted into more speculative lending, which harmed the organization financially and left a big hole in the field of lending for multifamily housing,'' said Brad Lander, a Brooklyn Democrat and housing expert who is on the City Council. ''Two-thirds of the city's housing stock are rental units, and that's why we need C.P.C. to return to its core mission.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The investments were spearheaded by Community Preservation's longtime leader, Michael D. Lappin, whose salary and bonuses rose to $1.1 million as he pushed the group into riskier ventures. Some were financed by Community Preservation, others by its for-profit spinoff, which paid part of Mr. Lappin's salary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time, Community Preservation defended the ventures, saying it needed to invest in condominiums and other relatively upscale developments in order to strengthen neighborhoods by creating mixed-income communities. But others pointed out that even if that had been the case, the group should not have allocated so much of its capital to such projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the peak of the real estate boom in 2007 and 2008, more than half of the $1.5 billion in loans originated by Community Preservation or its for-profit arm were for condos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lappin established the for-profit arm in the 1990s to allow Community Preservation to invest directly in projects, rather than just lend money for them. The profits were supposed to be directed back into the pool of money that the group lent. But during the housing boom, the for-profit arm, C.P.C. Resources, took on an increasingly important role in Community Preservation's affairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2004, C.P.C. Resources bought an 11-acre parcel on the Brooklyn waterfront where a Domino sugar refinery once stood. The $1.4 billion project was supposed to convert the refinery into 2,200 apartments, a mix of luxury and subsidized units. But it repeatedly ran into delays before obtaining government approval in 2010. Last month, C.P.C. Resources defaulted on its $125 million New Domino loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Community Preservation also provided a $23 million loan for a luxury condo project called Metroplex on the waterfront in Rockaway, Queens. The 126 apartments had balconies with ocean views, oak floors, Jacuzzis and a gym, but when the project opened, not a single one sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the projects had government subsidies that made them affordable to families earning $90,000 to $140,000 a year. But while there is a constant demand for affordable rental housing in the New York region, the market for even subsidized condos, which can take three years to develop, died with the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late last year, with more than $150 million in loans in default and Community Preservation in crisis, its board and the commercial banks that support it forced Mr. Lappin, 68, into retirement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly two-thirds of the condo loans were delinquent, according to the nonprofit group's records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Community Preservation also closed offices in New Jersey and Connecticut, cut salaries for senior executives by 45 percent and dismissed 40 percent of its staff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, the group just barely averted shutting down by working out an extension of its troubled revolving loan program with 72 lenders, including <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> and Chase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview, Mr. Lappin stood by his decision to shift the group's focus during the housing boom, saying the group needed to consider the needs of middle-class people in order to ensure that neighborhoods were stable. ''In the end, I couldn't be prouder of what's been done,'' he said. ''Everybody makes mistakes over a long career.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Community Preservation's board has hired a new chief executive, Rafael E. Cestero, a former New York housing commissioner, hoping to refocus the organization on rental housing in New York, albeit as a far more modest financier than it was in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lappin had been the guiding force behind Community Preservation for more than 30 years, and was known as a zealous advocate for affordable housing. He created a one-stop shop, providing loans to landlords and nonprofit housing groups, assisting them in obtaining government grants and tax credits, and ensuring that building owners replaced boilers, installed new elevators and fixed leaky roofs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All told, the group financed 147,000 new or rehabilitated apartments in working-class neighborhoods from Washington Heights in Manhattan to Crown Heights in Brooklyn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lappin's supporters suggested that he was being scapegoated for a brutal economic downturn that buffeted homeowners, lenders, developers and nonprofit housing groups alike.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Community Preservation's difficulties and its push into the condo market should not have been a surprise to its board, which is composed of current and former bankers, the supporters said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Executives from many of the lending banks sat on its loan committees. And many of the same lenders who urged Mr. Lappin's ouster had a worse record of bad loans to private developers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Why did this organization get into the cross hairs of the banks when those very banks had much worse problems in their own rights, is a mystery to us,'' said Michael Gecan, a senior organizer with Metro Industrial Areas Foundation and East Brooklyn Congregations, which has long worked with Community Preservation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">D. Kenneth Patton, a former real estate executive and Community Preservation board member, acknowledged the board's role. ''I was a member of the board who encouraged them to go into riskier places,'' Mr. Patton said. ''I was wrong. There was a much higher default rate. New Jersey was the worst.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In any event, no one in the housing world wants to see Community Preservation disappear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City officials and others have pleaded with bank officials who contribute to its loan pool to allow Community Preservation to refocus on affordable rental housing. The officials said they were worried that if Community Preservation was hobbled or closed, buildings in many poor neighborhoods would suffer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group's champions said the hiring of Mr. Cestero, the former housing commissioner, would help to restore confidence in Community Preservation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the group is on a tight leash. Working with state and city officials, Community Preservation recently resumed lending, putting $2.8 million into four buildings in the Morrisania section of the Bronx.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're not looking backward,'' Mr. Cestero said. ''We're moving forward. The affordable housing community has spoken loudly that it needs C.P.C. focused on its core mission.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market has shown signs of life recently. Home sales have beat expectations[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/25/business/economy/home-sales-slip-but-data-show-stronger-quarter.html] and pending sales neared a two-year high[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/28/business/economy/pending-home-sales-in-us-near-a-two-year-high.html]. But prices — the crucial measure of housing-market health — are still falling[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/25/business/homes-arent-selling-but-its-an-apartment-landlords-market.html], driven down by increasing levels of distressed sales of foreclosed properties. That means the market, and the broader economy, which derives much of its strength from housing, are not out of the woods — not by a long shot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For too long, President Obama and his team have relied on the banks to voluntarily modify troubled loans. Those efforts were focused on reducing monthly payments, not principal — a more powerful form of relief.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now President Obama is trying again. On Tuesday, he announced a new policy of easier refinancings[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/03/06/fact-sheet-president-obama-announces-new-steps-provide-housing-relief-ve] for loans that are backed by the Federal Housing Administration. As part of the settlement announced in February[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/10/business/states-negotiate-26-billion-agreement-for-homeowners.html], the major banks will be required to promote loan modifications for troubled borrowers, including principal reductions for underwater homeowners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Obama has also promised a far-reaching investigation into mortgage abuses that is supposed to yield more accountability from the banks and more money for foreclosure prevention. He must deliver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One thing is sure: Waiting for the situation to self-correct, as Mitt Romney has recommended, won’t fix the problem. The recent good news on sales has been driven by pent-up demand and warm winter weather that lured buyers. But more sales won’t translate into higher prices until foreclosures abate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last quarter of 2011, national home prices fell 4 percent, putting prices back to levels last seen in mid-2002, according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor’s</span>/Case-Shiller price index. <span class="companylink">Moody’s</span> Analytics estimates that 3.3 million homes are in or near foreclosure and another 11.5 million underwater homeowners are at risk of foreclosure if the economy or their finances weaken.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is help really on the way?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main component of the administration’s new efforts is the recent foreclosure settlement between the big banks and state and federal officials. In exchange for immunity from government civil lawsuits over most foreclosure abuses, the banks will provide $26 billion worth of relief, including principal write-downs, to an estimated 1.75 million borrowers. That is a pittance compared with the losses in the housing bust. But by preventing a chunk of additional foreclosures, it could help ensure that prices do not fall much further before bottoming out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The settlement was announced nearly a month ago, but the specific terms have yet to be released. One concern is that banks may have leeway to tailor loan modifications in ways that help them clean up their balance sheets, while leaving many homeowners deeply underwater. Another is that states may be able to use money from the settlement for purposes other than foreclosure relief.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The investigation that is supposed to be the powerful follow-up to the settlement has also gotten off to a worryingly slow start. Announced in January by Mr. Obama, it still has no executive director, raising questions about the administration’s commitment to truly holding the banks accountable. The longer it takes to do an investigation, the longer it will take to secure verdicts or settlements that would include money for further antiforeclosure efforts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the banks held off on foreclosure while the settlement was being negotiated, reclosure filings are set to rise in the coming year to more than two million. That means more pain for struggling homeowners — and the economy. By this point, homeowners should be inundated with relief, not still anxiously awaiting help.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What would you do if you were a leading real estate broker during this sluggish, problematic market for American home sales[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/28/business/economy/pending-home-sales-in-us-near-a-two-year-high.html?_r=1]? One such firm plans to accentuate the positive by playing up the emotional reasons for owning a home, now that the rational reasons like making a killing no longer seem relevant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firm is Coldwell Banker Real Estate[http://www.coldwellbanker.com/], which in a campaign that is scheduled to begin on Monday will celebrate what it calls the "Value of a home." The start of the campaign, with a budget estimated at $15 million, is timed with the approach of spring and the start of the home-buying season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this instance, each value cited in the campaign is a warm and fuzzy one, ranging from "the warmth of a winter fire" to "a grandmother kissing her grandchild."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The values are brought to life in a television commercial[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-wlGGsp2Zo&amp;feature=youtu.be] that cranks the emotional dial to 11, or maybe 12. The vignettes, photographed with a gauzy, well-lit look, celebrate "about 50,000 memories and a hundred thousand smiles," which are generated, according to the campaign, by living in a home of one's own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another way the emotional approach is intensified is through the use of the actor Tom Selleck to supply the voice-over narration in the commercial. It is no coincidence that Mr. Selleck is currently playing the paterfamilias of a clan of New York City police officers in the CBS series "Blue Bloods."[http://www.cbs.com/shows/blue_bloods/]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"How to put a value on a home," Mr. Selleck begins, then cites intangibles that include "the smell of pancakes made on a Sunday morning," "the taste of a good cabernet with family at Thanksgiving" and "the power of a bedtime story."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also urges those listening to his voice to "subtract the stress of work" as well as "the struggles of the outside world" when considering "the value of a home."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"<span class="companylink">Coldwell Banker</span>," Mr. Selleck concludes. "Where home begins."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The campaign is created by Siltanen &amp; Partners in El Segundo, Calif., which was selected as the <span class="companylink">Coldwell Banker</span> creative agency in August. Siltanen &amp; Partners replaced McKinney in Durham, N.C., whose last campaign dramatized the pitfalls of selling a home without using a Coldwell Banker agent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People buy homes for lifestyle reasons, for emotional reasons, and it's not always a rational decision," said Michael Fischer, chief marketing officer at <span class="companylink">Coldwell Banker Real Estate</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"But everything out there," he added, in terms of advertising, "is about a rational decision."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There needed to be a better voice, a more positive voice," Mr. Fischer said, that brought up "all the things that make a house a home" like "a large backyard, the outdoor fire pit" and being able to have pets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The upbeat message is aimed not only at potential home buyers, he added, but also at <span class="companylink">Coldwell Banker</span> agents, to remind them of what he termed "that emotional higher kind of calling of their business."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The campaign is not a Pollyanna-like paean to buying a home at all costs, Mr. Fischer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're not running away from" being realistic about the state of the housing market, he added, and the firm says "don't buy a house" to those without sufficient income or plans to stay in a home for a long time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Selleck was chosen for the campaign for "that authentic, trusting, warm voice," Mr. Fischer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There also turned out to be, appropriately enough, a warm and fuzzy connection between the actor and <span class="companylink">Coldwell Banker</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Selleck's father, Robert, "was a vice president for 38 years at <span class="companylink">Coldwell Banker</span>" in Los Angeles, Mr. Fischer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Mr. Selleck's involvement in "Blue Bloods" resonates apart from the part he plays, Mr. Fischer said, because agents of <span class="companylink">Coldwell Banker</span>, which has blue as its corporate color, "will say, 'If you cut me, I bleed blue.'

</div><div class="author">By VICKIE ELMER </div><div>720 words</div><div>4 March 2012</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2012 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">INSIDE the interest rate quoted on your home mortgage lies a small hidden fee that has been charged by government-sponsored entities like <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> for more than three decades. It's an add-on rate known as the guarantee fee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An increase in the fee has been mandated by Congress to occur this spring, and other increases are likely later this year and next. When they happen, interest rates on single-family mortgages resold to <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> or <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> are likely to inch up as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's going to be silently passed through'' by lenders when it does increase, said Richard W. Grohmann, a real estate lawyer in Paramus, N.J.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The G-fee -- as it is known -- does not show up in borrowers' mortgage documents or good-faith estimates, and it is little known outside the industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It gets incorporated into the underlying rate that the borrower pays,'' said Andrew Wilson, a spokesman for Fannie Mae.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An interest rate is usually made up of three parts: the largest goes to the bank or the investors who buy the loan; a smaller portion is for the mortgage servicer that collects monthly payments; and then there's the guarantee fee. Fannie and Freddie charge guarantee fees as a form of insurance against default for the loans they acquire and resell to investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The G-fee will rise 10 basis points on April 1; the increase was included in the two-month extension of the payroll tax reduction last December. (A basis point is equal to one one-hundredth of 1 percent, or 0.01 percent.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keith T. Gumbinger, a vice president of HSH Associates, a financial publisher in Pompton Plains, N.J., says the increase in the guarantee fee will very likely push up mortgage rates on new loans by one-eighth of a percentage point. ''While it is most common to build the G-fee into the loan's rate, it doesn't have to be done that way,'' he said in an e-mail, noting that some lenders might charge a flat fee instead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already, though, loans with interest-rate locks from the last 45 or 60 days have the higher guarantee fee written into them, according to Tom Kelly, the president of Investors Home Mortgage, a division of Investors Bank in Short Hills, N.J. Lenders say they need the extra lead time because it may take time to close the loan, package it and send it on to Fannie or Freddie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One way to avoid the guarantee fee is to use a lender that does not sell off its loans -- for instance, a community bank or a credit union.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides offsetting risks, the fees provide a primary source of revenue for <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. Fannie, for instance, made $5.6 billion in single-family guarantee-fee income in the first nine months of 2011, a 4.7 percent increase from the 2010 period, according to its quarterly financial statements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fannie and Freddie have collected G-fees since the introduction of mortgage-backed securities in the early 1980s. ''It was variable from the start, based on the volume level of loans'' made by the lender, Mr. Kelly said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both organizations started raising fee rates in 2008 during the housing crisis, as foreclosure costs rose. G-fees gained modestly in 2010, and also last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New single-family loans acquired by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> were charged a guarantee fee of 31.1 basis points, on average, in the third quarter of 2011, the most recent period for which data are available.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE quirks of residential layout dictate that any measurement of square footage in a house will be debatable at best, agents and other experts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Assessors, who measure living space as one of many variables in computing home value, follow guidelines set by the state's Department of Taxation and Finance. These guidelines, to take just one example, automatically exclude the basement from any calculation of living space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No matter how spectacularly well remodeled that basement may be -- lavishly enough, perhaps, to increase the assessor's ultimate determination of property value -- its location in the house makes it irrelevant as square footage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This may come as a surprise to buyers relying on real estate Web sites like Zillow and Trulia that make a feature of the ''price-per-square-foot'' calculation. Trulia, especially, considers price per square foot so significant that it highlights it right alongside the number of baths and bedrooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We believe it's great for consumers to have as much data at their fingertips as possible,'' said Ken Shuman, head of communications at Trulia. He called price per square foot ''one of many factors in determining how to price a home, if you're a seller, and something that buyers look at to get a better understanding of whether a house is a good value.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some buyers these days may be inferring too much from the statistic's prominence on the site. Take for example two single-family colonials in New Rochelle, each recently listed for $419,000. In a synopsis of the houses' main features, Trulia notes that one of them, with three bedrooms and one bath, costs $262 per square foot, while the other, with five bedrooms and two and a half baths, costs $206.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, in Larchmont, two houses were recently on the market for $1.195 million: a four-bedroom three-and-a-half-bath Tudor, described as costing $477 a square foot; and a six-bedroom three-and-a-half-bath Victorian, said to cost $324.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Does that mean that the five-bedroom house in New Rochelle and the six-bedroom in Larchmont are better deals? Not necessarily, brokers say. Unmeasured areas like a renovated basement or a garage in-law unit -- or even a superior location -- may account for the higher price the sellers are asking. And that higher price inevitably increases the price per square foot. .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only in large lookalike housing developments -- or in homogeneous neighborhoods like the Highlands in White Plains, where the vast majority of the houses are small prewar colonials and Tudors on similarly sized lots -- is price per square foot a relatively reliable measure of value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Of course, buyers initially gravitate to what on the surface appears to be a better buy,'' said Clayton Jeffrey, the sales manager of <span class="companylink">Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage</span> in New Rochelle. ''But the statistic taken out of context tells only part of the story.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, as a bargaining tool, price per square foot has been getting a lot of play in recent months. Though often employed in commercial real estate, and in less idiosyncratic residential real estate like condominiums and co-ops, it has of late become ''a hot topic in the single-family-home market,'' said Chris Meyers, the chief operating officer of Houlihan Lawrence, who described it as ''a big driver in many buyers' decision-making process.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, some assessors are being besieged by homeowners demanding to know why their price-per-square-foot figures are so high -- why upgrades like their finished basement or the heated and fully furnished family room in what was once a garage have been left out of the equation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is driving me crazy,'' Michele Casandra, Pelham's assessor, said recently from under a growing mound of paperwork. ''Even if I wanted to change something, I couldn't, because we follow state regulations and appraisal guidelines. We don't invent them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Ms. Casandra's opinion, price per square foot should not even apply to single-family homes in the suburbs because there are too many variables involved. ''Maybe in a city when you're dealing with specifically defined living units without basements or attics,'' she said, ''but certainly not somewhere like Pelham with such a variety of homes -- Victorians, colonials, Tudors that weren't meant to have basements used as family rooms.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though fully finished, renovated space increases the value of a house, she said, the rules are written in such a way that it cannot be factored into the square footage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Susan Reddy, a sales agent for McClellan Sotheby's International Realty in Pelham, cited a colonial that came on the market last year for $1.699 million. The town's records put its square footage at 3,373, not including 380 square feet in a garage that had been converted to a media room with high-end finishes and heating and air conditioning, or 816 square feet in a basement that had been similarly finished and had windows and a sliding glass door leading to the yard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People only looked at what the town's records showed for price per square foot and rejected it out of hand,'' Ms. Reddy said. The house has since been taken off the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The square footage of raised ranches and splits is closer to actuality. Because they were designed to employ below-grade space as living quarters, the state formula allows such space to be factored into total square footage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The emphasis on square footage is placing the onus on brokers to explain to both buyers and sellers its actual significance in understanding value. As Donna McElwee, a sales agent for Houlihan Lawrence in Rye, said: ''Buyers need to be educated. They come armed with data they got from the Internet, but those are just numbers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I tell them that price per square foot taken out of context doesn't mean that much, because you have to really be inside a house, in a sense, to 'feel' the square footage and relate to it personally to see if it fits your family,'' she added. ''You can do a lot on the Internet these days, but you still can't do that.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOME prices in the United States, which seemed to begin to recover in 2009, fell to new lows in 2011, according to the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller index of prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seattle and Atlanta were among the metropolitan areas where prices have fallen the most since the national market seemed to hit bottom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Prices peaked in Seattle after the rest of the United States, so Seattle is a little bit behind in the correction that will bring prices back in line with income levels,'' said David L. Stiff, chief economist of Fiserv, which collects the data and calculates the Case-Shiller indexes. Foreclosures are rising there as they are receding in some areas where problems appeared earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As seen in the accompanying charts, five of the 20 markets tracked by the Case-Shiller indexes peaked in 2007. Four of them -- Seattle; Atlanta; Charlotte, N.C.; and Portland, Ore. -- are down at least 7 percent from the spring of 2009. Only Dallas has held up relatively well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dallas was also a special case during the housing boom; prices there rose more slowly than in any other market except Detroit. One reason for both its slow ascent and subsequent slower fall may be that, because of state laws, refinancing mortgages is harder in Texas. That meant there was less money available to bid up prices in good times, and fewer homes worth less than was owed when the bad times arrived.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Detroit home prices have also done relatively well in recent months. In 2011, prices there rose a small amount, making it the only market to show a gain for the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the markets where speculation was heaviest seem to be recovering. Prices in all three California markets are still higher than they were in the spring of 2009, and prices in Phoenix fell less in 2011 than they did in most markets. But Las Vegas, perhaps the most speculative market during the boom, is still suffering. Prices there have fallen nearly 20 percent since the spring of 2009, more than in any other market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is possible that the home price situation is not as bleak as portrayed by the Case-Shiller indexes. A major challenge for any home price index is assuring comparability. Case-Shiller does that by comparing prices of homes with the price of the same home when it was previously sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The risk is that such comparisons may overlook changes to the home between transactions. During the boom, that meant the index might overstate gains because a home rose in value in part because of the addition of a new bedroom or swimming pool. Now, it may overstate losses because a disproportionate portion of sales in some markets are foreclosures, which are less likely to have been well maintained and in some cases may have been abandoned and vandalized before a new sale takes place. Mr. Stiff said Fiserv tried to minimize that problem by reducing the impact on the index of home sales that appear to show unusually large increases or decreases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another national index, maintained by the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span>, showed a smaller decline in prices in 2011, and says prices hit bottom last February, before rising a little late in the year. That index is based on data from <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, which are regulated by the agency.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lowe's, the home improvement chain, reported higher-than-expected fourth-quarter sales on Monday as a warm winter prompted many homeowners to take up renovation projects that they normally save for the spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lowe's results came just days after data pointed to a budding housing recovery after years of weakness and excited some industry watchers over the prospects of the home-improvement segment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We encourage investors to look past the near term and think about double-digit margins for all when housing recovers,'' said Gary Balter, an analyst at <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signed contracts for home resales rose to a nearly two-year high in January, an industry group said on Monday, further evidence of a recovery in the housing market. The National Association of Realtors said its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed in January, rose 2 percent, to 97 -- the highest reading since April 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of Lowe's rose 18 cents, to $27.34 on Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lowe's is also benefiting from a range of initiatives to win shoppers, including a recent move to shift away from promotions to lower prices all the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The retailer has also started offering more localized products, improved its Web site and tried to enhance the shopping experience by using better signage and technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This also shows a company making progress in its transition,'' said David Strasser, an analyst at Janney Capital Markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company reported that its sales rose 11 percent, to $11.63 billion in the fourth quarter ended on Feb. 3, well ahead of the analysts' average estimate of $11.34 billion, according to Thomson Reuters. Sales at stores open at least a year rose 3.4 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Net income rose to $322 million, or 26 cents a share, from $285 million, or 21 cents a share, in the period a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Excluding special items, the profit was 29 cents a share, beating analysts' estimate of 24 cents, according to Thomson Reuters.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contracts to buy previously owned homes in the United States neared a two-year high in January, an industry group said on Monday, further evidence the housing market was slowly turning the corner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed in January, increased 2 percent to 97 points, the highest reading since April 2010. New contracts generally lead sales by a month or two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing data ranging from home building to resales have been relatively upbeat, buttressing other signs of underlying economic strength that should help the recovery better withstand rising gasoline prices and a recession in the euro zone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market is becoming less of a drag on the economy, and home construction is expected to add to growth this year for the first time since 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Clearly we had better weather conditions in January that might have helped, but we have a situation where we are seeing a number of housing statistics turn,'' said Michael H. Strauss, chief economist at Commonfund in Wilton, Conn. ''It suggests housing is going to be an additive to G.D.P. this year.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">December's index of pending home sales was revised to show a much smaller 1.9 percent drop instead of the previously reported 3.5 percent decline. In January, new contracts were up 8 percent from their year-ago level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in last month's index suggested home resales would increase for a second consecutive month in February, and it also bodes well for the spring sales season.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This spring we expect to see continued forward momentum in the housing market as excess inventory is absorbed and low-cost mortgage debt becomes more prevalent,'' said John Tashjian, principal at Centurion Real Estate Partners in New York. ''A strong spring housing season will be a critical indicator toward predicting growth in the housing market for 2012.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market has been hampered by an oversupply of unsold homes, but the number of both new and previously owned properties for sale has been whittled down in recent months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, with the foreclosure tide yet to recede and continuing to depress prices, recovery will take awhile. A report due on Tuesday is expected to show that prices in 20 metropolitan areas tracked by the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case-Shiller fell by 0.5 percent in December after declining by 0.7 percent in November.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New single-family home sales fell in January, but an upward revision to December's data and a drop in the supply of properties on the market added to growing signs of a budding recovery in the housing sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another report released Friday, a survey reported an uptick in consumer sentiment, surpassing analysts' expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said new-home sales slipped 0.9 percent in January, to a seasonally adjusted 321,000-unit annual rate. December's sales rate was revised up to 324,000 units, the highest in a year, from the previously reported 307,000 units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">October and November sales also were revised higher. Although sales fell last month, they were higher than economists' expectations for a 315,000-unit rate. Compared with January last year, new-home sales were up 3.5 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the weak sales last month, details of the report offered further signs of gains in the housing market, with the months' supply of homes on the market falling to 5.6 months, the lowest since January 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That compared with 5.7 months in December. A six-month supply is generally considered ideal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price for a new home rose 0.3 percent, to $217,100, the highest level since October. Compared with January last year, the median price was down 9.6 percent. The inventory of new homes on the market was the lowest on record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The report shows traction for a housing industry anxious to ascend from the bottom,'' said Mitchell C. Hochberg, principal at Madden Real Estate Ventures in New York. ''To climb back, the foreclosure overhang needs to clear, prospective home buyers must find it less difficult to qualify for a mortgage and consumer confidence must improve.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for housing could be helped by the strengthening economy, especially the labor market, which is helping to lift confidence among Americans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer sentiment improved to a 12-month high in February as Americans became more confident about the economy's resilience, a survey released on Friday showed. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's final reading on the overall index on consumer sentiment edged up to 75.3 in February, from 75.0 in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It surpassed economists' expectations of 73.0 and recovered from a decline to 72.5 in February's preliminary reading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is not that surging oil prices, instability in the Mideast, the European crisis or uncertainties about future tax and spending policies could not ultimately derail the recovery, but that consumers expect the pace of overall economic growth to continue to slowly restore lost jobs despite these potential problems,'' the survey director, Richard Curtin, said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey's barometer of current economic conditions eased to 83.0 from 84.2 but its gauge of consumer expectations rose to its highest in a year, at 70.3 from 69.1.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of people seeking unemployment benefits fell to the lowest point in almost four years last week, the latest signal that the job market was steadily improving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other economic news, a rise in building permits suggested that the construction industry was growing confident that more buyers were ready to come off the sidelines, and the latest data on wholesale prices signaled that inflation remained largely in check. And a survey by the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia</span> found continued expansion in factories in mid-Atlantic states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department said on Thursday that weekly applications for unemployment benefits dropped 13,000 to a seasonally adjusted 348,000. It was the fourth drop in five weeks and the fewest number of claims since March 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The four-week average, which smoothes out fluctuations in the weekly data, fell for the fifth-consecutive week to 365,250. The average has fallen nearly 13 percent in the last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The consistent decline indicates that companies are laying off fewer workers and that hiring is picking up. When applications drop consistently below 375,000, it usually signals that hiring is strong enough to lower the unemployment rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, the economy added a net 243,000 jobs, the most in nine months. And the unemployment rate dropped for the fifth-consecutive month, to 8.3 percent. The economy has added an average of 201,000 jobs a month for the last three months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Faster economic growth is spurring the additional hiring. The economy expanded at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in the final three months of last year, a full percentage point higher than in the previous quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the job market has a long way to go before it fully recovers from the damage of the Great Recession. Nearly 13 million people remain unemployed, and 8.3 percent unemployment is still high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the housing front, the Commerce Department reported on Thursday that construction of single-family homes cooled slightly in January after surging in the final month of 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits, however, increased. Builders broke ground on a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 699,000 homes in January, which is up 1.5 percent from December and nearly matches November's three-year high for starts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction began on 508,000 single-family homes last month, a 1 percent drop from December and the first decline in four months. A big rise in apartment construction helped offset the decline in single-family homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the number of December single-family homes was revised up strongly to show builders had started 513,000 homes, a 12 percent gain from November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And building permits, a gauge of future construction, rose 0.7 percent, a majority of which were for single-family homes. It can take 12 months for a builder to obtain a permit and construct a single-family home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family home construction rose in each of the final three months of last year, bringing the pace of those starts to the highest level since April 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The upturn in permits and starts in recent months has been consistent'' with the surge in the survey of home builders, ''which has surprised the markets to the upside for five straight months,'' said Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics. ''The new home sales numbers have not yet responded, but builders seem confident that if they build, buyers will come.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department also reported on Thursday that the producer price index, a measure of wholesale prices, rose 0.1 percent. Wholesale prices fell by the same amount in December. In the last 12 months, they have increased 4.1 percent, the smallest rise in a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, so-called core prices increased 0.4 percent, the most in six months. Economists said most of the increases were likely to be temporary and not to continue driving the core higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wholesale gas prices rose, but were offset by steep drops in home heating oil, natural gas and electricity, which fell by the most in more than seven years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Philadelphia Fed's survey of economic conditions for February found increases in manufacturing activity, new orders and shipments. Over all, the report's index of manufacturing conditions rose to 10.2 points, up from 7.3 in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The survey of mid-Atlantic businesses also found steady employment levels but an increase in average work hours.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHILE the economy remains stubbornly sluggish and home sales nationwide continue to sag, Manhattan's real estate market has largely stabilized, with apartments in some neighborhoods selling for prices not seen since the headiest days of the boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But on the road to recovery, one segment of the market has outpaced the rest: ultraluxury, which analysts roughly define as properties costing $7 million and up. At these lofty heights, there was only the slightest of hiccups after the crash, and in the ensuing years, values have soared, with some apartments doubling in price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Normally, that news would mean rising prices in every other segment of the market, from the tiniest starter studios to family-size four-bedroom co-ops. But that is not happening, even with interest rates at record lows and prices considered reasonable by Manhattan standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is a greater disconnect between the very top of the market and everything else than I have ever seen in my 25 years in the business,'' said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the reason for this, brokers and analysts say, is that the wealthiest buyers are immune to practical matters like stricter lending standards and shrunken Wall Street bonuses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last three years there has also been a dry spell in new construction, and for those with money to burn, the limited inventory has stoked demand. And with New York now seen as a refuge during uncertain times, international buyers are helping to drive the prices ever higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Most people would say that the top end of the market is bulletproof,'' said Pamela Liebman, the president of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, ''and that buyers at this end don't have the same sensitivities as the rest of the market and their confidence does not wane. There is a reason that Hermes has a waiting list for belts and bags.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Defining ultraluxury is not an exact science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When I started,'' Mr. Miller said, '' 'luxury' meant the building had a doorman. Now, because luxury has become generic, they have had to add the adjective ultra.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Generally, brokers agree that anything priced above $7 million fits the bill. Mr. Miller compared the sales at the top 5 percent of the market -- apartments priced over $6 million -- with those at the bottom 5 percent -- apartments priced below $300,000 -- over the last decade. After adjusting for inflation, he found that the value gap between the most and the least expensive properties has never been wider.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It seems to be part of a wider global phenomenon, where there is an ever greater concentration of wealth at the upper echelons,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many moderately priced properties sold last year for roughly the same price that they brought from 2006 to 2008. Mr. Miller described a one-bedroom at 360 East 72nd Street as typical. The owners paid $770,000 for it in 2006 and sold it last year for $750,000, about a 2 percent loss. Meanwhile, a four-bedroom at 151 East 58th Street, bought in 2005 for $13 million, sold five years later for $17.75 million, a 36 percent profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most expensive apartments constitute only a fraction of the market, but the impact of their rising value is greater than just the eye-popping sums they command. Along with the surge in demand for lavish prewar co-ops, the success of developments like Superior Ink in Greenwich Village, and 15 Central Park West and the Laureate on the Upper West Side, makes it all the more likely that future developers will choose luxury over affordability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 1980s, it was rental high-rises like those dotting the Upper East Side that appealed to developers. While they often offered some good-sized apartments, they were designed to accommodate as many apartments as possible. Operating under a different mindset, developers of those buildings often put fitness centers on the top floor, whereas that space now would be reserved for a penthouse getting top dollar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The condos that have opened in the last few years often have larger apartments and fewer units. They are aimed squarely at the rich, perhaps none more so than the new Extell development at 157th West 57th Street, called One57.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it opens next year, it will be the city's tallest residential building, at 90 stories, and the most expensive, with the cheapest unit reportedly at $7 million. Fewer than 100 residences will be available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York has always had its share of trophy properties, but Ms. Liebman identified the $45 million sale in 2003 of an apartment in the Time Warner Center as the one that ushered prices into the stratosphere. Whereas eight-figure deals were a rarity as recently as five years ago, hardly a week went by last year without a sale over $10 million. The gilt-edged properties were spread across the city, including penthouses in TriBeCa and Union Square, co-ops on the East Side and new condos on the West Side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the banker Sanford I. Weill sold an apartment at 15 Central Park West late last year with an asking price of $88 million -- more than $13,000 per square foot -- real estate executives said the deal signaled another leap in the kinds of prices that are possible. Mr. Weill very likely doubled his 2007 investment of $43,687,751.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The impact was immediate. For instance the reported asking price for the penthouse at One57, first set at $90 million, soon neared $115 million. Still, at $7,000 per square foot, a certain kind of shopper might consider it a bargain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Even if you are spending $40 million, it is comforting to know that there are other people spending that kind of money as well,'' said Kelly Kennedy Mack, the president of the Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group, who has been a consultant to top-selling Manhattan developments including One57. ''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PALO ALTO, Calif. — Imagine looking for a house in San Francisco or one of the nicer parts of Silicon Valley, which are already among the most expensive parts of the country. Now imagine having to bid against a legion of newly minted Facebook[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/facebook_inc/index.html?inline=nyt-org] millionaires.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I’m kind of worried — a thousand millionaires are going to be buying houses!” Connie Cao said as she and her family toured a home in a good school district here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her husband, Jared Oberhaus, was more optimistic. “Maybe sellers are sitting on their houses now, waiting for <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, and they’ll all come on the market at the same time,” he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will be some time before the first <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> shares are sold to the public, and even longer before <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>’s employees are able to turn their paper wealth into cash and officially take their places as the newest members of the 1 percent. But the mere anticipation of the event may pour a little kerosene onto what is already a fairly hot local real estate market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Ken DeLeon, a Silicon Valley real estate agent, recently sold an 8,000-square-foot house to a <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> employee, he said, the movers showed up at the client’s old 1,000-square-foot home and asked, “Did you win the lottery?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Silicon Valley has been good to Mr. DeLeon, a former lawyer, who said he sold $275 million worth of homes last year, and who is finishing up a memoir about overcoming illness, injury and loss that he calls “Why Do Bad Things Happen to Sexy People?”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even after some of the air went out of the housing bubble in the Bay Area in recent years, prices in the most desirable parts of San Francisco and Silicon Valley stayed buoyant enough to remain out of reach for most people. A report[http://hlr.coldwellbanker.com/Index.html] on 2011 housing prices by Coldwell Banker, the real estate company, found that 8 of the nation’s 20 most expensive markets were in Silicon Valley or the Bay Area. Mr. DeLeon said Palo Alto, with its limited supply, had remained remarkably strong — and could hit new peaks this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent weeks, he said, there have been signs that the market has been heating up more: 10 homes in Palo Alto sold for more than their asking prices last month, some by large amounts. Now, with the long-expected <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> public offering a step closer to reality, Mr. DeLeon said he expected to see several things happen: some sellers may keep their homes off the market until they judge the time is right, some speculators may snap up old houses to tear down and rebuild, and some buyers may feel pressure to make offers before the deluge hits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A steady stream of would-be buyers walked through the open house Mr. DeLeon held here on Sunday — a 2,325-square-foot home with a small backyard and an asking price of nearly $1.8 million. They checked out the sunken Japanese-style dining room and the heated concrete floors with leaf inlays. Many got lattes from the barista stationed in the backyard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. DeLeon said he already had plans to market to <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> employees. One strategy: he intends to buy ads on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>. “It’s amazing how you can target them,” he said.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">So Eager to Get a Foot In Real Estate's Door, They Work Without Pay</span>
</div><div class="author">By ELIZABETH A. HARRIS </div><div>1092 words</div><div>7 February 2012</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>29</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2012 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In past years, becoming a real estate agent was rarely a first-choice gig. For many people, it was a way to pay the bills while trying to break into another field. For some, it was a second career -- or maybe a third or a fourth -- tackled after the children went off to college, or earlier paths fell off a cliff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But more recently the image of the real estate agent has moved away from racks of keys and dingy walk-ups. Sashaying into the limelight by way of reality television and eye-popping sales, the profession started to seem a bit glamorous -- and compelling enough that some young people are willing to try it out for no pay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Please welcome to the bottom of the food chain an ambitious group willing to do anything, earn nothing and wake up early on a Sunday to fluff the couch cushions at your open house: the real estate broker's interns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the height of the internship application season, and young people -- at least those who can afford to work without receiving a meaningful paycheck -- are weighing their options. Those who choose to spend the summer in the land of expensive apartments may enjoy these tasks: copying keys, sending out Evites, promoting the boss on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and hiding a seller's dirty socks when potential buyers come calling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are some perks as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''On my second day of work, I was in a $28.5 million apartment,'' said John Liss, 18, who was an unpaid intern at Gumley Haft Kleier last summer, and is now a licensed agent with his own listings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unfortunately, his cut of that million-dollar-plus commission would have been nothing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everyone has heard intern horror stories: A bright young English major spends the summer at a fashion magazine, wedded to a coffee urn, making dentist appointments for her manager without a dime to show for it. And the resistance to endless hours of free labor has lately been picking up steam. Two men who interned on the movie ''Black Swan'' and one former intern at Harper's Bazaar filed lawsuits in recent months alleging that their arrangements violated wage laws, and in December, Schneider &amp; Rubin, a law firm that specializes in representing interns, opened its doors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal guidelines require that an unpaid internship (a term that comes from the first year of training that doctors receive after medical school) satisfy six criteria, including that the ''trainees'' must be taught things they might learn at vocational school or an academic institution, and that they not displace regular paid employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if training is given, however, some industry professionals consider interning with a broker a peculiar arrangement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When professional agents start their careers in earnest, ''the pay is so infrequent, it's almost like an internship already,'' said Robert Morgenstern, academic director of the continuing education programs at the Schack Institute of Real Estate at New York University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Why wouldn't you just take the licensing course and become a salesperson?'' he continued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Ross Perlin, author of ''Intern Nation: How to Earn Nothing and Learn Little in the Brave New Economy,'' internships have become par for the course in the white-collar work force, but they are especially concentrated in fields like music, movies or media that have an ''aura of glamour.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They've made it basically a requirement that you work unpaid for some period of time,'' Mr. Perlin said. Young people, he added, ''are told it's more valuable to be doing something for free in a glamorous profession than it is for them to be working at <span class="companylink">Jamba Juice</span>.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate brokers may not be stuck behind a desk, but the profession does have some less enchanting attributes, like being effectively on-call 24 hours a day, and going without one very substantial convenience: a salary. But on television shows like ''Selling New York'' on HGTV, those drawbacks don't tend to pop out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm obsessed,'' said Maxine Fouladi, 19, who interned at CORE Group NYC last summer under the managing director Emily Beare for a stipend and a small end-of-summer bonus. ''I initially got interested in real estate because I was watching HGTV.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Freddy James, a senior vice president of program development and production at HGTV, said viewers of ''Selling New York'' tended to react most strongly to the broker's commission, prominently displayed in a little bubble on the screen, even more so than they did to the sticker price of a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I see people say: 'That's my annual salary! How could they make that in just one sale!' '' Mr. James said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all broker interns are aspiring superagents. Many, like Mr. Liss, plan to go into real estate development after college and signed up to work for an agent as a way to get to know the business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regardless of what has drawn them in, a growing field of real estate professionals stand ready to take advantage of this new labor supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Web site called Intern Profits, based in California, offers instructional videos on what companies can do with interns. ''The Single Best Labor Force to Grow Your Real Estate Business!'' a headline reads. ''Why interns are much better than hiring cheap 'offshore' or third world country labor,'' a bullet point boasts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the founders, Dreama Lee, said in an interview that the company advocated only internships that provided valuable training in exchange for labor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then, of course, there are always opportunities available on <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span>, where a broker at Bond New York recently placed an advertisement calling for ''licensed real estate interns.'' (At most firms, agents are independent contractors and are free to do their own hiring.) Inquiries about the advertisement lead to Noah Freedman, one of the company's founders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't know what an intern with a license would be,'' said Mr. Freedman, who explained that he had not yet seen the ad. ''That sounds a lot like a real estate agent to me.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARIETTA, Ga. — Housing prices continue to fall nationwide, despite a few modest signs of improvement. But not all markets are equal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Places like Miami and Phoenix — symbols of boom-time excesses and later the sites of fierce crashes — were not the weakest performers last year. That distinction goes to Atlanta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A sprawling Southern metropolis, Atlanta has become one of the biggest laggards in the economic recovery. In November, prices of single-family homes were down close to 12 percent compared with a year earlier, the largest decline among major metropolitan areas, according to data[http://www.standardandpoors.com/spf/docs/case-shiller/CSHomePrice_Release_013118.pdf] released on Tuesday in the Standard &amp; Poor’s/Case-Shiller[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/s/standard_poors_caseshiller_home_price_index/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] Home Price Index. Home prices regionally are now below their levels of 2000, making Atlanta one of only four metro areas to have experienced such a slide. The price of entry-level housing in the area — the lowest tier of the market, valued at just under $96,600 — fell by close to a third last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though the national economy shows signs of strengthening, the beleaguered housing market remains a significant drag on the recovery. Across a group of 20 metropolitan areas measured by S.&amp; P./Case-Shiller, prices of single-family homes were 3.7 percent lower in November compared with a year earlier, with average prices at their 2003 levels. Economists say prices are unlikely to hit a nadir until at least late spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom Porcelli, chief United States economist at <span class="companylink">RBC Capital Markets</span> in New York, projects that average prices could slip by as much as 5 percent nationally this year because of the large amount of distressed properties for sale and a shortage of buyers. Although Mr. Porcelli describes a “generally better outlook on housing” than he has over the last few years, he added, “we still have a long way to go.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here in Marietta, a suburb north of downtown Atlanta, the decline has attracted bargain hunters like Andy Heller. One damp afternoon last month, Mr. Heller, a part-time investor, examined a four-bedroom, faded yellow house that had sold seven years ago for $208,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last fall, after a foreclosure[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/f/foreclosures/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the house was put up for sale. The asking price was slashed by more than a third last month to $99,900. Mr. Heller, eyeing kitchen cupboards with missing doors and signs of leaks in the upstairs bathroom, figured he could lop $30,000 more off the price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I am concerned as a citizen,” he said. “And on the other side as an investor, I see the opportunity of a lifetime.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reasons for Atlanta’s housing woes are both representative of the nation’s troubles and special to this former boomtown, where housing appreciated handsomely, though not to the lofty heights of Las Vegas, Miami and New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where the region once attracted thousands of prospective home buyers drawn by plentiful jobs and more affordable living, that influx has dwindled. Local unemployment, at 9.2 percent, is slightly higher than the national rate, in part because one in every four jobs lost was connected to real estate, a much higher rate than in the rest of the country. Those jobs have yet to return, while even people with work are having trouble qualifying for loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The region, plagued by mortgage fraud and developers who dotted the exurban landscape with large luxury homes that never sold, is inundated with foreclosed properties. In fact, Atlanta has the most government-owned foreclosed properties for sale of any large city, according to the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, sales of existing homes have recently picked up, prompting some economists to suggest that the housing market is finally starting to repair itself. But the number of new homes sold fell to a record low in December, and many homeowners are stuck in houses that are worth far less than they owe on their mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span>described the housing sector[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/26/business/economy/fed-to-maintain-rates-near-zero-through-late-2014.html] as “depressed,” and in his State of the Union address[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/s/state_of_the_union_message_us/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] President Obama unveiled a refinancing program[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/25/us/politics/obama-mortgage-plan-would-broaden-government-backed-loans.html] for homeowners waiting “for the housing market to hit bottom.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atlanta has suffered greatly from a contracting pool of home buyers. The number of people moving from within the United States to Atlanta peaked at 100,000 in 2006 and plunged to just 17,000 by 2009, the latest census figures available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Most of the housing activity that we experienced in the past 10 years was people moving to Atlanta from other markets,” said Domonic Purviance, real estate market analyst for the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“If you lose 80,000 people a year coming to your market,” Mr. Purviance added, “that’s the whole issue.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The collapse of the housing market also put many prospective homeowners out of work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From February 2008 to August 2011, Atlanta lost 60,000 jobs in construction and real estate, about 25 percent of job losses in the broader metropolitan area during that period. Across the nation, construction and real estate jobs were only 15 percent of total positions lost, according to an analysis of Labor Department data by IHS Global Insight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many homeowners forced into foreclosures or distressed sales are people whose livelihoods had depended on a robust housing market. That’s what happened to the owners of a three-bedroom house in Dacula, about 45 minutes northeast of downtown Atlanta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The husband, a home remodeler, had not had steady work in three years and the family was struggling to keep up with their mortgage payments. The couple, who asked not to be named because they were embarrassed to tell their extended family, were on the verge of foreclosure last month. Then Matt Hermes, an agent with Keller Williams who drives a bright red Ford F-150 pickup bearing the license plate “BUYAHOM,” persuaded them to try to sell it and negotiate with their lender to take a loss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple recently accepted an offer on the two-story brick home, which cost them $160,000 in 2002, for $119,000 and are planning to move into a rental.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such distressed sales are putting pressure on traditional sellers to slash their prices, too. In an upscale subdivision nearby, Christina West waited four years before giving in to the reality of the housing downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She and her husband bought a four-bedroom home on a manmade lake in 1999 for $374,000. They spent $100,000 installing a pool, a hot tub, a basement bar and home theater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When her husband lost his job as a sales executive at a consumer products company in 2007, the couple moved into a house that Ms. West had inherited from her mother in St. Augustine, Fla. They put the Dacula house on the market for $599,900.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They rejected several offers that they considered lowballs. “Everybody kept saying ‘Oh, it’s a great house, it will sell,’&nbsp;” Ms. West recalled. A contract for $447,000 fell through when the buyer could not secure a loan. Last month, the couple signed a contract for $360,000, effectively erasing previous gains and their large investment in improvements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other owners have simply been forced to give up their homes. In the third quarter of last year, the most recent period for which figures are available, foreclosed homes represented 24 percent of all sales in Atlanta, compared with a national rate of 12 percent, according to RealtyTrac, a data provider. Georgia is one of 30 states where a lender can foreclose on a home without appearing before a judge, which suggests that many more homes may be at risk of foreclosure in states where proceedings require court approval.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a recent tour of several homes, James H. Sinnott, a corporate lawyer who is trying to raise an investment fund for distressed properties in Atlanta, was struck by the sheer volume for sale at astonishingly low prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a well-kept subdivision in Jonesboro, south of downtown Atlanta, teenagers and elderly couples strolled the wide streets. Mr. Sinnott inspected a three-bedroom brick home that had floor-to-ceiling mirrors in several rooms, garish chandeliers and a number of stripped-out basement walls that made him suspect it had been used as a brothel. The asking price was $69,900. In Norcross, a northern suburb, he looked at a sun-filled three-bedroom home up a steep driveway that had sold for $131,300 in 2003. Now, the lender was asking just $39,900.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The glut is likely to grow. According to RealtyTrac, Atlanta has a nearly 12-month supply of foreclosed homes, about 70 percent of which are sitting on the books of servicers and lenders, waiting to go on sale. The release of just a chunk of properties can push down prices. “You can’t get a bottom until you clear the backlog,” Mr. Sinnott said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sinnott, who is new to the investment market, is having trouble raising capital. But even an expert like Mr. Heller, who has bought more than 100 houses with a partner over the last 20 years and says he has never missed a mortgage payment, is frustrated by his difficulty securing loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Typically, he buys in middle-income neighborhoods and then signs tenants to rent-to-own contracts. If he had financing, he said, he would buy as many as 100 homes this year. “If I had a lot of cash I would be going ballistic right now,” he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARIETTA, Ga. -- Housing prices continue to fall nationwide, despite a few modest signs of improvement. But not all markets are equal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Places like Miami and Phoenix -- symbols of boom-time excesses and later the sites of fierce crashes -- were not the weakest performers last year. That distinction goes to Atlanta.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A sprawling Southern metropolis, Atlanta has become one of the biggest laggards in the economic recovery. In November, prices of single-family homes were down close to 12 percent compared with a year earlier, the largest decline among major metropolitan areas, according to data released on Tuesday in the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller Home Price Index. Home prices regionally are now below their levels of 2000, making Atlanta one of only four metro areas to have experienced such a slide. The price of entry-level housing in the area -- the lowest tier of the market, valued at just under $96,600 -- fell by close to a third last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though the national economy shows signs of strengthening, the beleaguered housing market remains a significant drag on the recovery. Across a group of 20 metropolitan areas measured by S.&amp; P./Case-Shiller, prices of single-family homes were 3.7 percent lower in November compared with a year earlier, with average prices at their 2003 levels. Economists say prices are unlikely to hit a nadir until at least late spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tom Porcelli, chief United States economist at <span class="companylink">RBC Capital Markets</span> in New York, projects that average prices could slip by as much as 5 percent nationally this year because of the large amount of distressed properties for sale and a shortage of buyers. Although Mr. Porcelli describes a ''generally better outlook on housing'' than he has over the last few years, he added, ''we still have a long way to go.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here in Marietta, a suburb north of downtown Atlanta, the decline has attracted bargain hunters like Andy Heller. One damp afternoon last month, Mr. Heller, a part-time investor, examined a four-bedroom, faded yellow house that had sold seven years ago for $208,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last fall, after a foreclosure by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the house was put up for sale.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The American market for single-family homes continued to wobble, with prices declining again in November, nearly six years after they began to fall, a private report showed on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family house prices in a group of 20 metropolitan areas tracked by the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case-Shiller composite index fell by close to 0.7 percent from October, and were down by 3.7 percent from November 2010, worse than the 3.4 percent annual decline seen in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Average home prices were back down to levels last seen in mid-2003, the index showed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing has played a dominant role in the country's economic sluggishness, as homeowners have struggled with foreclosures or mortgage burdens that far exceed the values of their homes. Hundreds of thousands of construction workers and other real estate-related employees have been thrown out of work and are still struggling to cobble together incomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 28-county metropolitan Atlanta region continued to stand out as the worst performer in the index, with home prices tumbling close to 12 percent from the previous November. In addition to Atlanta, home prices in Las Vegas, Seattle and Tampa all hit new lows in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the 20 cities traced by the index, home prices fell in 19 in November; only Phoenix had higher prices from the month before. On an annual basis, only Detroit and Washington experienced price rises.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Despite continued low interest rates and better real G.D.P. growth in the fourth quarter, home prices continue to fall,'' David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>, said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The trend is down and there are few, if any, signs in the numbers that a turning point is close at hand.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since a peak in mid-2006, home prices tracked by the index have plunged by almost 33 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although economists believe the rate of declines in home prices may slow, they generally forecast further decreases this year. ''The enormous supply overhang of existing homes (particularly factoring in all those in foreclosure or soon to be) promises to keep pressure on prices for some time,'' Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR Inc., wrote in an analysis of the Case-Shiller data.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- New orders for manufactured goods rose in December and a gauge of future business investment rebounded, showing the economy ended the year with more momentum than previously thought.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other reports on Thursday showed new claims for jobless benefits rose moderately last week, suggesting the labor market was healing only slowly, while new single-family home sales unexpectedly fell in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said orders for durable goods climbed 3 percent last month, helped by a surge in aircraft orders. Economists had forecast a 2 percent rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's some momentum here,'' said Jacob Oubina, an economist at <span class="companylink">RBC Capital Markets</span> in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Heading into the first quarter, the momentum is going to be pretty decent.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Durable goods range from toasters to big items like aircraft and are meant to last three years or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data suggested that American companies could be more willing to invest the $2 trillion in cash they have amassed in recent years. The <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> warned on Wednesday that business investment had cooled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders for capital goods outside of military spending and excluding aircraft, which are a proxy for business spending plans, climbed a steeper-than-expected 2.9 percent. They had declined the previous two months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, shipments of orders within that category, which go into the calculation of gross domestic product, rose 2.9 percent after declining 1 percent in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The overall increase in orders was buoyed by an 18.9 percent jump in orders for civilian aircraft. <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> received 287 orders for aircraft during the month, according to the plane maker's Web site, increasing from 96 in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report, the Conference Board said its index of future economic activity rose to a five-month high in December as labor market conditions improved. It said that its index of leading economic indicators was up 0.4 percent in December, after a 0.2 percent increase in November and a 0.6 percent rise in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department data showed new claims for unemployment benefits rose last week but the underlying trend continued to point to improving labor market conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initial claims for state unemployment aid increased 21,000, to 377,000. The four-week moving average for initial claims, which provides a better view of trends, fell 2,500, to 377,500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're still very much established below 400,000, continuing to suggest that there is modest improvement in the labor market,'' said Lindsey M. Piegza, an economist at FTN Financial in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report coming Friday is expected to show the economy grew at a 3 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, up from 1.8 percent in the previous period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department also released a report showing new single-family home sales unexpectedly fell in December for the first time in four months, while the median home price dropped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market remains constrained by high unemployment, falling prices and an oversupply of unsold homes after a the real estate bubble that led to the 2007-9 recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, there were a record low 157,000 new homes on the market last month. That could feed additional speculation that the housing sector is on the cusp of a recovery.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Profits from Apple and a promise from the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> to maintain rock-bottom rates for at least two more years pushed stock market indexes higher on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apple led the Nasdaq to a 1 percent gain as its shares surged to a record, making it the most valuable American company in terms of market capitalization. Apple finished up 6.2 percent at $446.66.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buying picked up after the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> said it would keep interest rates near zero through at least 2014, which was longer than many investors had anticipated. The actions were taken as a sign of the central bank's commitment to bolster the sluggish economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What caught the market off guard was obviously the fact they are going to keep rates lower for longer,'' said John Canally, investment strategist at LPL Financial in Boston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed also took an unusual step by setting an inflation target of 2 percent, which brings it in line with many of the world's other central banks that use an explicit benchmark to set policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand for bonds was higher. The Treasury's 10-year note rose 18/32, to 100. The yield fell to 2.0 percent, from 2.06 percent late Tuesday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How goes the state of the union? Well, the state of the economy remains terrible. Three years after President Obama's inauguration and two and a half years since the official end of the recession, unemployment remains painfully high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are reasons to think that we're finally on the (slow) road to better times. And we wouldn't be on that road if Mr. Obama had given in to Republican demands that he slash spending, or the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve</span> had given in to Republican demands that it tighten money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why am I letting a bit of optimism break through the clouds? Recent economic data have been a bit better, but we've already had several false dawns on that front. More important, there's evidence that the two great problems at the root of our slump -- the housing bust and excessive private debt -- are finally easing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On housing: as everyone now knows (but oh, the abuse heaped on anyone pointing it out while it was happening!), we had a monstrous housing bubble between 2000 and 2006. Home prices soared, and there was clearly a lot of overbuilding. When the bubble burst, construction -- which had been the economy's main driver during the alleged ''Bush boom'' -- plunged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the bubble began deflating almost six years ago; house prices are back to 2003 levels. And after a protracted slump in housing starts, America now looks seriously underprovided with houses, at least by historical standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So why aren't people going out and buying? Because the depressed state of the economy leaves many people who would normally be buying homes either unable to afford them or too worried about job prospects to take the risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the economy is depressed, in large part, because of the housing bust, which immediately suggests the possibility of a virtuous circle: an improving economy leads to a surge in home purchases, which leads to more construction, which strengthens the economy further, and so on. And if you squint hard at recent data, it looks as if something like that may be starting: home sales are up, unemployment claims are down, and builders' confidence is rising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Furthermore, the chances for a virtuous circle have been rising, because we've made significant progress on the debt front.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's not what you hear in public debate, of course, where all the focus is on rising government debt. But anyone who has looked seriously at how we got into this slump knows that private debt, especially household debt, was the real culprit: it was the explosion of household debt during the Bush years that set the stage for the crisis. And the good news is that this private debt has declined in dollar terms, and declined substantially as a percentage of G.D.P., since the end of 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are, of course, still big risks -- above all, the risk that trouble in Europe could derail our own incipient recovery. And thereby hangs a tale -- a tale told by a recent report from the McKinsey Global Institute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report tracks progress on ''deleveraging,'' the process of bringing down excessive debt levels. It documents substantial progress in the United States, which it contrasts with failure to make progress in Europe. And while the report doesn't say this explicitly, it's pretty clear why Europe is doing worse than we are: it's because European policy makers have been afraid of the wrong things.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In particular, the European Central Bank has been worrying about inflation -- even raising interest rates during 2011, only to reverse course later in the year -- rather than worrying about how to sustain economic recovery. And fiscal austerity, which is supposed to limit the increase in government debt, has depressed the economy, making it impossible to achieve urgently needed reductions in private debt. The end result is that for all their moralizing about the evils of borrowing, the Europeans aren't making any progress against excessive debt -- whereas we are.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back to the U.S. situation: my guarded optimism should not be taken as a statement that all is well. We have already suffered enormous, unnecessary damage because of an inadequate response to the slump. We have failed to provide significant mortgage relief, which could have moved us much more quickly to lower debt. And even if my hoped-for virtuous circle is getting under way, it will be years before we get to anything resembling full employment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But things could have been worse; they would have been worse if we had followed the policies demanded by Mr. Obama's opponents. For as I said at the beginning, Republicans have been demanding that the Fed stop trying to bring down interest rates and that federal spending be slashed immediately -- which amounts to demanding that we emulate Europe's failure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And if this year's election brings the wrong ideology to power, America's nascent recovery might well be snuffed out.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FRIGID winter temperatures have just arrived in the Northeast, and beach-ready bodies are thousands of sit-ups away. But for some buyers and summer renters -- especially year-end bonus recipients -- now is when thoughts turn toward house-hunting in the Hamptons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the fall of <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> and several years when buyers and renters had the upper hand, in 2011 the Hamptons real estate market showed signs of a revival; agents expect it will continue in 2012. Although prices are still down from the peak of the boom years, they are showing a steady recovery, and more houses are changing hands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The major brokerages will release their year-end sales reports in the coming weeks, but throughout most of last year, sales were particularly strong at the high end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel, said 69 houses in the Hamptons sold for $5 million or more in the first three quarters of 2011, compared with 61 in the same period the previous year. In one of last year's biggest deals, a 55-acre North Haven waterfront estate called Tyndal Point sold last spring for $36 million. Although it was originally listed in 2007 for an eye-popping $80 million, it still brought an impressive figure for a house north of Highway 27, the Hamptons' main thoroughfare. While the side south of the highway is closer to the ocean, there is nothing shabby about a place on a peninsula with 3,000 feet of shoreline offering sunrise and sunset views.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miller said there would have been even more sales in that upper bracket last winter, if there hadn't been concerns that the Bush tax cuts might be eliminated, which caused a flurry of activity in the fourth quarter of 2010 and a correspondingly quiet first quarter of 2011. He added that the activity in the high end was not necessarily trickling down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Are all these trophy property sales a proxy for the state of the housing market?'' Mr. Miller asked. ''My answer is no. It's a small sliver of the market, and it's motivated for very different reasons. If you look at the sub-million-dollar market, that market is flat.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for which areas are faring particularly well, brokers say Sagaponack and Bridgehampton are hot, particularly among the finance set.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It used to be the estate areas of East Hampton and Southampton were always the crown jewel,'' said Judi Desiderio, the chief executive of Town and Country Real Estate. ''It seems there's a new buyer, a younger buyer, and they're happy to be in the farm fields of Sagaponack and Bridgehampton.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Surfers, younger people and those seeking a less buttoned-down night life are still gravitating toward Montauk, which has a more eclectic mix of properties than tony neighbors like East Hampton. But that has not yet translated into huge deals on the high end, said Paul Brennan, the regional manager of the Hamptons office of Prudential Douglas Elliman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, some noteworthy new properties are being built. Mr. Brennan is selling a 5,000-square-foot modern house with a guesthouse for $25 million, on a bluff overlooking the ocean in Montauk. Designed by James Biber, of Biber Architects, the house has steel-and-glass rooms maximizing views and outdoor space, while a brick-and-wood wing offers more of a retreat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gary DePersia, a senior vice president of Corcoran, says contemporary houses are more in demand these days, partly because fewer of them are available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A great modern house very often will do better in price per square foot than its traditional brethren,'' he said, adding that tastes had shifted toward simpler, sleeker interiors, even in houses externally in keeping with their shingled neighbors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sales price for a Hamptons home was $850,000 in the third quarter of last year, according to the most recent data compiled by Mr. Miller for Prudential Douglas Elliman. That is up 22 percent from the same quarter in 2010 but still down from the peak of $1.1 million in the second quarter of 2007 -- typically the strongest quarter of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the figures in the report are for all houses sold and do not reflect what most people will pay for a summer house -- somewhere between $1 million and $5 million, depending on beach proximity and amenities like a gunite pool -- they do highlight market trends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''From peak to trough, prices fell about 30 percent,'' Mr. Miller said. ''That was an overcorrection; we've already recovered about half of it. I think there's room for pricing to grow going forward, but that's going to take a few years.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps a better gauge of the market is how many ''sold'' signs are popping up in front of the hedges. From that perspective, things are picking up. There were 398 sales in the Hamptons in the third quarter, up 12 percent from the same period in 2010. But that compared with 651 homes sold in the third quarter of 2005, the year sales activity peaked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The year-end reports due out in the next few weeks will show whether the Hamptons mirrored the Manhattan market, which saw a significant slowdown in sales activity at the end of the year. But many brokers are optimistic, predicting that any dip will be a temporary reaction to last year's stock market swings and economic uncertainties -- a pause, rather than the beginning of another freeze.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Diane Saatchi, a senior vice president of Saunders &amp; Associates and a longtime Hamptons broker, says a few high-end deals can skew the data. But she pointed to a more intuitive economic indicator that she said tended to reflect real estate trends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You probably can get the best read on the market by looking at the activity on various main streets,'' Ms. Saatchi said. ''When you see stores full and restaurants crowded, you know business is good. It's clearly brighter here than it was in 2008, 2009 and 2010.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, the persistent consolidation of real estate firms indicates some uncertainty about the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, Town and Country acquired Kathleen Beckmann Real Estate of Montauk, after acquiring the Westhampton brokerage Phillips Beach Realty in March. Last October, the East Hampton agency Devlin McNiff teamed up with Halstead Property of Manhattan, expanding Halstead's reach into the Hamptons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For more than a decade, the Hamptons has been subject to an influx of New York City agencies, led by Corcoran and Elliman. But brokers say the latest round of reshuffling is a sign of the economic times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The market got smaller after 2008, had a really terrible year in 2009, then in 2010 and 2011 it stabilized,'' said Stuart Epstein, the managing director of what is now called Devlin McNiff Halstead Property. ''But it's still smaller than it was. That means there are a lot of people looking to make a living in a smaller market.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Epstein said he and his wife, Lynn, decided to partner with Halstead in order to stay competitive, especially given the Internet, which has not so much leveled the playing field as made it more costly for little firms to keep up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Really,'' he said, ''it was a feeling that in order to play in the big leagues at this point going forward, we needed the clout we could get from that company in terms of marketing, technology and their referral network.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That does not mean local, independent agencies are going away. But for small brokers looking for a lifestyle change or a way to compete in a tougher market, affiliating with a larger firm seems to be gaining appeal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the market is basically trending toward higher prices, few properties are snapped up right away for the asking price. On average, homes sit for 170 days before selling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Southampton Village, Joseph Hall and his partner are trying to sell a traditional three-bedroom house renovated to appeal to current tastes, with a wine refrigerator in the eat-in kitchen and a generally minimalist decor. Offered for $1.995 million last fall, the place was originally listed for $2.7 million in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That year,'' Mr. Hall said, ''we didn't even reply to offers that were higher than where we have it listed now.'' The house was taken off the market when the economy tanked. He thinks it is now well priced: ''We didn't expect that it would move immediately and we're happy to wait it out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hall and his partner use their house in the summer, but many Hamptons sellers are waiting out longer selling periods by taking advantage of the strong market for rentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The rental market did very well on the high end last year,'' said Mr. DePersia of Corcoran. ''I think it's going to be another good year.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of his listings, a 12-bedroom Bridgehampton estate with a recreation pavilion (including a two-lane bowling alley, a skateboard half-pipe, a racquetball court, a media room, a disco and a spa), has commanded more than $500,000 for two-week rentals in the past couple of summers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 10-bedroom resort in Water Mill ($695,000 for Memorial Day to Labor Day) is also available for short-term rentals, illustrating homeowners' new willingness to accommodate renters' schedules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the lower end of the scale, he said, summer renters can find a house for $50,000 a month in the Northwest Woods or the village of East Hampton, or south of the highway in Amagansett. Double that price gets you more amenities closer to the beach, and there are cheaper options as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When people rent a house,'' Mr. DePersia said, ''they make concessions they wouldn't necessarily make when they buy a house. What's good to know is that there is a house for everyone out here. It depends on what your level of compromise is and what you're willing to pay.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hamptons, by the Numbers</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sale price in the third quarter of 2011 was $850,000, a 22.1 percent increase over the third quarter in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were 398 sales in the quarter, a 12.4 percent increase over the same period in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the top 10 percent of all sales, the median price was $5.45 million, a 22.8 percent increase over the second quarter of 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hamptons sales market reached its high point in 2007, with a median price of $975,000.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales in the United States rose in December to the highest pace in nearly a year, the National Association of Realtors reported. The gain coincided with other signs that show the troubled housing market improved at the end of 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, sales remain depressed and ended the year well below healthy levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtors group said home sales increased 5 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.61 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The pattern of home sales in recent months demonstrates a market in recovery,'' said Lawrence Yun, the group's chief economist. ''Record low mortgage interest rates, job growth and bargain home prices are giving more consumers the confidence they need to enter the market.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the year, home sales totaled only 4.26 million, up from 4.19 million the previous year. Since the housing bust four years ago, home sales have slumped under the weight of foreclosures, tighter credit and falling price.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A reminder that there is a housing crash in progress:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders started construction on just 428,600 single-family homes in 2011 and completed just 444,900 single-family homes, the Census Bureau reported Thursday. Both were the lowest totals since the bureau started keeping records in 1959. And the last few years have been much worse than any other stretch during that period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is even more striking to adjust the level of construction for population growth. In 1982, the previous nadir, builders started construction on one new home for every 350 United States residents. In 2011, one new home was started for every 727 residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Including multifamily homes changes the picture somewhat. The 583,900 housing units completed in 2011 is stil the lowest number on record, but multifamily construction activity is starting to increase. Construction started on 606,900 units during the year, exceeding the totals in 2009 and 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there is growing sentiment among home builders and economists that the bottom has been reached and construction will increase in 2012. Builders are securing more permits, and the pace of housing starts rose in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is not another false dawn; it's the real deal," Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics, wrote in a note to clients this week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates remain at record lows, more people are finding jobs, and Mr. Shepherdson sees signs that lenders are starting to loosen their purse strings. He points to a decline in average required down payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Add in the possibility of a huge settlement that could help some homeowners avoid foreclosure and allow lenders to foreclose on others more quickly, and there is reason to think the records set last year will endure.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FOR whatever reason, homes sales picked up in New Jersey[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/classifieds/realestate/locations/newjersey/?inline=nyt-geo] in the latter part of 2011. A new statewide market report shows contract signings increased in six of the seven months from May through November, compared with 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, the inventory of homes for sale shrank every month since May, according to Jeffrey G. Otteau, an analyst, whose Otteau Valuation Group[http://www.otteau.com/] in East Brunswick does monthly reports for the real estate industry; he called the latest news a concrete sign that the market was “stabilizing.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His December report was the first one in several years to sound a hopeful note. Until the state’s huge foreclosure backlog comes back on the market — and how fast that happens is important — the market may improve sometime this year to the point that prices stop declining and perhaps even modestly start to rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that is the statewide picture. A great division in market fortunes between northern and southern Jersey — and urbanized areas close to Manhattan[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/classifieds/realestate/locations/newyork/newyorkcity/manhattan/?inline=nyt-geo] and more rural regions — became clear during the recent recession and remains stark in the fresh statistics. Mr. Otteau predicted that the gap would shape the timing and pattern of potential recovery, and several agents in the field agreed with him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Simply put,” said Dawn Rapa, a Coldwell Banker Elite agent working in rural Salem County, “the only people I’ve seen selling their houses recently are those who absolutely had to — because they were in financial disarray, a job change, divorce or death.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Salem County, rich in historic houses and farmland but short on well-paying jobs or a quick commute to an urban center, has the largest inventory of all 21 counties surveyed: 44.5 months’ worth of houses, the preponderance of them priced under $400,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That compares with a statewide inventory of 13 months, both over all and in the under-$400,000 category.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several other counties in southern New Jersey have inventories about twice the size of the state average — 29 months’ worth in Cumberland County, 26 in Cape May County, and 24 in Atlantic County.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Cape May and Atlantic, the primary backlog is for more expensive homes, many of them built in the boom years to appeal to shoreline vacationers. Atlantic has just shy of six years’ worth of inventory in the $600,000-to-$1 million range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For homes priced from $1 million to $2.5 million, the Otteau report predicted, it will take more than four years to sell the inventory in Atlantic County and close to seven years in Ocean County.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Cumberland County, which like Salem is part of the Delaware Valley area that extends eastward from Pennsylvania, the homes are mostly priced under $400,000. There are not enough homes priced higher to be statistically significant, according to the report. Ms. Rapa said she sold 37 houses in Salem County last year, but prices were down “considerably.” And multiple listing numbers indicate that although inventory dipped 10 percent, there were 14 percent fewer sales over all compared with the year before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two of the Coldwell Banker agent’s listings that have sat on the market for many months despite price drops: a restored and modernized 1851 colonial in the historic hamlet of Alloway with three bedrooms and two baths, now offered at $186,000; and a four-bedroom two-bath house on a horse farm with a barn and 10 acres in Pilesgrove, now listed for $349,900.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“We just had an offer for $312,000 on the Pilesgrove house,” first listed in February 2011, said Ms. Rapa, “but the owners won’t go there.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market misery is not all concentrated in the south, however. In the northernmost county, Sussex, the inventory is 20 months. In the $400,000-to-$599,999 bracket, five and a half years’ supply is already on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the town of Vernon, which is home to several popular ski areas, and where construction was booming in the mid-2000s, the average sale price of a home was $250,000 in 2007, according to the real estate Web site <span class="companylink">Trulia</span>. Now the site has it at $100,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A large house set on 1.3 acres there, with a view of ski slopes from the deck, was built and sold in 2004 for $392,000. The house, with three bedrooms and three and a half baths on Cherokee Trail, has been on the market since October, and the asking price is now $358,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearby in the somewhat more affluent town of Sparta, a number of large houses built about a decade ago on one-acre or larger lots are now being offered at reduced prices or as short sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“Houses are selling,” said Catherine Kut, an agent at <span class="companylink">Weichert Realtors</span> in Sparta, “but they have to be in fabulous condition and still occupied, as a rule.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“I had a closing yesterday,” she said earlier this month. “The house was $438,000, and it sold in less than 90 days, but it was a cream puff. It had almost five acres of land, a finished walkout basement, brand-new granite counters — everything.”</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another of her listings was in great shape when it went on the market for $525,000 last February after the owner lost his job. A four-bedroom two-and-a-half-bath house, it is set on 1.3 acres and has a pool, and it was attractively decorated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the seller had to relocate for new employment. Now the vacant house is on the market as a short sale, in which a lender agrees to accept less than the amount owed on the mortgage, and listed at $445,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An ice dam formed on the roof earlier this winter and caused exterior damage, so a credit is being offered on the sale price to cover the cost of repairs.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHOENIX -- To the unknowing, the few dozen people milling around the picnic tables in front of the Maricopa County courthouse here every day could be jurors on break or scofflaws finally coming to pay a ticket. They tug on cigarettes, sip from big cups of coffee and fidget with their cellphones, often speaking in whispers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But instead of waiting to meet a judge, they are preparing to bid on the hundreds of foreclosed properties auctioned each week in one of the country's more colorful public clearinghouses. During the housing boom, when mortgages were being given out with no money down and prices soared, the auctions were a sleepy sideshow. But in the years since, the auctions have grown into a scruffy economic circus where bargain hunters from around the world have scooped up houses often sold for less than half of the value of the mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The auctions look more like a low-end poker game than the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. The bidders and auctioneers, most of them men in their 20s and 30s, are on a clubby first-name basis, and their banter can border on sophomoric. But their trading serves a critical if somewhat heartless function: to find new buyers for houses so they can be fixed up and sold to more stable owners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is capitalism at its rawest,'' said Brad Grannis, a bidder from AZ Property Advisors. ''There's an asset, and people assign a value to it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent months, the auctions have become more competitive because of an influx of outsiders who are eager for cut-rate houses that they can resell or rent out and because of a decrease in the number of houses available. There were 2,296 trustee sales in Maricopa County last month, 44 percent fewer than in December two years ago during the depths of the market crash, according to The Cromford Report, a real estate newsletter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many economists say that the housing market has a long way to go before it returns to health and that the decline in foreclosures is partly because lenders, often under political pressure, are trying to work with distressed borrowers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But optimists in Phoenix point to the decline as a harbinger of an upturn, albeit a tentative one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We went lower than anywhere except Las Vegas, and we got through the foreclosure crisis faster,'' said Mike Orr, a researcher at the W. P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University and the editor of The Cromford Report. ''I don't know if this will be a significant recovery, but even going up a few points is still a recovery.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The courthouse auctions have a bloodlessness that belies their impact on people's lives. Every day, in the rain, morning chill or scorching heat, a half-dozen auctioneers set up shop on the picnic tables in front of the courthouse. They flip open their laptops and read off the addresses of the properties for sale, the value of each mortgage, the taxes due and the opening bid, which the seller determines. Homeowners' names are never mentioned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bidders, many wearing jeans, hoodies and the occasional nose ring, work for investors who rarely attend the actual bidding. Increasingly, those investors come from Canada, China and other countries where Arizona property looks like a bargain. Local investors say these newcomers, as well as hedge funds, have driven up prices and made it harder to turn a profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bidders register with each auctioneer and must produce a $10,000 certified check. They consult their spreadsheets on clipboards or iPads, which list the homes for sale. Many wear earpieces connected to cellphones so they can instantly relay the prices during the auction to their bosses, who know the limit of their clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's no emotion in the bidding,'' said Mary Nicholes, who runs the Home Ownership Center of Arizona, which bids on behalf of investors who want to rent out their homes. ''They all have their number.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bidding moves quickly, but there are no secret signals and bidders rarely make eye contact. The regulars help one another, and they will also cheer or encourage colleagues as if they were investing their own money. ''You got a hole in one!'' one bidder yelled to another who had just bought a house with virtually no bidding. Bidding companies are typically paid a flat fee of about $2,500 or 3 percent of the purchase price, with a share of that money going to the bidder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No rules are posted, but the bidders obey a strict code, the cardinal rule of which is that those who fail to pay their bills can no longer bid. One former bidder earned the nickname Runaway Bride after she won an auction for the wrong house, panicked and fled the scene without paying her $10,000 deposit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Individual bidders show up, too. Christopher St. John, a longtime broker in Phoenix, recently went to bid on a house that was near another one that he bought and resold last year, making a $16,000 profit. Bidding at the auction started at $119,700 and zoomed past Mr. St. John's limit of $125,000. The auctioneer, in chinos, a golf shirt and a Diamondbacks baseball cap, eventually sold the house for $158,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. St. John thought the house was worth no more than $175,000, and because he would have to pay about $15,000 to fix it and cover any fees and taxes, bidding that high did not make sense to him. But to well-heeled investors, a smaller profit was acceptable, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's amazing how different it is now and how many more people there are,'' he said. ''It's a battle to get properties.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At times, the auctioneers and bidders are confronted with the reality of what they are trading. Some homeowners come to see their houses sold and vent their anger. A few bring video cameras to film the auction, trying to intimidate the bidders. Every so often a homeowner, having walked away from the mortgage, will bid on his own house. In recent weeks, protesters from the Occupy Phoenix movement camped in the park across the street have stopped by to appeal for an end to the auctions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For some bidders, the intrusion is another reminder of the hardship that they themselves are enduring. This month, Kelly Galles started working as a bidder after a bout with cancer forced her to give up her job teaching preschool. Her husband, who worked in construction until the downturn, is one of the auctioneers. Lured to Arizona from California during good times, they bought a house that is now worth less than what they owe on it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a pretty exciting job,'' she said. ''The downside is these are people's homes. We're lucky not to be here ourselves.''</p>
