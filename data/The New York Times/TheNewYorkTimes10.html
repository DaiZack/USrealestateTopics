<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MOTORISTS might be forgiven for thinking that New York has been snubbing them. Times Square has been covered with tables and chairs. Broad strips of streets have been painted green and handed over to cyclists. Builders continue to snap up parking lots for development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fewer people appear to be relying on their cars as well. There were 247,965 registered cars in Manhattan last year, according to statistics compiled by AAA New York, versus 251,136 in 2007, continuing a recent downward trend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even as New York profoundly rethinks the role that cars should play as a way to get around, some developers are betting that well-heeled buyers will still want their own vehicles -- and will pay extra for the privilege of parking them under their own roof.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One recent undertaking is the Carriage House, an eight-story condo at 159 West 24th Street, near Seventh Avenue. In addition to its 24 units, which range from studios to multilevel penthouses, the beige-brick building will have eight internal parking spaces when construction wraps next month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers of the two penthouses will each be guaranteed a parking spot, but the remaining six will be sold for about $200,000 apiece, said Eamon Roche, a principal of Roundtable Builders, the contractor and a partner on the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Roche has teamed with Millhouse Properties, a New York developer that specializes in distressed properties. In 2008 the same developers began a similar sales effort, and contracts went out for 10 of the units, Mr. Gray said. But those sales came soon after <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span>'s collapse, and buyers found it nearly impossible to line up financing. He said that led the developers to default on construction loans, which in turn set off a foreclosure process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices will be about $1,200 a square foot, though the state attorney general's office has yet to approve the condominium offering plan, said Eric Gray, Millhouse's managing partner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At that price the smallest studio, with 560 square feet, will be listed at $672,000; the largest two-bedroom, with 1,600 square feet, at $1.9 million. A two-bedroom duplex penthouse with two levels of terraces -- the largest unit -- will be about $4.3 million, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From 1917 to 2007, the 1901 building was a parking garage with nearly 300 spaces -- and as such had a curb cut, which are generally difficult to obtain permits for. Before that it served as a stable, and horses were transported from floor to floor by elevator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Intentionally or not, 24th Street has become a sort of locus for unusual parking arrangements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At No. 148, near Lexington Avenue, a condo called One48 is being co-developed by the American Development Group and Langsam Property Services. Sales start this week for the 15-story, 55-unit condo. It is adjacent to a 64-space garage that the developers have built fully automated -- which means machines essentially lift vehicles and ease them into berths.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The garage, which opened in December, is public, but residents have the option of leasing spaces for about $375 a month, said Perry Finkelman, the chief executive of American Development. Studios at the condo start at $399,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And at 200 Eleventh Avenue, a corner condominium at West 24th, almost every one of the 16 units comes with a parking spot next to the living room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What Bloomberg is trying to do, cutting down on the roads, it will come to a point where it will cost so much money to park in Manhattan that people will have to find alternate places,'' said Glauco Lolli-Ghetti, a principal of Urban Muse, which developed 200 Eleventh with Young Woo &amp; Associates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far 15 units have sold at $3 million to $17 million. ''I think it's proof,'' he said, ''that this is a huge amenity that people are willing to pay for.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEVERLY HILLS, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AMID the ubiquitous urban housewives in Lululemon cropped pants, yoga mats under their arms, two 20-somethings bounded down Rodeo Drive here one recent day and stopped in front of the Beverly Wilshire Hotel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Oh! This is where Julia Roberts filmed 'Pretty Woman!' '' squealed one as she snapped a photograph of the hotel made famous more than two decades ago. Her friend, disappointed at not seeing any celebrities, suggested they go to the Beverly Center, a nondescript mall on La Cienega Boulevard, instead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later that afternoon, their conversation was recounted to Barry Brucker, the new mayor of Beverly Hills, by a reporter visiting his city hall office. Mr. Brucker nodded knowingly. A graduate of Beverly Hills High, he lamented how his hometown, a glamorous haven since the 1920s, had begun to resemble every upscale Southern California shopping center anchored by a Pottery Barn and Gap. Even some of Rodeo Drive's most prized retailers -- Prada, Tiffany and Fendi -- had opened boutiques in less exclusive areas nearby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beverly Hills, long renowned for its glorious movie stars, fabulous hotels and outlandish estates, was still elite, Mr. Brucker argued. But it was hardly unique. This is why, in the past year, he said, the city has sought to recruit ''one-of-a-kind, superclassy stores'' to Rodeo Drive, including Badgley Mischka's flagship, which opened two months ago, and Tom Ford's boutique, which made its debut with a star-studded cocktail party in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He crowed, too, that MGM is moving its offices there soon, four years after the <span class="companylink">Creative Artists Agency</span>, Hollywood's most powerful talent agency, and a rival agency, ICM, decamped for the high-rise, rather sterile environs of Century City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in what seemed like either a clever marketing scheme or a desperate gambit, Mr. Brucker then pulled out prototypes of his latest project: a Beverly Hills credit card. ''It's the ultimate accessory,'' he said, beaming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hollywood's celebrity culture has taken a hit in recent years and Beverly Hills has felt it more than most. More than a decade ago the city, independent from Los Angeles, sought to make Rodeo Drive and its surrounding streets more tourist-friendly. Sightseers came in droves -- more interested, though, in a rare sighting of Taylor Swift at the Farm restaurant, or buying an inexpensive bauble at Bebe (which some critics said spelled the end of Rodeo Drive in 2005) than in spending $8,000 on a <span class="companylink">Dolce &amp; Gabbana</span> tailored gown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent rise of aggressive paparazzi has not helped either, driving even B-list celebrities and studio executives behind the walled compounds and 10-foot shrubs of more secluded communities like Bel Air, Brentwood and Pacific Palisades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now paparazzi are more likely to take photographs of a casually dressed Reese Witherspoon shopping for fragrances at the Brentwood Country Mart, where Ben Affleck, family in tow, sometimes eats lunch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, Brentwood was the scene of a recent fund-raising dinner at which President Obama was a guest; Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg, who live nearby, attended.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kurt Rappaport, a real estate agent of the well-to-do and an owner of the Westside Estate Agency, said 60 percent of his home sales are now in Brentwood, Pacific Palisades and Santa Monica compared with 50 percent three years ago. And last summer, Starline Tours, best known for its frequent stops to view Beverly Hills celebrity mansions, began a tour of celebrity homes in Malibu, visiting the beach chalets of stars like Cher, Leonardo DiCaprio and Adam Sandler.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a different world now,'' said Caroline Styne, a business partner of Suzanne Goin, the chef. The two opened the renowned Lucques, AOC Winebar (both in West Hollywood) and Tavern in Brentwood, where President Obama dined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The glow seems to have moved west,'' Ms. Styne said. ''Beverly Hills is not what it was.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, don't tell that to anyone who has lived there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't believe that,'' said Kyle Richards, a star of ''The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.'' ''It is a glamorous town. Beautiful people. Houses. Cars.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Badgley Mischka returned to Rodeo Drive after abandoning Beverly Hills three years earlier for the Sunset Plaza in West Hollywood. Mark Badgley said he and his business partner, James Mischka, missed their older customers, who visit by appointment, as well as travelers staying at nearby luxury hotels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You can't do anything on Rodeo Drive that is not noticed around the world,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beverly Hills gained fame in the 1920s when actors including Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks Sr. and Will Rogers built estates there, a convergence the city used to market itself as a movie industry playground. Others flocked there, including Lucille Ball, Jimmy Stewart and Elvis Presley. Back then, Beverly Hills was a quiet community where celebrities were largely left alone, a description many give to Brentwood now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The people who live here don't really like all those tourists,'' said Jade Mills, a real estate agent in Beverly Hills who is representing Jennifer Aniston in the sale of her home there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Phil McGraw, the television personality, said he recently sold his Beverly Hills home, which was popular on the celebrity tour circuit. ''You feel like you are living in a theme park,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the 1990s and 2000s, developers began tearing down the former homes of celebrities to make way for gated mega-mansions. Preservationists cried foul when the house of Rosemary Clooney, where George Gershwin had lived, was demolished in 2005, three years after her death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Every place has an identity and a story to tell, and Beverly Hills is about celebrity,'' said Adrian Scott Fine, the director of advocacy for the Los Angeles Conservancy, which seeks to protect architecture. ''You can't tell the story if you don't have buildings to portray it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Brentwood was gaining ground among Hollywood's power brokers because of its large lots, secluded homes and easy access to the 405 Freeway, which splits Los Angeles into east and west. Robert Iger, chief executive of the <span class="companylink">Walt Disney Company</span>, is a resident, as is Joel Silver, the producer of the ''Matrix'' series, and Ari Emanuel, a chief executive of William Morris Endeavor Entertainment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Hollywood executives like to congregate near each other,'' said Mr. Rappaport, the real estate broker. ''When you get one, you get them all.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, Beverly Hills still has its star wattage, Tom Cruise and David and Victoria Beckham among them. Dr. Phil moved to a more secluded estate there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city is popular, too, among Internet entrepreneurs and others who consider Beverly Hills real estate a safe investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of the people who have money in Beverly Hills aren't just in entertainment,'' Ms. Mills said. ''That old kind of money is gone.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three decades ago, Iranian Jews who fled their country after the shah was forced into exile decamped to Beverly Hills and now make up about 20 percent of the population, according to published statistics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Anytime I get a foreign investor, all they want is 90210,'' said Mauricio Umansky, a real estate agent and the husband of Ms. Richards, referring to the Beverly Hills ZIP code. ''These guys in Qatar and Saudi Arabia, they don't know anything about Brentwood.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ms. Styne said that while some people questioned her and Ms. Goin about their decision to open a restaurant in Brentwood, to them it made sense. After-hours, she said, ''no one wants to go east of the 405.'' Beverly Hills, she said, ''is a shopping mall.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the Progressive Credit Union began negotiations to renew the lease for its 9,800-square-foot office near Penn Station in Manhattan, the landlord offered terms that would have more than doubled the rent, to $40 per square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The credit union's treasurer and chief executive, Robert Familant, rejected the offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was 2009,'' Mr. Familant said, ''and in spite of what was supposed to be a very weak economy, we were offered what I thought was an average new lease at best.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The landlord then offered a substantially lower rent -- but remeasured the office and common space, contending Progressive would have to pay for almost 12,000 square feet, effectively making the rent $38 a square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I am told it is a common New York City commercial landlord strategy,'' Mr. Familant said. ''I'm thinking, 'If this is how a quality tenant is treated in a bad economy, we would be a lamb being led to slaughter in a good one.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So Progressive decided to buy its own office space. The company paid $450 per square foot for a 15,000-square-foot office at 131 West 33rd Street, one of the few commercial buildings in Manhattan offering office condominiums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I became determined not to allow the company to be at a landlord's mercy in the future,'' Mr. Familant said. ''It's only been 18 months since we bought, and less than a year since we moved in, but so far we are very happy with the decision we made.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Office co-ops and condominiums began appearing in New York in the late 1970s. Since then, it has remained a niche market, representing only about 2 percent of the 500 million square feet of office space in Manhattan, said Michael Rudder, a principal of the commercial real estate brokerage Rudder Property Group, which specializes in office condominiums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the real estate slump of 2008, office condominiums accounted for almost $400 million in Manhattan sales annually, Mr. Rudder said. Those sales were cut in half by the economic crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, however, several office condominiums have been built, converted from other uses or proposed in Manhattan in response to an increase in demand from various market sectors, Mr. Rudder said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Much like all aspects of the commercial real estate market, I'd say the values of office condos went down about 40 percent'' after the market crash of 2008, he said. ''With that lower value, I think a greater variety of prospective purchasers have emerged.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Office condominiums, which tend to be more popular in other American cities than in New York, are also the norm in most European and Asian markets, Mr. Rudder said. Thus, businesses from those countries opening branches in New York, and businesses with principals native to Asian countries, typically leap at the opportunity to buy, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Whether you're in Bombay or Beijing, if you're a business owner, and you have office space, you most likely own your space,'' he said. ''So when those businesses come to New York, when the opportunity to buy at a good price comes, it's a cultural desire to want to own.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Youngwoo &amp; Associates, a property developer in New York whose principal, Young S. Woo, is Korean, nodded to that cultural preference by creating commercial condominiums at 139 Centre Street, a nine-story building in Chinatown. The units have been on the market for a little more than two years, and only seven of 144 office condos and two of 10 retail condos remain unsold, said Margarette Lee, a principal with Youngwoo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost all the buyers are Chinese, Ms. Lee said. ''We kind of understand the Chinese culture,'' she said. ''Asians, especially Chinese people, love to own real estate, to give it to their sons and grandsons. It's important within the family.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most buyers were willing to pay $900 to $950 a square foot for the office condos, a relatively high price, Ms. Lee said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Chinese buyers are willing to spend more money to own than to lease,'' she said. ''The whole concept is, if you lease it and pay rent, you're throwing money out, whereas if you make mortgage payments, at the end of the day, it's yours.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Youngwoo &amp; Associates, which also built the Chelsea Arts Tower at 545 West 25th Street, a commercial condominium building for the arts and fashion industries, would like to build another office condominium in Manhattan, or convert a building to one, Ms. Lee said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another reason that 139 Centre Street sold relatively quickly, even in the recession, is that owning offices has become popular with doctors, brokers said. More than 90 percent of 139 Centre Street is medical offices, Ms. Lee said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most doctors, who typically have high infrastructure costs associated with setting up their offices, do not want to be subject to a lease renewal every five or 10 years, Mr. Rudder said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The International Gem Tower at 50 West 47th Street, which is also selling office condos, has attracted another niche market. Joseph Lipton, a partner in the 740,000-square-foot tower, which is under construction, said developers initially planned to lease offices, but the market downturn in 2008 scotched that idea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We realized construction costs would not have permitted us to rent in the new market environment at a number that would have given us a return,'' Mr. Lipton said. ''We would have been upside down.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But recognizing the allure of office condominiums to businesses in the international diamond, gem and jewelry trade, the developers believed they could turn a profit with office sales, he said. Current asking prices are $1,000 a square foot, and the 20 floors released for sale in the 34-story tower are 60 percent under contract, Mr. Lipton said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Nikunj Parekh, the owner of <span class="companylink">Laxmi Diamond</span> NY, buying a 2,200-square-foot office in the International Gem Tower, after leasing 1,500 square feet nearby, was a logical decision, largely based on a cultural preference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If I'm going to be in the business for a while, there's no point in paying rent when I can really build up equity in the longer run,'' Mr. Parekh said. ''I'd rather own it than rent it. That's what we are used to in our community and back in India.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many American businesses shy away from buying office space, believing ownership can hobble a growing business, but Mr. Parekh said he felt comfortable buying a little more space than he needed, to accommodate growth. ''I'm not doing manufacturing,'' he said. ''It's basically a sales office, so I'm hoping this will be enough for me for coming years.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since significant numbers of offices for purchase appeared in New York in the 1980s, perhaps their largest market has been nonprofit organizations buying for tax reasons, said David Lebenstein, a senior managing director and principal with the commercial real estate brokerage Cassidy Turley. Owning space also provides continuity for nonprofit groups, which can have fluctuating income and often risk being priced out of rental buildings, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Still, I'd say that of the 20 nonprofits that ask me for an analysis of buying versus leasing, about one of those 20 winds up buying,'' said Mr. Lebenstein, who specializes in nonprofit organizations. ''And that's probably appropriate. There are advantages and disadvantages to buying.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market for office condominiums could expand if changes in business accounting rules proposed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board are enacted, said Douglas P. Heller, a partner and condominium specialist with the law firm Herrick, Feinstein. Businesses would have to list their annual rent as an expense or liability, Mr. Heller said; rent is currently a footnote on their balance sheet. The companies would also list an office purchase as an expense or liability, but they would also record it as an asset, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lebenstein said that companies had been weighing the effects of such accounting changes, but also that the changes were still far from certain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of people are expecting to see more corporate buyers of either large blocks of condo space or of entire buildings,'' he said. ''But that's a couple of years away, and it's more prediction than reality at this point.''</p>

</div><div class="author">By KEITH SCHNEIDER   </div><div>1101 words</div><div>25 May 2011</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TOLEDO, Ohio -- Before it became known as the Marina District, the 128 acres of tall grass and dirt piles on the Maumee River here was home to one of the city's most prominent eyesores, the Acme coal-fired power plant, which was decommissioned in 1994.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adjoining the riverfront parcel is the Docks, a 69,550-square-foot formerly city-owned dining and entertainment complex that for years after it was built in 1996 was among Toledo's most popular destinations. But the recent recession hit Toledo hard, and two of the five restaurants closed this year, leaving hundreds of thousands of dollars in unpaid rent and lost tax revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The open space along the east bank of the Maumee, bounded by Front Street, Main Street and Interstate 280, appeared to be another big development challenge in one of the regions of the country hardest hit by the recession. But last fall two real estate developers from China, personally recruited by Mayor Michael P. Bell and his staff, took a look during a reciprocal visit to this city of 287,000 residents and saw an opportunity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On March 18, the two investors, Yuan Xiaohona and Wu Kin Hung, closed on the $2.15 million purchase of the Docks and the adjacent five acres of parking lots. In an interview, Mayor Bell, a 56-year-old independent elected in 2009, said he and other city leaders thought the deal would eventually lead to a much larger project: the sale of the adjoining 69 acres to Ms. Yuan and Mr. Wu, who said in a signed memorandum in February that they intended to build a new riverfront residential, office, retail and entertainment district.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They've moved forward to say what they are going to do,'' said Mr. Bell, an outsize bachelor who played linebacker at the University of Toledo, rides a Harley and favors pink ostrich cowboy boots and matching pink ties. ''A huge portion of what is happening and will happen is based on the trust we've developed. The purchase of the Docks is Step 1. It shows we have energy, and we have direction.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">R. Scott Prephan, a real estate consultant who introduced Mayor Bell to Ms. Yuan and Mr. Wu during a trip to China in September, said engineering studies had started. He showed a reporter some of the first architectural drawings, which envisioned a low-rise assembly of modern multi- and single-family residences, office buildings and retail spaces surrounded by parks and the Maumee waterfront. The intent of the development, he said, is to serve as a kind of staging area for international executives to conduct business in the Midwest, a lively urban neighborhood for their spouses and children, and a destination for shopping and dining for residents of the Toledo region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The concept is very strong,'' Mr. Prephan said, ''and the market will support this kind of idea.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Yuan and Mr. Wu, the principals in their newly organized Dashing Pacific Group, have expressed ardent enthusiasm for the project. Ms. Yuan wrote in the February memorandum, signed by her and Mr. Bell, that the company's goal was to ''work diligently to prepare an offer to purchase the Marina District and share with you our vision for its development.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Yuan, who was not available for an interview, has visited Toledo twice, most recently in late March when she met newly elected Gov. John Kasich, a Republican, who said he supported the project. Mr. Wu visited Toledo in October and sent Jimmy Wu, his son who lives in New York, to the meeting with Mr. Kasich.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate professionals here estimated that the investment by Ms. Yuan and Mr. Wu could total $200 million to $300 million. That would make it one of the largest real estate investments in the United States by Chinese developers, and part of a steadily growing number of Chinese-financed projects in small urban American markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the research company <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>, aside from two big office building investments in New York for $900 million, the largest Chinese investment last year was the $90 million purchase of the Sheraton Universal hotel in North Hollywood, Calif., by the Shenzhen New World Group. The largest real estate purchase in the Midwest last year by Chinese investors, according to <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>, was the $7.2 million that the Shenzhen BRC Development Company paid for a 120,500-square-foot mall in South Bend, Ind. The companies are not related.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What's remarkable in a good way about the Toledo deal is historically when people think about investors from China, they focused on the major markets -- New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles,'' said Spencer Levy, the executive managing director of CB Richard Ellis Capital Markets, who is based in Washington. ''But we're starting to find significant interest from China in what people would consider secondary markets, and in asset classes that are not stable and do not have long-term leases.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan for the Marina District and the sale of the Docks set off a small xenophobic response from some Toledo residents. ''There were a few letters and a few blogs that took issue with our selling riverfront property to the Chinese or any foreign investor,'' said Thomas S. Crothers, the deputy mayor for external relations. ''Our job, though, is to bring investment from domestic or foreign sources to revitalize our community.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, many business executives here praised the deal. ''Business people have been very supportive,'' said Ford Weber, the president and chief executive of the Lucas County Improvement Corporation, an economic development group. ''It's an opportunity to take a vacant, tax-dead property and make it a contributor to a better quality of life, a stronger economy and a broader tax base.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city has been trying for years to develop the Marina District, the site of a $42 million toxic waste cleanup that was completed in 2007. The city also spent four years marketing the Docks to retire a $1.66 million bond and bring in revenue to help reduce a budget deficit that this year will reach $4.85 million. The $2.15 million that Dashing Pacific Group paid for the restaurant complex will net Toledo about $300,000, city officials said.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- New single-family home sales rose for a second consecutive month in April and the supply was the lowest in a year, but a surplus of previously owned homes continued to weigh on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said sales increased 7.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 323,000 units, the highest level since December, while prices also rose. Economists had expected a 300,000-unit rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All four regions recorded gains in sales, with the West reporting a 15.1 percent rise. Compared with April last year, however, sales were down 23.1 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Although the headline figure has moved sharply on a month-to-month basis, reflecting in part the impact of harsh weather in earlier months, the bottom line is that the new-home market continues to bounce along the bottom,'' said Omair Sharif, an economist at RBS in Stamford, Conn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An oversupply of used houses and a relentless wave of foreclosed properties are curbing the market for new homes, even as builders are keeping lean inventories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A record low 175,000 new homes were available for sale last month, down 2.8 percent from the previous month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data last week showed a steep drop in new home construction in April and a decline in sales of previously owned homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's still a tremendous overhang in the housing market, and while new-home sales are starting to percolate, that doesn't change the fact that we still have such huge inventory,'' said Michael Yoshikami, chief investment strategist at Ycmnet Advisors in Walnut Creek, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the report cast a positive light on the housing market, it did little to change perceptions that the economy remained mired in a soft patch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That view was reinforced by a Richmond Federal Reserve survey showing that manufacturing activity in the central Atlantic region stalled in May, after expanding during the previous seven months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Richmond Fed's manufacturing index came in at minus 6, a contraction from the reading of plus 10 in April, dragged down by declines in shipments and new orders. A negative number indicates contraction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department report also showed that the median sales price for a new home rose 1.6 percent last month to $217,900. Compared with April last year, the median price increased 4.6 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At April's sales pace, the supply of new homes on the market dropped to 6.5 months' worth, the lowest since April last year, from 7.2 months' worth in March.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Continued worries about Europe's lingering debt crisis overshadowed a small rebound in oil prices and pushed stocks slightly lower on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oil rose $1.89, to $99.59 a barrel, after major banks raised their forecasts for crude prices. <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>, <span class="companylink">JPMorgan</span> and <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> analysts predicted a rise in global demand would drive oil prices higher later this year. Goldman analysts said oil prices could reach $135 a barrel by the end of 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks swung between gains and losses throughout the day, with <span class="companylink">Chevron</span> and other energy firms posting the largest gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones industrial average fell 25.05 points, or 0.20 percent, to 12,356.21. The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index dropped 1.09 points, or 0.08 percent, to 1,316.28. The Nasdaq composite index declined 12.74 points, or 0.46 percent, to 2,746.16.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks had been lifted in the first four months of the year by stronger earnings reports, an improving job market and other signs of economic recovery. But all three major indexes have lost more than 3.5 percent this month, even as earnings remain strong. Widespread optimism has been offset by a host of concerns, especially the effect of higher oil prices on consumer spending and the risk that debt troubles in Europe could get worse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Markets faced more troubling news about Europe on Tuesday, when Greece's main opposition party said it opposed the government's latest endeavors to reduce debt. The news further reduced hopes that the country might be able to repair its finances enough to get another loan package from the International Monetary Fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ratings agency <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> also warned that a restructuring of Greece's debt would be considered a default. That would cause borrowing costs for other debt-burdened European countries to soar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Uri Landesman, president of the hedge fund manager Platinum Partners, said a Greek default could start a chain reaction affecting larger countries like Spain, wreaking havoc on the global economy. ''If you had a Spanish default, there wouldn't be a single world bank not affected,'' Mr. Landesman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">United States banks had $187 billion at stake in Spain as of the end of last September, according to the most recent data from the Bank for International Settlements. The amount includes holdings of government debt, derivative contracts and other commitments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department reported that sales of new homes rose slightly in April, but at a rate far below what would be normal in a healthy housing market. New home sales rose to an annual rate of 323,000, from 300,000 in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The energy company El Paso rose 6.53 percent, to $20.22, after saying it planned to split itself into two publicly traded businesses by the end of this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">AutoZone</span> rose 6 percent, to $293.30, after the specialty retailer's earnings jumped 12 percent on strong sales of its Duralast auto parts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Medtronic</span> fell 1 percent, to $40.88, after its earnings fell short of forecasts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Treasury's 10-year note rose 4/32 to 100 3/32. The yield fell to 3.11 percent, from 3.13 percent late Monday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The party, in a triplex loft floating high above the East River, was just getting started a little after 6 p.m. on Wednesday. The models, leggy young women dressed in Nina Ricci, Proenza Schouler and Calvin Klein, had started to circulate as waiters came through with trays of canapes like smoked salmon topped with glistening orange roe. A jazz quartet kept up a steady rhythm from under the stairs as guests milled about, exclaiming over the panoramic views through four enormous, synchronized glass clocks set in the tower walls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But over by the door, the evening's hostesses were tied in a vibrating knot of anxiety, trailed by a television crew as they paced in heels with phones glued to their ears and fretted about the rain. They were real estate agents trying to drum up excitement for what could become the most expensive apartment in all of Brooklyn -- if it sells at the right price -- and frantically working to arrange cars to ferry missing brokers over to Dumbo from Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's very hard to get people here just to look at it -- they won't come,'' said Michele Kleier of Gumley Haft Kleier, which is marketing the 6,800-square-foot apartment at the top of the ClockTower building at 1 Main Street. ''But if you offer them a fabulous evening,'' she added, and provide transportation, maybe you can get enough people who know other people willing to shell out $23.5 million for a trophy apartment, with its own glass-walled elevator, crow's nest deck and catering-inspired kitchen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the party, an event that has become almost de rigueur as a luxury marketing tool, was notable for more than the lengths to which Ms. Kleier and her daughters, executive vice presidents of her agency, had gone. It was also an embodiment of the intersection of real estate and reality TV, a junction where the proliferation of shows turning a voyeuristic eye on the gaining and shedding of expensive homes has injected a higher dose of showmanship into the marketing strategy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, the ClockTower party, taped for the half-hour series the agency regularly is featured on, HGTV's ''Selling New York,'' became an art-and-commerce version of the serpent eating its tail. Asher Abehsera, managing director for residential properties at Two Trees, which developed the building and much of Dumbo, said he had been impressed by a segment on the show featuring Ms. Kleier's marketing of the Stanhope on Fifth Avenue and asked her to take on the ClockTower, which went on the market in 2009 for $25 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Very successful brokers are really about selling real estate, and it's very much all day, all night -- it's part of what they do,'' said Shari Levine, senior vice president for production at Bravo, which is shooting another reality series, a New York version of its Los Angeles-based ''Million Dollar Listing,'' which will follow the work and personal lives of three brokers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Selling New York'' follows a revolving groups of brokers from three agencies. The brokers are paid honorariums for their appearances, enough for ''a decent dinner'' out, said Courtney Campbell, who oversees the program at JV Productions, the company that took it to HGTV.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ms. Kleier and her daughters, Sabrina Kleier-Morgenstern and Samantha Kleier-Forbes, say it has brought them clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frederick Peters, president of Warburg Realty Partnership, who also appears in the series, sees the benefits differently.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It would be hard for me to say that we now have more listings because of that,'' he said. ''But inevitably, over time, having more people know about your company and see that we do a thorough and professional job translates into more calls, more business.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some in the business see no benefit at all, and caution that many of the so-called new clients are actually more interested in being on television than in buying or selling property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think it is much more about someone -- whether it's a buyer, a seller or a broker on there -- about their 15 minutes of fame than anything else,'' said Hall F. Willkie, president of Brown Harris Stevens, adding that buyers at the highest end want more, rather than less, privacy about their interests and purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Willkie said the shows reached a vast audience, but not an audience of buyers. ''No one looking for real estate in New York City -- not a soul -- turns on reality TV to find their property,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back at the party, though, things had picked up. A mix of brokers, publicists, business professionals and artistic types, like the clothing designer Yeohlee Teng and her partner, the architect Joerg Schwartz, were crowded onto the main level and wandering upstairs. Andrew Rothstein, one of the ''Selling New York'' directors, hovered behind the cameras, listening through an earpiece to what the Kleier women were saying as they squired guests around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're looking to capture real moments, real stuff,'' he said. ''Someone could come up and say, 'I want to make an offer.' We want to know right away. Then we want to grab and interview them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few feet away, a man resembling a slighter version of the rapper Fat Joe -- who identified himself as Pablo Escobar Jr., though the family of the slain drug lord has labeled him a fraud -- took in the view, one he said made the price ''not bad,'' along with his companions. They included Brittany Andrews, a former adult film actress -- ''I'm a two-time Hall of Fame porn star!'' she volunteered -- who said she now made mainstream movies and was considering the space as a film location. Later the group attracted attention as they posed for pictures with Richard Garcia, a Tupac Shakur impersonator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of the night, as the caterers loaded glassware into pink plastic racks and the models had changed out of their designer garb from Edit boutique on the Upper East Side, the Kleiers seemed to be breathing a collective sigh of relief.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was horrible weather; I was so nervous when I first got here because I was like, where are the people? Now it's packed,'' Michele Kleier said. ''The party is over, and nobody's leaving. There are still people here, so yes, I'm happy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She paused. ''I'll be happier when I sell it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Online Correction: May 23, 2011, Monday</p>

</div><div class="author">By ERIC DASH </div><div>1253 words</div><div>23 May 2011</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EL MIRAGE, Ariz. -- The nation's biggest banks and mortgage lenders have steadily amassed real estate empires, acquiring a glut of foreclosed homes that threatens to deepen the housing slump and create a further drag on the economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All told, they own more than 872,000 homes as a result of the groundswell in foreclosures, almost twice as many as when the financial crisis began in 2007, according to RealtyTrac, a real estate data provider. In addition, they are in the process of foreclosing on an additional one million homes and are poised to take possession of several million more in the years ahead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five years after the housing market started teetering, economists now worry that the rise in lender-owned homes could create another vicious circle, in which the growing inventory of distressed property further depresses home values and leads to even more distressed sales. With the spring home-selling season under way, real estate prices have been declining across the country in recent months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It remains a heavy weight on the banking system,'' said Mark Zandi, the chief economist of <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics. ''Housing prices are falling, and they are going to fall some more.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, economists project that it would take about three years for lenders to sell their backlog of foreclosed homes. As a result, home values nationally could fall 5 percent by the end of 2011, according to <span class="companylink">Moody's</span>, and rise only modestly over the following year. Regions that were hardest hit by the housing collapse and recession could take even longer to recover -- dealing yet another blow to a still-struggling economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although sales have picked up a bit in the last few weeks, banks and other lenders remain overwhelmed by the wave of foreclosures. In Atlanta, lenders are repossessing eight homes for each distressed home they sell, according to March data from RealtyTrac. In Minneapolis, they are bringing in at least six foreclosed homes for each they sell, and in once-hot markets like Chicago and Miami, the ratio still hovers close to two to one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the housing implosion, the inflow and outflow figures were typically one-to-one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reasons for the backlog include inadequate staffs and delays imposed by the lenders because of investigations into foreclosure practices. The pileup could lead to $40 billion in additional losses for banks and other lenders as they sell houses at steep discounts over the next two years, according to Trepp, a real estate research firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These shops are under siege; it's just a tsunami of stuff coming in,'' said Taj Bindra, who oversaw <span class="companylink">Washington Mutual</span>'s servicing unit from 2004 to 2006 and now advises financial institutions on risk management. ''Lenders have a strong incentive to clear out inventory in a controlled and timely manner, but if you had problems on the front end of the foreclosure process, it should be no surprise you are having problems on the back end.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A drive through the sprawling subdivisions outside Phoenix shows the ravages of the real estate collapse. Here in this working-class neighborhood of El Mirage, northwest of Phoenix, rows of small stucco homes sprouted up during the boom. Now block after block is pockmarked by properties with overgrown shrubs, weeds and foreclosure notices tacked to the doors. About 116 lender-owned homes are on the market or under contract in El Mirage, according to local real estate listings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that's just a small fraction of what is to come. An additional 491 houses are either sitting in the lenders' inventory or are in the foreclosure process. On average, homes in El Mirage sell for $65,300, down 75 percent from the height of the boom in July 2006, according to the Cromford Report, a Phoenix-area real estate data provider. Real estate agents and market analysts say those ultra-cheap prices have recently started attracting first-time buyers as well as investors looking for several properties at once.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders have also been more willing to let distressed borrowers sidestep foreclosure by selling homes for a loss. That has accelerated the pace of sales in the area and even caused prices to slowly rise in the last two months, but realty agents worry about all the distressed homes that are coming down the pike.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My biggest fear right now is that the supply has been artificially restricted,'' said Jayson Meyerovitz, a local broker. ''They can't just sit there forever. If so many houses hit the market, what is going to happen then?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The major lenders say they are not deliberately holding back any foreclosed homes. They say that a long sales process can stigmatize a property and ratchet up maintenance and other costs. But they also do not want to unload properties in a fire sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If we are out there undercutting prices, we are contributing to the downward spiral in market values,'' said Eric Will, who oversees distressed home sales for <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. ''We want to make sure we are helping stabilize communities.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest reason for the backlog is that it takes longer to sell foreclosed homes, currently an average of 176 days -- and that's after the 400 days it takes for lenders to foreclose. After drawing government scrutiny over improper foreclosures practices last fall, many big lenders have slowed their operations in order to check the paperwork, and in two dozen or so states they halted them for months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conscious of their image, many lenders have recently started telling real estate agents to be more lenient to renters who happen to live in a foreclosed home and give them extra time to move out before changing the locks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''<span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> has sent me back knocking on doors two or three times, offering to give renters money if they cooperate with us,'' said Claude A. Worrell, a longtime real estate agent from Minneapolis who specializes in selling bank-owned property. ''It's a lot different than it used to be.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Realty agents and buyers say the lenders are simply overwhelmed. Just as lenders were ill-prepared to handle the flood of foreclosures, they do not have the staff and infrastructure to manage and sell this much property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the major lenders outsourced almost every part of the process, be it sales or repairs. Some agents complain that lender-owned home listings are routinely out of date, that properties are overpriced by as much as 10 percent, and that lenders take days or longer to accept an offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The silver lining for home lenders, however, is that the number of new foreclosures and recent borrowers falling behind on their payments by three months or longer is shrinking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If they are able to manage through the next 12 to 18 months,'' said Mr. Zandi, the <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics economist, ''they will be in really good shape.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AS technology makes it easier for workers to do their jobs from home, buyers and renters in New York are seeking dedicated space where they can install a computer, a comfortable swivel chair and a desk, and block out productivity-sapping distractions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market is responding with places to set up shop in your pajamas. Windowless rooms that in the past might have been used as bedrooms -- though not legally -- are now advertised straight out as offices in older conversions, many of them former commercial buildings in the financial district. And some new construction floor plans now include rooms designed from scratch as offices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The world is not on a 9-to-5 calendar,'' said Susan de Franca, the president of Related Sales, which next month will start selling condominiums at One MiMa Tower on West 42nd Street. Of the 151 condos, 22 have areas labeled as home offices. They have windows and are large enough to be legal bedrooms, but Ms. de Franca's team decided to sell them as offices: ''We're designating them as home offices because that's appealing to our buyers,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, in eight of the two-bedroom apartments at L Haus, a Long Island City condo, a small windowed room that could be a legal bedroom is designated as a home office. Only one has been released to the market: No. 4H, which has 1,432 square feet of space and is priced at $920,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Industry, another new condo in Long Island City, 11 of the 76 apartments have spaces designated as home offices. Apartments have white oak flooring and gray oak cabinets, and the building offers a landscaped roof terrace. Units with home offices start at $525,000; No. 6F, a model unit with one of the two-bedrooms furnished as a spacious office, is selling for $829,500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home offices are in 21 apartments at the Sheffield, built in 1978 but renovated over the past six years, with sales beginning last year. Four of these are for sale. Unit 56D, a 1,498-square-foot two-bedroom listed at $2.95 million, has an office nook off the living room that receives plenty of light from the floor-to-ceiling windows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Unit 42S, price tag $1.345 million, one of the three bedrooms has been configured as an office, with a wraparound desk and open shelving -- and, as a bonus, a close-up view of the Hearst building. Unit 51Q1, $1.405 million, is an 875-square-foot one-bedroom with a windowless office area off the living/dining area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mercedes House at 555 West 53rd Street, developed by Two Trees Management Company and designed by Enrique Norten, offers five rental apartments with home offices, in inside corners of the Z-shaped building, where a legal bedroom wasn't possible. The one-bedrooms with home offices start at $3,600 a month, and two-bedrooms start at $3,900.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Walentas, the founder and principal of Two Trees, said that home offices were more prevalent in residential conversions in Dumbo, which his company was instrumental in developing. ''You have these deep windowless spaces that are ideal for home offices,'' Mr. Walentas said. ''A lot of people work at home and use them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, at Gair 2, a building in Dumbo that Two Trees also developed, 34 of 106 units are one-bedrooms with home offices, starting at $2,900 per month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And at Griffin Court, a new development at 454 West 54th Street, 42 of the 95 units have ''dens'' -- nooks with open doorways that are often used as home offices, said Kenneth Horn, the president of Alchemy Properties, the developer of Griffin Court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dens are near bathrooms, making the space even more useful. And many of the units also offer terraces that look out onto a private courtyard. The dens were included to attract buyers looking for more space without the added cost of an extra bedroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We wanted to keep as many units below a million as possible,'' Mr. Horn said. ''We decided that the ones with the dens would be more salable than your straight twos.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keith Wang and Katherine Sayn-Wittgenstein bought their three-bedroom penthouse near Gramercy Park in 2007 for the sun that streamed in from the enormous skylight over the living room and kitchen, and for the roof deck that stretched for more than 1,000 square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple were buying a place to live, and didn't realize that the apartment, at 233 East 17th Street, would become their office, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, Ms. Sayn-Wittgenstein, who sells Web conferencing software, took a job that allowed her to work at home, so they converted the bedroom off the kitchen -- separated from the other sleeping areas -- to a home office. Soon after that, Mr. Wang started his own company in the stem-cell industry and began sharing the office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We love the flexibility of working from home,'' Mr. Wang said. ''It lets us have a great work-life balance.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The small room has two desks, a bookshelf, plenty of artwork and two windows, which were especially important.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With the two of us working in such close quarters, they make it feel a little bit more spacious,'' Mr. Wang said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple are moving to Boston and are selling the apartment for $3 million, through Tamir Shemesh at Corcoran.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most spaces advertised as ''home offices'' are alcoves or windowless rooms that cannot legally be called bedrooms. The New York State Multiple Dwelling Law says rooms for sleeping must have at least 80 square feet of floor space, no measurement less than 8 feet, and window area that measures at least 12 square feet and is also at least a 10th of the area of the room. There are also rules about how much space needs to be between the window and the next lot. In addition, there are exceptions to this rule for some older buildings, according to an official at the New York City Department of Buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A room that falls outside these parameters is given another name -- media room, den, library, dining room -- but more and more these days it becomes the home office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers looking for home offices will find plenty in the office-to-residential conversions in the financial district. The buildings, which include 75 Wall Street, 20 Pine Street, 40 Broad Street and 15 Broad Street, among many others, can have layouts of up to 100 feet deep, said John Cetra, a founding principal of CetraRuddy Architects, which designed L Haus and redesigned the Sheffield. Because the windowless spaces in the middle of these buildings cannot be used as bedrooms, homeowners often use them as offices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a good way to utilize the deep floors in ways that are interesting, and to take advantage of that space,'' Mr. Cetra said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Generally apartments with office space are significantly less expensive than comparable ones with an additional legal bedroom. In a report released in January by Platinum Properties, rents for studios with home offices in the financial district were almost 10 percent lower than those for one-bedrooms -- yet the units were more than 5 percent larger, on average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When someone can't really afford a one-bedroom and they don't want a studio,'' said Khashy Eyn, the president of Platinum Properties, ''it's a dream come true.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 20 Pine, a former bank building, a 1,372-square-foot studio with an office is listed with Warburg for $1.065 million, whereas a 1,185-square-foot one-bedroom is listed for $1.65 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That studio is made up of a ''great room'' with the kitchen 30 feet away from the window, as well as a spacious windowless room designated as a ''study'' on the floor plan. The study has a large closet and is near the front door.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's large enough to be a two-bedroom, but it's a studio with a home office,'' said Deborah DeMaria of Warburg, the sales director for 20 Pine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to New York City zoning rules, up to one quarter (or 500 square feet, whichever is less) of any apartment may be used for a ''home occupation,'' which includes most desk jobs -- though not interior decorating, real estate, insurance and selling stocks, among other professions. Generally speaking, said Michael Slattery, a senior vice president of the Real Estate Board of New York, occupations that are perceived to generate noise, odor or too much pedestrian traffic are not permitted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In parts of Lower Manhattan, up to half an apartment can be used for a home occupation, and up to three outside employees can work there. A broader range of occupations is allowed, as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three employees in a home might seem like a crowd, but not in No. 1A at 7 Dutch Street, a ground-floor apartment in the financial district. The 3,400-square-foot two-bedroom three-bathroom duplex loft includes a 1,200-square-foot office in the basement with a separate entrance and a bathroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The newly renovated apartment has exposed brick and high-end kitchen appliances. Though the office receives little natural light and the shape is narrow, $1.539 million for a live/work apartment of that size is quite a find, said the broker, Javier Lattanzio of Time Equities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Working from a home office can be a money-saving proposition. Not only may the owner apply business funds toward the purchase of the apartment, but he or she may also deduct the proportionate amount of common charges and utilities as a business expense. The usual benefits of homeownership apply, too, in that the mortgage interest is tax-deductible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you're paying commercial rent, you get no depreciation, and you get no opportunity for appreciation,'' said Roberta Axelrod, the director of residential sales and rentals for Time Equities. ''And of course, you're living at home and not spending time commuting.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The important thing with a home office, Mr. Wang said, is to find a way, at the day's end, to close that office door -- whether or not there is one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've had to set boundaries in terms of when we're working and when we're not,'' he said. ''Otherwise you find yourself working 15 hours a day. You get up, you check e-mail. You go to bed, you check e-mail.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But working at home allows him and Ms. Sayn-Wittgenstein to raise their year-old child instead of having to hire a full-time nanny. ''We are certain we'll never regret spending more time with our daughter,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: May 29, 2011, Sunday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about spaces that can be used as home offices misstated the minimum square footage of floor space required by New York State law for a room used for sleeping. It is 80, not 132. (Exceptions to this rule are allowed for some older buildings.)</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carl Richards is a certified financial planner in Park City, Utah. His sketches are archived here on the Bucks blog and on his personal Web site, BehaviorGap.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a rough first quarter for the housing market. While home sales were up 11.3 percent in March over February, they were down 21 percent compared to over a year ago. And home values, well, they dropped again. Besides the difficulties with getting credit, people are just uncomfortable buying real estate right now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compare this to the mid 2000's when everyone was a real estate investor. Back then, multifamily properties had multiple offers the day they hit the market, and being a real estate investor seem like a sure thing. After years of being scared away, more and more people started to think about real estate as an ''easy'' investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buying distressed properties might be tempting now, and it very well could be a good idea. But it is far from a sure thing. Just because something has fallen 40 to 50 percent doesn't mean it can't fall further or stay down for a very long time. There is, in fact, evidence that the housing market has further to fall. And investing in real estate requires skill and careful analysis, not just a kit you buy on late-night TV.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I don't have anything personal against real estate. It may be a legitimate part of your investing strategy. The problem happens when investors don't stop to do the math.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Too often, investors get sucked into the buying things they shouldn't when they fail to add up the real costs. In the case of real estate, how much in property tax, upkeep and insurance will that ''sure thing'' cost you? How much time will be required, and what is that worth?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real real estate investors take the time to make sure buying an investment property will ''pencil'' before they buy it, and they pass on plenty of deals that won't work. There are lots of calculators that can help, including the one here at the Times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the point is that no matter how cool it might seem to buy distressed real estate at this particular moment, if you lack the skill and experience, you might want to consider a certificate of deposit. At least there you won't lose money, and with the time you save, you could focus on earning a side income or just enjoying your life.</p>

</div><div class="author">By REUTERS   </div><div>625 words</div><div>18 May 2011</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Factory output slipped for the first time in 10 months in April as a shortage of parts from Japan crimped activity and home building slumped, showing the economy got off to a weak start in the second quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a sluggish start,'' said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics in West Chester, Pa. ''Since the beginning of this year the recovery seems to have hit a bit of a soft patch, but conditions should improve for the remainder of this year.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturing output fell 0.4 percent, breaking nine consecutive months of gains, as supply disruptions from Japan's earthquake hit auto production, the Federal Reserve said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Overall industrial production was flat, with gains in mining and utilities offsetting the drop in factory output. Excluding cars and parts, manufacturing output rose a sluggish 0.2 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report from the Commerce Department showed groundbreaking for new housing dropped 10.6 percent to an annual rate of 523,000 units as a glut of homes on the market discouraged new projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though March's housing starts were revised up substantially, it was not enough to soften the blow from last month's drop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The recovery in the housing sector is still wanting and is still a hope more than a reality,'' said Anthony Chan, chief economist at <span class="companylink">JPMorgan</span> Private Wealth Management in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists, who had expected starts to rise to a 568,000-unit rate, said tornadoes that lashed parts of the country last month were partly to blame for the drop. Starts in the tornado-ravaged South slumped to a two-year low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hopes are high that gasoline prices will fall and the nascent labor market recovery will strengthen enough to increase consumer spending and economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturing has been leading the recovery and economists expect it to bounce back as auto supply disruptions fade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing, however, is a different matter. Construction is being crowded out by a surplus of homes and in particular foreclosed properties that sell well below their value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, the spread between the prices of new and previously owned houses was about $54,200, indicating used homes were selling well below the cost of construction. A spread of between $20,000 and $30,000 is generally viewed as ideal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report on Monday showed that while builders expected a modest improvement in sales during the spring, they expect market conditions to weaken in the next six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts estimate there are between eight and nine million homes on the market, including the so-called shadow inventory -- foreclosed properties and those that are about to be repossessed by banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The shadow housing inventory is coming to the market and is hindering the need to really start building more houses,'' Mr. Chan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The weight on the economy will be limited, however, since residential construction accounts for only about 2.2 percent of gross domestic product.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Groundbreaking last month was depressed by a 24.1 percent tumble in the volatile multifamily homes sector, where starts for buildings with five or more units dropped 28.3 percent. Single-family home construction fell 5.1 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Permits for future home construction dropped 4.0 percent to a 551,000-unit pace last month. They were held down by an 8.8 percent drop in the multifamily segment. Permits to build single-family homes slipped 1.8 percent.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There may not be anything to be done about the sad state of the home-building industry. They built too many homes before; now they are building very few. But the numbers released on Tuesday are still a stark reminder of the weakness of a large section of the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the 12 months through April, there were 430,000 single family homes started. That figure is the lowest since the figures were first tallied in 1960, and it is down 75 percent from the peak of 1.7 million, set just five years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In early 2010, there had seemed to be a little bit of a revival. The total for the 12 months ending in October 2009 was 437,100 -- until now the lowest ever -- but the figure rallied to 503,200 in the 12 months through May 2010. Credit has eased a bit, and there was a little optimism engendered by the temporary tax credit for home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now we are back to setting new lows, and tight credit is not the reason. Lack of demand is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I prefer to look at actual starts over 12-month periods rather than the seasonally adjusted annual rates that the Census Bureau emphasizes in its releases. If you want to compare one month with the next, you need seasonal adjustments, but weather often means you can't tell what is real and what is not. Looking at 12-month totals means that some noise is eliminated at the expense of a delay in seeing trends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The picture is not as grim in multifamily starts. There the 12-month totals are slowly rising. They are still low by historical standards, but are well above the recession lows. If fewer people own homes, more may choose to live in apartments. (The annual rate fell in February, leaped in March and fell in April. Those changes are largely related to weather and thus not worth the attention they got.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy overinvested in housing during the bubble. There is no reason to invest a lot in it now. But construction workers can build other things. We underinvested in many types of infrastructure, and now would be an ideal time to use the slack in the construction industry to rectify that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But of course we will not. Governments are cutting back. It isn't easy to come up with money to fix schools, or build new ones, when teachers are being laid off.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keep the Pictures on the Fridge, Please</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QMy condominium board recently added a house rule that states, ''Do not post anything in windows exposed to the street.'' It is now threatening to fine me if I do not remove my 5-year-old child's artwork from the window. Is this enforceable?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A ''It is difficult for a condominium unit owner to successfully challenge a house rule adopted by the board of managers,'' said Arthur I. Weinstein, a Manhattan lawyer who is vice president of the Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums. He says the courts give boards latitude under the ''business judgment rule.'' Basically, Mr. Weinstein said, the rule means that courts will not second-guess a board decision, provided that the decision was authorized under the condo's governing documents; has a legitimate relationship to the welfare of the condo; and was made in good faith. And it is likely that a board-imposed rule designed to maintain the appearance of the building, without singling out particular owners, would be protected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Billing a Tenant for Legal Expenses</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QCan a management company bill rent-stabilized tenants for legal fees for court actions that are settled before trial?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Dean G. Belmont, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, said that most rent-stabilized leases contain a provision allowing the landlord to collect legal fees from the tenant if the landlord is the ''prevailing party.'' So if a landlord takes a tenant to court and wins the case, the landlord can ask the court to order the tenant to pay his legal costs. If the case is settled out of court, it will depend on whether the settlement agreement includes a provision that the tenant pay the landlord's legal expenses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No Guarantees on Code Compliance</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QIs there a law in New York City that requires a seller to give a prospective buyer a certificate of occupancy that indicates the property is in compliance with local codes?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A ''There is no such requirement,'' said Adam Leitman Bailey, a Manhattan real estate lawyer. ''For better or worse, 'let the buyer beware' continues to be the guiding principle.'' He said that although the state's Property Condition Disclosure Act requires the seller of a house (but not a co-op or condo apartment) to provide a buyer with a statement detailing the condition of the property, the penalty for failing to provide the statement is only $500. ''So most sellers never provide the disclosure statement and give the buyer a $500 credit at the closing,'' Mr. Bailey said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QWhat is a mechanic's lien? And how does it affect my property?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A ''A mechanic's lien is a creature of statute,'' said C. Jaye Berger, a Manhattan lawyer who specializes in construction matters. It allows certain types of contractors who have improved a home, but who have not been paid, to file a lien against the property in the public records with the clerk in the relevant community. Those who can file these liens include licensed contractors and architects. Those who cannot include unlicensed contractors and interior designers. If a lien had been filed against the property, it would have to be addressed before any sale could go through.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FORECLOSED homes don't show very well -- financially strained borrowers may ignore maintenance; lenders turn off the water and power to cut the cost of letting the place sit. A poor appearance can complicate financing, but it doesn't prevent sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of what people call foreclosed homes are being sold by lenders saddled with a property because there were no other takers at the foreclosure auction. The borrower on such a house owes more on it than the house is worth. These are known as R.E.O. houses, short for ''real estate owned'' on a bank's balance sheet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Distressed properties -- those sold at a discount -- made up 40 percent of resales in March, up from 35 percent a year earlier, according to the National Association of Realtors. (That includes not only R.E.O. but also short sales, in which a buyer pays less than the loan balance, once it gets the bank's blessing.) Though not a record, it is a huge portion of sales compared with what used to be considered normal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where the money comes from depends on the buyer and the property. If a house was in relatively good physical shape -- with water and power turned on -- it could be eligible for standard financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Otherwise, right now, all-cash sales are at their highest level ever -- 35 percent of total sales, according to the Realtors. Cash buyers, often investors who don't plan to live in the home, ''are a major player in the R.E.O. market,'' said Tom McGiveron of Realty Connect in Hauppauge, N.Y., a real estate agent who specializes in foreclosures on Long Island. ''Asset managers want to move their portfolios as fast as possible,'' he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For would-be owner-occupants without cash, the federally insured 203(k) loan is key, said Mark Yecies, the president of SunQuest Funding in Cranford, N.J. Borrowers can roll projected rehab costs into the loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Mr. McGiveron put it, ''Since most R.E.O.'s are as is, and the heat, plumbing and electric are turned off frequently, a 203(k) loan is necessary to cover the borrower and the lender -- a lender will not lend money on a home where the major heating and electrical systems are not operable.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers generally hire an independent consultant certified by the Federal Housing Administration to review contractor cost estimates and architectural plans for things like whether the work will bring the property up to minimum standards while not going overboard on improvements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In other words,'' Mr. Yecies said, ''if you're buying a home in Newark and you want to put in a Viking range, it's not going to happen.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet in a higher-priced neighborhood like Short Hills, N.J., he added, you probably would be able to borrow for more upscale appliances. The F.H.A. appraiser takes the consultant's report into account when reviewing a property and determining how big the loan can be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all R.E.O. properties are eligible, Mr. Yecies pointed out. For instance, a partially built house that has never had a certificate of occupancy requires a construction loan of the kind that a commercial developer would use.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Yecies estimated that an F.H.A-certified consultant would cost $500 to $1,200, depending on the extent of the repairs and the number of units in a property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The interest rate on a 203(k) loan is about a quarter of a percentage point higher than on a standard F.H.A.-insured loan, and a buyer also can expect to pay 1 or 2 points, he said. (A point is an upfront charge equivalent to 1 percent of the loan amount.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As with other F.H.A.-backed loans, down payments may be as low as 3.5 percent, and loan limits apply. Currently, most F.H.A. loans in the area are capped at $729,750. (Energy-efficient rehabs may be eligible for more.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the extra steps, these loans work, Mr. Yecies said. ''We're doing a half dozen a month here,'' he said. ''They can be done in a normal period of time, as long as everyone cooperates.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many middle-class Americans, it is the most coveted brand in real estate, synonymous with sky-piercing luxury and can't-miss quality: Donald J. Trump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Far from the New York City towers that bear his name, in cities like Tampa, Fla., and Philadelphia, house hunters clamor to buy into his developments, sometimes exhausting credit lines and wiping out savings for a chance to own a piece of his gilded empire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as Mr. Trump, who is weighing a bid for the White House, has zealously sought to cash in on his name, he has entered into arrangements that home buyers describe as deliberately deceptive -- designed, they said, to exploit the very thing that drew them to his buildings: their faith in him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the last few years, according to interviews and hundreds of pages of court documents, the real estate mogul has aggressively marketed several luxury high-rises as ''Trump properties'' or ''signature Trump'' buildings, with names like Trump Tower and Trump International -- even making appearances at the properties to woo buyers. The strong indication of his involvement as a developer generated waves of media attention and commanded premium prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when three of the planned buildings encountered financial trouble, it became clear that Mr. Trump had essentially rented his name to the developments and had no responsibility for their outcomes, according to buyers. In each case, he yanked his name off the projects, which were never completed. The buyers lost millions of dollars in deposits even as Mr. Trump pocketed hefty license fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who bought the apartments in part because of the Trump name were livid, saying they felt a profound sense of betrayal, and more than 300 of them are now suing Mr. Trump or his company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The last thing you ever expect is that somebody you revere will mislead you,'' said Alex Davis, 38, who bought a $500,000 unit in Trump International Hotel and Tower Fort Lauderdale, a waterfront property that Mr. Trump described in marketing materials as ''my latest development'' and compared to the Trump tower on Central Park in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There was no disclaimer that he was not the developer,'' Mr. Davis said. The building, where construction was halted when a major lender ran out of money in 2009, sits empty and unfinished, the outlines of a giant Trump sign, removed long ago, still faintly visible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Davis is unable to recover any of his $100,000 deposit -- half of which the developer used for construction costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another casualty: his admiration for Mr. Trump, whose books and television show Mr. Davis had devoured. ''I bought into an idea of him,'' he said, ''and it wasn't what I thought it was.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alan Garten, a lawyer for Mr. Trump's company, said that, regardless of what Mr. Trump himself or any marketing materials had suggested, his role was disclosed in lengthy purchasing documents that buyers should have carefully scrutinized. But in an interview, Mr. Garten acknowledged that, ''without a lawyer, it can be difficult'' to understand such documents. He suggested that the housing market collapse, not Mr. Trump, was the cause of their troubles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They are people who lost money and are looking for somebody to blame,'' Mr. Garten said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trump's Midas touch as a businessman, sometimes real, other times perceived, is central to his presidential aspirations, which have become increasingly hard for Republicans to ignore, even as some of them cringe at his blunt remarks and boastfulness. In the next month, he is scheduled to visit two key primary-season states, South Carolina and Iowa, as he further tests the waters. ''I have made myself very rich,'' he said recently, sitting in his palatial suite at the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas. ''And I would make this country very rich.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But regardless of whether Mr. Trump ultimately seeks the presidency, his attempt to promote himself as a savvy financial manager who can lead America out of its economic rut is bringing new scrutiny to his own business practices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite high-profile stumbles, like the bankruptcy of Atlantic City casinos bearing his name, Mr. Trump has nurtured plenty of successful projects, in real estate and beyond: memberships to his golf clubs sell briskly, his men's suits are a hit at <span class="companylink">Macy's</span>, and his NBC series, ''The Apprentice,'' is a ratings smash. Mr. Trump, in an interview, said the show had earned him well over $100 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet in recent years, as his brand has experienced an ''Apprentice''-fueled resurgence, it appears that Mr. Trump, 64, has taken an expansive approach to putting his name on products big and small. There are Trump mattresses, Trump ties, Trump video games, Trump bottled water and Trump chocolates (designed to resemble bars of gold, silver and copper.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it is Mr. Trump's real estate and education products that have enticed many Americans to invest life savings and dreams of quick riches. And it is with these products, according to a string of lawsuits and complaints filed around the country, that Mr. Trump has disappointed his fans most deeply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Opening a 'University'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the American housing market climbed toward its peak, in 2005, Mr. Trump opened a for-profit school, called Trump University, to impart his wisdom about real estate and moneymaking to the general public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In marketing materials, he promised students that his handpicked team of instructors would ''teach you better than the best business school,'' according to the transcript of a Web video. The same year, Mr. Trump licensed his name to an affiliated program, called the Trump Institute, which offered similar classes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dozens of complaints about both schools have rolled into the offices of attorneys general in Florida, Texas, New York and Illinois, officials said. And last year, the Better Business Bureau gave Trump University a D-minus, the second-lowest grade on its scale, after it fielded 23 complaints.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A lawsuit filed in 2010 by four dissatisfied former students, who are seeking class-action status, accuses Trump University of offering classes that amounted to extended ''infomercials,'' ''selling nonaccredited products,'' and ''taking advantage of these troubled economic times to prey on consumers' fears.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the court papers, the university used high-pressure sales tactics to enroll students in classes that cost up to $35,000, at times encouraging them to raise their credit card limits to pay for them. It promised intensive one-on-one instruction that often failed to materialize. And its mentors recommended investments from which they stood to profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was almost completely worthless,'' said Jeffrey Tufenkian, 49, who along with his wife, Sona, enrolled in a $35,000 ''Gold Elite'' class at Trump University to jump-start a career in real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tufenkian, who lives in Portland, Ore., was especially drawn to what Trump University described as a year-long mentorship. But he said that it amounted to a real estate expert from California taking him on a tour of homes in Portland that he could have seen on his own, for free.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At one point, he said, the mentor suggested an educational trip to <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span>, an idea he found comical; at another, he said, the mentor recommended a sales technique (selling the option to buy a house), that several lawyers later told Mr. Tufenkian he was ineligible to perform because he lacked a real estate license. He recalled how, during a much cheaper Trump class on foreclosure, he and his wife were encouraged by instructors to raise their credit card limits, ostensibly in anticipation of investing in real estate, only to have the accounts maxed out with the purchase of the next $35,000 class, a charge mirrored in the lawsuit. The fee, and the resulting credit card interest payments, have wiped out much of the couple's savings. Mr. Tufenkian's requests for a refund have been rejected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You can understand how a business makes mistakes,'' he said, ''but a proper business will do what it takes to make it right. Trump University has no interest in taking care of its customers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">George Sorial, a managing director and lawyer at the <span class="companylink">Trump Organization</span>, the company that oversees Mr. Trump's various businesses, said that the school had a ''very generous'' refund policy -- and that less than two percent of students ask for their money back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sorial called claims that instructors took students on tours of <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> and asked students to raise their credit limits ''ridiculous'' and ''unsubstantiated.'' He said mentors were prohibited from profiting from their advice. According to student evaluations, he said, Trump University has a 97 percent customer satisfaction rate with its 11,000 paying students around the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I guarantee that if you went out and surveyed Harvard grads, you would find some who are not happy. It's inevitable,'' he said. ''You cannot look at the exception to the rule.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Students said the evaluations must be put into context: they were told to fill them out using their names, often in the presence of the instructors they were assessing. Mr. Tufenkian, for example, said he gave high marks to the program after his mentor told him he would not leave until Mr. Tufenkian did so. ''I had to fill it out right in front of him,'' Mr. Tufenkian said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The school has repeatedly sought to use such evaluations to raise questions about the credibility of unhappy former students. After Tarla Makaeff, who spent about $37,000 on Trump classes, joined the lawsuit against the school, the company released raw footage of a Trump University videographer approaching her in a hotel conference room, asking her to assess the program and her mentors. On the video, her mentors can be seen standing beside her, clearly within earshot. While warning that ''we just got started,'' Ms. Makaeff, 37, calls the mentors ''great'' and ''awesome.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In retrospect, Ms. Makaeff said, university employees ''were trying to cover themselves,'' by putting her on tape. Trump University is now suing her for defamation, seeking at least $1 million in damages for her public criticism of the school in letters, e-mail and online. ''That just shows you how low they will go to silence people,'' Ms. Makaeff said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The school's troubles are intensifying. Last year, the Texas attorney general, Greg Abbott, opened a civil investigation into Trump University's practices. Since then, the company has agreed not to operate in Texas indefinitely, said Thomas Kelley, a spokesman for the attorney general. (Mr. Sorial said there was no formal agreement.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And last March, New York state officials demanded that Trump University change its name, saying its use of the word university ''is misleading and violates New York education law,'' joining Maryland, which issued a similar warning in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The school has since changed its name to the Trump Entrepreneur Initiative, but has not held a new class in seven months as it reworks its curriculum. ''It's on hiatus,'' Mr. Trump said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Trump Institute, meanwhile, shut down in 2009. ''It doesn't meet our standards,'' Mr. Sorial said. ''Our standards are very high.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Selling the Name</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as his empire has expanded into reality television and the clothing aisle, Mr. Trump remains, at least in the public imagination, primarily a real estate developer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But to a remarkable degree over the last five years, Mr. Trump has retreated from that role, becoming, instead, a highly-paid licensor, who leases his five-letter brand name to other developers in Toronto, Honolulu, Dubai and even his own backyard, New York City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The arrangements allowed Mr. Trump, who is notoriously competitive, to remain a player in the world of big-city builders without risking his own money -- a prospect that seemed especially appealing as the economy began to crater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When things got over-inflated in the world,'' Mr. Trump's son Donald Jr., said in an interview, ''we removed ourselves from the ground-up development world, where we are risking a lot more.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We switched more to a license model,'' he said, describing several of the projects, including the Honolulu building, as ''big successes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However it was that kind of license deal -- in places like Baja California, Mexico, and in Tampa and Fort Lauderdale, Fla. -- that led to disappointment and anger among those seeking to buy a home carrying the Trump name, according to the lawsuits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Robbins, 62, a retired lieutenant colonel in the United States Army who is among those suing Mr. Trump, recalled being dazzled by the amenities available in the nearly 2,000-square-foot apartment that he and his wife, Rosanna, bought six years ago at the Trump Tower Tampa: granite countertops, sweeping views of the Tampa Bay, and room service from a high-end ground-floor restaurant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most important amenity of all, though, was the name on the side of the building. ''With the Trump name,'' Mr. Robbins said of his $756,000 unit, ''we thought it would be a quality building and address.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The marketing materials left little doubt that Mr. Trump was a driving force behind the 52-story tower: ''We are developing a signature landmark property,'' Mr. Trump declared in a news release unveiling it, which described him as a partner. In a marketing video, Mr. Trump called it ''my first project on the Gulf of Mexico,'' and even showed up to mingle with potential buyers at a lavish, catered event. ''I love to build buildings,'' Mr. Robbins recalled Mr. Trump telling the audience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A confidential agreement, later made public in court filings, told a different story: Mr. Trump was not one of the developers or builders. For $4 million, plus a share of any profits, he had licensed his name. As for the mingling with buyers? He was required to do it, up to two times, in the agreement, which spelled out that the appearances last ''for no more than six (6) working hours each.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the document, the very existence of the license agreement was to be kept confidential. And it remained that way, buyers said, long after they bought their units. ''If at any point I had known this, I would have walked away,'' said Mr. Robbins, who put down a deposit of about $150,000 -- half of which, under Florida law, the developer could use for construction costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A similar situation unfolded in Baja, where Mr. Trump licensed his name to another glamorous-sounding waterfront property: the Trump Ocean Resort Baja.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As financing for the building froze in 2008 and the developer missed key deadlines, Mr. Trump exercised his right to terminate the license agreement and remove his name. According to a lawsuit, the partners behind the deal burned through $32 million worth of buyer deposits, even though little, if any, construction was done.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the buyers suing Mr. Trump, Donald Isbell, said he has lain awake countless nights trying to figure out how he erred. He has lost his entire deposit of $147,000. ''I have come to the conclusion,'' he said, ''that what I did wrong was to trust Donald Trump.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trump and his advisers seem unapologetic about how they handled the three deals. Asked, in a deposition with lawyers for the Tampa buyers, if he would be responsible for any shoddy construction, Mr. Trump replied that he had ''no liability,'' and said that he was unsure whether his licensing arrangements were disclosed to buyers. Pressed during the deposition as to why he did not return his license fee after the development fell apart, Mr. Trump replied: ''Well, because I had no obligation to the people that signed me to give it back.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what has most galled people like Mr. Robbins, who sank much of their life savings into their dream homes, was Mr. Trump's suggestion that the collapse of the project was a blessing -- because it had allowed buyers to avoid the housing crash and the resulting plunge in home values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They were better off losing their deposit,'' Mr. Trump said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Better off?'' asked Mr. Robbins, who lost $75,600, the half of his deposit spent on construction. ''No. I would be better off if he had been truthful and honest with us from the beginning. I would be better off if he returned my deposit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But he will never do that. He is looking out for Donald Trump and the dollar.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate agents across the country are aggressively making the case that now is a good time to buy a house. Mortgage rates are near record lows and will probably rise in coming years. Home prices may not be done falling, but they probably don't have much further to go in most places either. Rents, on the other hand, seem set to increase, thanks to low vacancy rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Renters beware,'' warned a newsletter that I recently received from a real estate agents' group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Individually, each of these points is unobjectionable. But it's important to remember the source. Real estate agents, like mortgage brokers and home builders, have a big financial stake in persuading people to buy homes. That's why many agents are always pushing home buying, whatever the rationale of the moment happens to be.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The truth is that you can make just as strong a case in many places for renting. For starters, neither mortgage rates nor rents are likely to rise rapidly. Even more important, house prices, relative to rents, remain higher than their long-term average, especially in much of California, the Pacific Northwest and the New York region. In these places, among others, renting is often cheaper than buying -- still.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I've made a near-annual habit in this column of looking at the rent-versus-buy decision, and The Times has built an online calculator so that readers can make their own comparisons. The idea isn't only to help potential buyers but also to figure out whether and where house prices are overvalued. That question is of obvious importance to homeowners and to the American economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As this year's spring buying season nears its peak, the relative merits of renting and buying are closer than they have been since the housing bubble began inflating almost a decade ago. So the best single piece of advice for most people is to make a decision based mainly on their stage of life, rather than on any complex financial calculations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you think you are ready to settle in one place for at least five years, if not more, buying often makes a lot of sense. That's why I bought my first house, in the Washington area, a few years ago, despite thinking local prices remained high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if the chances are good that you will move again in the next few years, renting is usually the better bet. The various closing costs, including real estate agents' fees, are just too high. Owning a house also makes it much harder to move when you want to because selling a house is complicated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within this basic framework, the numbers -- specifically, something called rent ratios -- are the next place to turn. A rent ratio is the sale price of a house divided by the annual cost of renting an equivalent house. When the ratio is below 15, most people should lean toward buying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To see why, look at the Atlanta area, where the average ratio is now about 13. Combined with today's low interest rates, that ratio means that the typical monthly mortgage payment is several hundred dollars lower than the rent on an equivalent house. Over time, this difference helps make up for the other costs of owning, like closing costs and borrowing costs. And, yes, a mortgage costs money, despite the tax deduction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only if home prices in Atlanta fall further and don't recover for years would most buyers today have reason for regret. The other areas where the average ratio is below 15, according to <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics, include Los Angeles, Miami, Minneapolis, St. Louis, Las Vegas, Cleveland, Detroit, Phoenix, Pittsburgh and Tampa, Fla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other end of the spectrum are metropolitan areas where prices still look bubbly. In San Diego, the ratio was 22 at the end of last year (and most ratios have fallen only slightly since then). In northern and central New Jersey, it was 25, and it was 29 in Manhattan. In Silicon Valley and the nearby East Bay in California, the ratio was above 30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All these numbers are well down from their peaks from about five years ago. But they're still higher than they were in the decades before the housing bubble. They are also high enough to make the monthly costs of owning steeper than the costs of renting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a rule of thumb, a ratio above roughly 20 means that a monthly mortgage bill is higher than rent for a similar house. In Silicon Valley, the after-tax mortgage payment on a typical house might be $3,500 -- while the rent on the same house would be only about $2,500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The arithmetic of owning then gets mighty tough. On top of closing costs and mortgage costs, owners are also falling further behind renters each month. To make up that ground, house prices would have to rise significantly over the next few years. Does that sound like a good bet?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When you look at the numbers this way, it's easy to conclude that the excesses of the housing bubble are mostly gone in much of the country. Yet you also start wondering whether New York, San Francisco, Seattle and a few other places still have a housing crash in their future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I realize there are some important caveats here. Affluent people tend to want to own their houses, even when the dollars don't make sense, and the Northeast and West Coast are home to much more wealth than a few decades ago. That could cause future rent ratios to be higher than those in the 1990s or even the 1980s, a better decade for real estate. Meanwhile, the coming rise in rents -- maybe 4 or 5 percent a year, for the next few years -- will reduce rent ratios even if prices don't fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the fact remains that a lot of New Yorkers and Californians, among others, are paying a hefty premium for the privilege of owning. Eventually, some of them may decide it's not worth it, much as homebuyers in Las Vegas, Phoenix and Florida ultimately decided that prices were too high. If that happens, prices in New York and California will fall, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A crash strikes me as unlikely. But any potential homebuyers should know that real estate exuberance -- irrational exuberance, it seems -- has survived in at least a few places.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STAMFORD, Conn. -- When Chelsea Piers, the sports emporium on the Manhattan waterfront, began looking more than a decade ago for a location where it could expand, the hunt centered on major cities like Boston, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in the end, Chelsea Piers settled on a site far closer to home: early last month the company started construction on a 400,000-square-foot facility in Stamford. It will sit inside what is currently one of the largest industrial re-use sites in the area, a 33-acre office and manufacturing complex that once belonged to the hair products company <span class="companylink">Clairol</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chelsea Piers executives first saw -- and later bid -- on the property in 2009. David A. Tewksbury, a company co-founder, said they quickly realized it offered everything they had been unable to find elsewhere: a large, well-maintained property that was near a major highway exit (Exit 9 on Interstate 95), and also in an area where the demand for sports complexes far exceeded what was available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We were immediately taken with it,'' said Mr. Tewksbury, who is now also the president of Chelsea Piers Connecticut. ''Fairfield County is very densely populated, and it's wildly enthusiastic for sports.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company's 1.2 million-square-foot site on the Hudson River, which it opened in 1995, already attracts about four million visitors a year. Chelsea Piers hopes to draw visitors from a 20-mile radius around Stamford, a city of 122,000 in Fairfield County, which has a population of nearly 900,000. Westchester County, with about one million people, is about 15 miles to the west.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, the complex has 711,000 square feet, and consists mostly of a single-story building connected to a two-story building. It was <span class="companylink">Clairol</span>'s world headquarters for more than 40 years, and after the company was acquired by <span class="companylink">Procter &amp; Gamble</span> in 2001, it also served as <span class="companylink">Clairol</span>'s main manufacturing plant for its hair coloring products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2008, <span class="companylink">Procter &amp; Gamble</span> announced plans to put its Stamford operations elsewhere. And last year, <span class="companylink">Clairol</span> finally left, moving its manufacturing operations to various sites in the United States and Mexico, and its administrative offices to <span class="companylink">Procter &amp; Gamble</span>'s headquarters in Cincinnati.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, when the property finally changed hands, in March 2010, it went to another buyer, a partnership made up of affiliates of Spinnaker Real Estate Partners, in South Norwalk, Conn.; Steven Wise Associates, a Stamford-based real estate investment and development company; and the Connecticut Film Center, which is also based in Stamford. Together, the partners paid $17.5 million in cash for the property, after an earlier bid fell through for lack of financing, said Clayton H. Fowler, the founding partner and chief executive of Spinnaker, which has a history of remaking older industrial, as well as urban, properties in the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chelsea Piers will be an anchor tenant at the old <span class="companylink">Clairol</span> site, spending approximately $45 million on renovations. On the ground floor of the single-story building that once served as a warehouse for <span class="companylink">Clairol</span>, the company is planning to build two National Hockey League-size ice skating rinks and its first squash center, as well as an Olympic-size pool, a recreational water park, a day care center, space for food vendors and a 20,000-square-foot gymnastics center. A 40,000-square-foot mezzanine floor will sit above, offering space for events and an area to watch activities below.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plans call for adding a second floor to what is now the roof of the old warehouse building. On that floor, which will be about 160,000 square feet, Chelsea Piers plans to put up two new buildings that will together house the company's first tennis courts (seven in all), basketball courts, volleyball courts and a 60,000-square-foot playing field that can be easily divided into four smaller fields for sports like football, soccer, lacrosse, baseball and field hockey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tewksbury said the new playing fields would be almost three times as large as the two ''mini-fields'' the company now offers in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Manhattan, Chelsea Piers now also has a 150,000-square-foot health club. But in Connecticut the company wants to emphasize competitive sports; Mr. Tewksbury said the area had a shortage of space for them to be played.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Many of the local ice hockey programs in lower Fairfield County, for example, are now driving for 30 to 45 minutes to places like Shelton and beyond to get ice time, and school teams are practicing at 5:30 in the morning,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some 450,000 square feet of space still needs to be filled at <span class="companylink">Clairol</span>'s old site, especially within the large, two-story building adjacent to where Chelsea Piers is building its new quarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trip Hoffman, a senior director at Cushman &amp; Wakefield of Connecticut, said much of the industrial market in the Stamford area was made up of buildings no more than 30,000 square feet in size, so the site might appeal to tenants like data centers. But another goal is to possibly attract tenants like sports medicine physicians, physical therapists and a membership health club, to create an indoor sports mall that would essentially offer sports enthusiasts one-stop shopping.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Because of its size, and the ability to have multiple entries, this site can have multiple personalities, or users who are complementary to one another, or even a combination of both,'' said Stephen M. Wise, who heads the real estate company whose affiliate is an investor in the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Connecticut Film Center is already planning to take on space at the site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kevin Segalla, the center's founder and president, said that since Connecticut began offering a sizable tax credit in 2006 for movies and television shows produced in the state, his center has spent the last five years either acquiring or leasing 340,000 square feet of production and office space in both Stamford and South Norwalk. Plans now call for offering an additional 81,000 square feet of production space, with at least a few more soundstages, on the second floor of the building next to Chelsea Piers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Frankly there is a shortage of space like this in the Stamford area, a shortage of warehouse space that can be easily converted to production facilities,'' he said. ''Right now, we could easily add three new soundstages.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daniel Brodsky, a real estate developer, was elected chairman of the Metropolitan Museum of Art on Tuesday in a vote by the museum's board. Mr. Brodsky will assume the post on Sept. 13, succeeding James R. Houghton, who has been chairman for the past 13 years and will now become a trustee emeritus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Met trustee since 2001, Mr. Brodsky, 66, has served on important committees, including those for Finance and Buildings. He is also a trustee of New York City Ballet and New York University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Met chairmanship is one of the most prestigious positions in New York's cultural firmament, requiring someone who is politically deft, an adept fund-raiser and well liked and respected by the rest of the board. That description seemed to fit Mr. Brodsky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Met's director, Thomas P. Campbell, described him as a ''good listener, someone who really takes the time to consider everybody's opinions, but at the same time has a clear sense of purpose and direction.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Houghton said that Mr. Brodsky got ''along well with everybody.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Mr. Houghton announced his plan to retire in early March, the board -- at 40 voting members, one of the largest of any American cultural institution -- formed a succession committee led by three longtime trustees, Henry B. Schacht, S. Parker Gilbert and Annette de la Renta. The committee spoke to a number of people -- the Met would say only that that group included Mr. Campbell -- and made its recommendation to the full board at its meeting on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview Mr. Brodsky said that his work on various board committees had given him a good view of how the museum was run and that he had enjoyed that learning process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The more you get involved with it, the better you know it, and the more you want to know about it,'' he said of the museum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Brodsky, who is unassuming in conversation, said he did not have a deep knowledge of art history or a favorite piece in the museum's collection, although he prefers modern art. His wife, Estrellita Brodsky, is an independent curator specializing in Latin American art who has endowed the post of Latin American curator at the Museum of Modern Art.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Brodsky is the managing director of the Brodsky Organization, a company he started with his father, Nathan Brodsky, in 1971. It currently owns and manages 6,200 apartments in 68 Manhattan buildings and has also developed a number of condominium and co-op buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a trustee of City Ballet, Mr. Brodsky played a significant role in rallying support among Lincoln Center's constituent organizations for the renovation of its campus, one of the biggest construction projects undertaken by a cultural institution in recent years. During the planning process, which was sometimes contentious, he said he learned that he enjoyed ''listening to people and hearing them out and being able to help people come to a consensus.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Brodsky is on the city's Cultural Affairs Advisory Commission, a group that works closely with the cultural affairs commissioner, Kate D. Levin, and appears to have a friendly, if not close, relationship with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg -- an asset in his new role, given that the city owns the Met's building and provides roughly 10 percent of its operating budget. Mr. Brodsky served on the city's 2012 Olympic bid committee, which also endorsed the mayor's proposal for a Jets stadium on the West Side, a plan that ultimately failed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking about why he became involved in the city's cultural institutions, Mr. Brodsky expressed a view strikingly similar to one often voiced by Mr. Bloomberg, describing them as an important component of the quality of life here, as well as a driver of tourism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking of Mr. Brodsky's influence on the New York cultural scene, Ms. Levin said, ''He has a larger footprint than people recognize, in part because he's such a modest, thoughtful guy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His appointment means that real estate developers will soon be chairmen of three of New York's major museums. Jerry I. Speyer, the chairman of MoMA, is also the chairman of Tishman Speyer; William L. Mack, at the Guggenheim Museum, is a founder and managing partner of <span class="companylink">Apollo Real Estate Advisors</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked if he saw any meaning in the trend, Mr. Brodsky said that real estate people were ''very concerned about the viability of the city,'' which cultural activity contributes to, ''so there's a logical reason for real estate people to be involved.''</p>

</div><div class="author">By DAVID LEONHARDT   </div><div>886 words</div><div>11 May 2011</div><div>NYT Blogs</div><div>NYTB</div><div>English</div><div>© 2011 The New York Times Company. All rights reserved   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking at the relative prices of buying and renting homes in Silicon Valley, Manhattan and a few other places is enough to make you wonder whether parts of the housing market are still due for a crash. To consider that question in more detail, I had a conversation with Mark Zandi, the chief economist at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics, which provided much of the data for my column:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. I'm struck at how much higher the rent ratio still is in many places, relative to its average from 1990 to 2010. It's about 18 in Washington (relative to a 1990-2010 average of 13), about 17 in Boston (relative to 15) and 15 across all metropolitan areas (relative to 11). Is there any reason to think the ratio should remain higher in the future than it was in the not-too-distant past? Or should we expect the ratio to continue falling in coming years, either through further house-price declines or through rent increases?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Zandi: I expect the house-price-to-rent ratio to continue falling at least through the remainder of this year and next. National house prices are set to decline by 5 percent this year, and apartment rents are on track to rise by about 5 percent. I do expect house prices to stabilize in 2012, but rents will continue to rise strongly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supporting the strong rent growth is declining apartment vacancy rates. Apartment demand is healthy given the better job market and accelerating household formation, particularly among younger households that generally rent, and the ongoing foreclosure crisis which is forcing families from home ownership into renting. Apartment construction is also especially low by historical standards. If this script roughly holds, the house-price-to-rent ratio will be back close to its long-run average in most areas of the country by 2013.Q. What about the Bay Area? The ratio is still an astronomical 35 in the East Bay, 31 in San Jose and 27 in San Francisco. Given what the national housing market has been through in the past several years, how are we supposed to believe that Northern California is not suffering from a major housing bubble right now?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Zandi: No, I don't think the Bay Area of California is currently suffering a housing bubble, despite the region's still historically high house-price-to-rent ratios. Supporting the region's higher price-to-rent ratio is mounting demand from overseas investors given the region's very significant global economic links. The rapid growth of Asian economies over the past 20 years, with strong links to the Bay Area's economy via international trade, immigration and investment, is especially important.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Californians have also been conditioned to buy homes during housing busts. The California housing market has been through many ups and downs, and if history is any guide, people who buy on the downs are rewarded in the long run. The Bay Area housing market is very supply-constrained, which means that house prices rise quickly once housing demand picks up even a little bit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having said this, I wouldn't be surprised in Bay Area house prices take longer to rev up than in times past given the current very debilitating housing crash, allowing rents to catch up, at least partially.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. When we were talking earlier, you mentioned that a straight comparison of rents and prices argues for renting in most places -- but that once you consider other factors, the issue becomes a closer call. Can you explain what you meant?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Zandi: A literal interpretation of the current house-price-to-rent ratio argues that it is still better for most households to rent rather than buy. This suggests that a prospective home buyer might want to wait until house prices fall even more before buying, but there are several important things to consider.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the coming house price declines will be for distressed properties -- foreclosures and short sales. In fact, prices for nondistressed homes are holding up well and may very well have hit bottom. And timing the precise bottom of house prices is an intrepid affair, and may not the best strategy if the homeowner plans to live in their home for more than a couple of years, as most homeowners do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is also important to keep in mind that mortgage rates are extraordinarily low, with the rate on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage currently well below 5 percent. Rates could go lower, but it is unlikely. As the economy continues to gain traction and the Federal Reserve ends its zero interest rate policy, mortgage rates will move higher. Indeed, in a well-functioning economy fixed mortgage rates will be closer to 6 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The still high price-to-rent ratio means that home buyers shouldn't be in a rush to buy a home, but owning is quickly looking more attractive, and it won't be long before owning is once again more financially attractive than renting.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SCARSDALE, N.Y.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RICHARD A. BAKER dashes through the Lord &amp; Taylor store here like Willy Wonka on a chocolate high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Look at these sweaters!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Check out this Ralph Lauren!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just wait till you see our store in Yonkers!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He squeaks to a stop at a table stacked with derriere enhancers. ''How is this doing, Charlie?'' he asks the store manager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then he surveys his domain: ''This building alone could be a $100 million property!''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Mr. Baker sounds like a rich kid playing with his new toys, well, that's because he is a rich kid playing with his new toys. Only the toys happen to be two of the oldest department store chains in North America: Lord &amp; Taylor, the grande dame that used to anchor the Ladies' Mile in Manhattan, and the <span class="companylink">Hudson's Bay Company</span> of Canada, which traces its roots back to the 17th-century fur trade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How Mr. Baker, 45, came to own these baubles is a story for our financial times. He's not exactly a self-made man. His father, Robert C. Baker, owns a giant shopping mall development company. But in 2006, just before the recession, the younger Mr. Baker took a flier and bought Lord &amp; Taylor, and later the <span class="companylink">Hudson's Bay Company</span>, putting down almost no money and borrowing more than $1 billion to finance the deals. Just about everyone in retailing wrote him off. Many whispered that he would get hammered, like several investment hotshots who set their sights on this business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a funny thing happened on the way to the comeuppance. It turns out that Mr. Baker wasn't so bad at running department stores. In 2010, sales at Lord &amp; Taylor's 46 stores rose 12.2 percent from the previous year, and are now higher than they were before the recession bit. And Hudson Bay's flagship Bay stores posted their first increase in same-store sales in a decade. Earnings at the combined companies totaled $450 million last year, before taxes, up from $330 million in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, Mr. Baker solved the company's debt problem, striking a complex deal to sell the rights to leases on an underperforming division of the <span class="companylink">Hudson's Bay Company</span> to Target for about $1.8 billion. There are discussions about an initial public offering of the combined companies as soon as this fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Richard shocked everybody,'' says Matthew E. Rubel, the chief executive of Collective Brands, which runs businesses like <span class="companylink">Payless ShoeSource</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REMEMBER that kid in high school who was always hawking T-shirts or trading baseball cards, rather than hitting the books? That kid was Richard Baker. He grew up in moneyed Greenwich, Conn., where he still lives. His high-school shtick was running his own high-end catering business. At 15, after taking courses at La Varenne, the Paris cooking school, he employed his private-school classmates as waiters and was hired for parties around Greenwich.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He was more interested in business than in being the captain of the basketball team,'' his father recalls. ''He was making money for the sake of making money.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His parents divorced when he was 12, and he spent most of his weekends with his father, visiting potential strip-mall sites. The Bakers grew up comfortably; they now live very comfortably. Richard Baker declined to show reporters his Greenwich house -- he does not want a ''Richard Baker's palatial estate'' article, he says, and one swimming pool is under renovation -- but the 10-acre property features loads of conceptual art that he and his wife, Lisa, commissioned, including a James Turrell pool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also has houses in Telluride, Colo., and on the North Fork of Long Island.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His father's lifestyle provides a glimpse of how Baker fils lives. In addition to houses in Greenwich and in Palm Beach, Fla., the elder Mr. Baker, 76, owns a floor-through apartment on Fifth Avenue and 63rd Street, looking out onto the Central Park Zoo. His view is of swimming sea lions, lolling polar bears and the exhibit housing a king penguin named Robert. (Richard and other family members, who had donated to the zoo, had him named in his father's honor.) A Degas and a Motherwell hang in his living room, and he owns Dublin, a thoroughbred that was in the Kentucky Derby in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He recruited his son into the family business after Richard graduated from the school of hotel management at Cornell. Richard had wanted to build a chain of chicken-wing restaurants, but his father talked him out of it during a walk along the beach near his summer rental in Quogue on Long Island.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I said, 'You know, in a chicken-wing restaurant, you've got to be up early in the morning, you've got to work late at night,' '' Robert Baker recalls. '' 'Maybe you should see if the real estate business is for you.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard agreed -- and soon, working for his father, came up with the idea of courting <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span> to lease space at their malls; until then, the chain had not opened stores on the East Coast. His father remembers flying to the retailer's famously spare headquarters in Bentonville, Ark. ''We were in this room for three hours, sitting, without anyone offering coffee or water,'' he recalls. Finally, some lower-level executives came in, he adds, but little was accomplished.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard stayed with it, and <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span> eventually did its first East Coast deal with the Bakers' company, the <span class="companylink">National Realty &amp; Development Corporation</span>, opening a store in Canandaigua, N.Y. Though Kmart would offer a dollar a foot more for a space, Robert Baker says, his son preferred <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span>, believing that it had better growth prospects. Today, <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span> has 35 stores in Baker-developed malls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BUT by 2005, after working for his father for nearly two decades, Richard Baker grew restless. As a friend puts it, ''He didn't want to spend the rest of his life renewing <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span> leases.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real money, by then, was in another kind of deal. Banks were heavy with cash and were lending billions to Wall Street investors to acquire giant companies. It was, as the dealmaker Henry Kravis would later call it, ''the golden age of private equity.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In real estate private equity circles, retail companies became the hot investment, as their property holdings often made them worth more than their balance sheets suggested.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Baker became intrigued by a transaction known on jargon-happy Wall Street as an ''opco propco'' deal. In this structure, a retailer that owned its stores would be split into a retail operating company (opco) and a property company (propco). This way, a buyer of a chain could borrow more money to finance the acquisition by using the real estate as security, instead of just using the company's cash flow for collateral.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks were eager to finance property deals, thanks to a white-hot market in commercial mortgage-backed securities -- pools of bank loans backed by real estate from hotels, offices and stores that are then sold to investors and removed from bank balance sheets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It may have been a bubble -- ''you could have taken over a whole country using C.M.B.S. in those days,'' says a senior real estate executive who has done business with Mr. Baker -- but it was one that Mr. Baker wanted to ride.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over bagels and Nova at the Rye Ridge Deli in Stamford, Conn., Mr. Baker pitched Lee S. Neibart, a friend of his father's and a prominent New York real estate investor: Why not set up a private equity shop to do these deals?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With Richard Baker as chief executive, the Bakers, Mr. Neibart and Mr. Neibart's business partner Bill Mack formed <span class="companylink">NRDC Equity Partners</span>, a private equity firm aimed at retailers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their first deal was a dud. After losing out to a consortium of real estate and private equity investors on Toys ''R'' Us in 2005, Mr. Baker and his partners invested $25 million alongside <span class="companylink">Apollo Global Management</span>, the private equity firm, in its $5.1 billion purchase of <span class="companylink">Linens 'n Things</span>. They lost their entire investment when the company, a housewares retailer, collapsed three years later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard Baker says the fiasco taught him a lesson. ''Where I failed was that if I'm going to invest in a transaction, I need to control it,'' he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2006, Mr. Baker suspected that <span class="companylink">Federated Department Stores</span>, which had just acquired May Department Stores, would put May's tired Lord &amp; Taylor chain on the block. Before Federated even asked for bids, Mr. Baker kicked the tires and lined up financing, letting him close the deal before other parties had completed their bids.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To pay for Lord &amp; Taylor, which cost $1.2 billion, Mr. Baker and his partners invested just $25 million of their own money and borrowed the rest against the chain's real estate, including the Manhattan flagship on Fifth Avenue at 38th Street. The deal was financed with more than $1 billion in C.M.B.S. loans from -- ah, 2006 -- <span class="companylink">Bear Stearns</span> and <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We paid a full price for it, but the real estate was sufficient to bail us out as a backstop,'' Mr. Neibart says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Hudson's Bay Company</span>, one of the oldest companies in North America, would be the next target. Its crown jewel was the Bay chain, with about 90 locations. ''Richard knew that there were at least 10 department stores in the United States that filled the market that the Bay could fill alone in Canada,'' says Bonnie Brooks, who Mr. Baker appointed as C.E.O. of the Bay division in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canada has Sears at the bottom of the department store market and <span class="companylink">Holt Renfrew</span> at the top, Ms. Brooks says. ''The only store between Sears and Holt is really the Bay,'' she says. ''And in America, in that same zone, you have everyone from Saks to Lord &amp; Taylor to <span class="companylink">Macy's</span>, Dillard's, Bloomingdale's.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there was the <span class="companylink">Hudson's Bay Company</span> real estate. The chain owns many of its stores, including the Bay flagships in Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Baker also found the company an alluring target because he thought United States chains would want to expand northward. In Canada, new builders go through a long government approval process; the simplest way to enter the market is through acquisitions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He picked up the phone and cold-called Jerry Zucker, a billionaire businessman in South Carolina who had acquired Hudson's Bay in late 2006. Mr. Baker offered to buy 20 percent of it. The deal was made in early 2007, for $100 million, with just $10 million cash down. His father was not thrilled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He overpaid for the 20 percent that we bought, and we did not have sufficient protection,'' Robert Baker says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About a year later, Richard Baker received a call from Mr. Zucker, who told him he had brain cancer and would be dead within three months. Would Mr. Baker like to buy the rest of the company? It would be their last conversation. Mr. Zucker died three weeks later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bakers' group negotiated the deal with Mr. Zucker's estate, offering $1.3 billion for the <span class="companylink">Hudson's Bay Company</span> -- but it didn't have to open its own wallets. Of that amount, about $1 billion was debt. The remaining $300 million was covered by a sovereign wealth fund in Abu Dhabi -- a longtime investor with Mr. Mack and Mr. Neibart -- that invested $500 million cash. (The leftovers went to pay down some debt.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Baker formed a holding company, the Hudson's Bay Trading Company, that owned Lord &amp; Taylor, the Bay stores and Canadian units like Zellers department stores. The Middle East investors owned just under half of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He hired new executives and began to trumpet turnaround plans. It was July 2008, three months before the collapse of the financial markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BRENDAN HOFFMAN has the broad shoulders and the wide, friendly face of a high school football player. He is 42 but looks no older than his late 20s. In 2008, he was heading <span class="companylink">Neiman Marcus</span>'s catalog and online sales division when Richard Baker called. How would he like to bring his luxury contacts to Lord &amp; Taylor?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Baker thought the stores looked dull, and wanted to continue an upscale move away from middle-America brands like Nautica and Gold Toe socks and toward hot designers like Theory and Kate Spade. Mr. Hoffman was brought in as C.E.O. to do just that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the day after Labor Day in 2008, when Mr. Hoffman accepted Mr. Baker's offer, the Dow Jones industrials closed at 11,517. By the end of his first week on the job in October, it had sunk as low as 7,774. Almost immediately, sales at mid- to upper-end retailers went into a tailspin. At Lord &amp; Taylor, where rumors were already rampant about its solvency, it was worse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're a highly leveraged company that now is dropping 15 percent on sales,'' Mr. Hoffman recalls about that time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The holding company seemed to have contracts with just about every troubled business. In addition to its loans financed by Lehman and <span class="companylink">Bear Stearns</span> -- which had been sold off by then, making it beholden to smaller investors -- its merchandise was marooned on container ships because of questions about the validity of its insurance policies with the <span class="companylink">American International Group</span>. A trucking company had stopped delivering goods because its line of credit with <span class="companylink">Wachovia</span> was uncertain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Vendors were asking for 10 percent payment up front, prepayment, 15-day payment cycles,'' Mr. Hoffman says. ''Goods were coming in two weeks later than competitors', and we didn't have enough people in finance to answer the phones.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the luxury market tanked, the executives abandoned the upscale move at Lord &amp; Taylor and focused instead on more clothing with mass appeal. They sliced $400 million from the holding company's budget, and Mr. Baker jettisoned several of his grand plans. An in-house fashion-designer incubator at Lord &amp; Taylor was closed, and he liquidated Fortunoff, which NRDC had acquired out of bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales at Lord &amp; Taylor fell 10 percent in the first half of 2009 versus the year-earlier period and were off 2 percent for the year as a whole -- still much better than many rivals' results. And the figures have continued to improve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's attributable, Mr. Baker says, to investment in stores. Profits went into refurbishing them, adding artificial and natural light and switching out brands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think because of his real estate background, the floor space is almost a sacred area,'' Mr. Hoffman says. ''It's like tenants paying rent: 'We've got to find what will maximize the return for it.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though industry consultants say the stores look good, they question the strategy of carrying brands that can be found anywhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was in there the other day and I thought it was fabulous,'' says Emanuel Weintraub, founder of a firm that consults with retailers and vendors. ''The bottom line is, will they be able to get the exclusive brands, or the high-profile brands, that their competitors have?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bay stores have taken a more upscale approach. They have dropped 900 mostly lackluster brands and has brought in new ones like Coach. The Bay, too, will revamp almost all its stores by year-end. Its sales at stores open at least a year, a key measure of retail health, rose 4 percent in 2010, the first increase in more than a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The holding company's debt problem was largely solved by a transaction struck in January. Target agreed to pay about $1.8 billion for the rights to leases on up to 220 Zellers department stores, a discount chain unit of Hudson's Bay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, the Hudson's Bay Trading Company business now has about $7 billion in retail sales and more than 50 million square feet of real estate worth billions of dollars. For their slice, Mr. Baker and his partners laid out a total of about $25 million. Today, by conservative estimates, that stake is worth nearly $1 billion on paper. For those keeping score, that's about 40 times their cash investment, though they have yet to withdraw any profit from the business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. BAKER prefers to do most of his business from the back of his Cadillac Escalade. His driver, Kevin R. Maher, leaves it running while idle, in case Mr. Baker wants to save a few seconds getting somewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike old-money sorts who try to play down their wealth, Mr. Baker seems to revel in his. He has Mr. Maher take a spin through the Brunswick School in Greenwich, a private school for which he helped build a new campus. (He attended it, as do his sons.) He alludes to his family's Gulfstream jet and talks about his art collection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When not working on deals, he often spends his days walking through stores -- and you get the sense that their managers are accustomed to seeing his caller ID come up on their phones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is so busy at his stores that another big acquisition seems unlikely for now. But you never know. As his father says: ''I'm comfortable that he's not going to turn around and try to buy General Motors or something -- other than if he does it with a little bit of our money and a whole lot of someone else's.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CONNECTICUT'S housing market went into hibernation during the first quarter of 2011 as sales took a dive and prices continued to deteriorate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blame the harsh weather, says Candace Adams, the president of Prudential Connecticut Realty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's always the unpredictable,'' Ms. Adams said, ''and for us, what I will call the Black Swan of 2011 was the weather. We had a snowstorm a week and sometimes two or three a week. That did have an impact on sales for the first quarter of the year.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet while the winter may be part of the reason for the slowdown in an already sluggish market, the same long-term structural problems that are affecting the rest of the country continue to be a drag on Connecticut home sales. The state's foreclosure numbers have improved -- first-quarter filings were down 65 percent, according to RealtyTrac -- but those figures may overstate the degree, Ms. Adams said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We don't know if that's because a lot of banks put a moratorium on foreclosures, and how much of a shadow inventory is out there,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All in all, housing market experts say, prospects are dim for a robust rebound this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Many people have poor credit histories at this point and can't qualify for a loan, or are feeling too indebted and don't want to take on more debt,'' said John Clapp, the director of the Center for Real Estate and Urban Economic Studies at the University of Connecticut. ''And the other thing is low expectations. In general, I expect us to bounce around on the bottom.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The center tracks market performance at the low, middle and high ends of Connecticut's single-family-home market. In the first three months of the year both prices and sales declined compared with 2010, when the market appeared to have stabilized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price of an average mid-tier house -- one built around 1962 with about 1,500 square feet of space and two baths -- has retreated to the level of year-end 2002, Mr. Clapp said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prudential's quarterly report showed a 13 percent drop in home sales statewide compared with last year. In New Haven County the decline was significantly larger, at 20 percent. Ms. Adams ascribed the difference to the expiration last year of the federal home-buyer tax credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of a single-family home in Connecticut declined an average of 2 percent, to $240,000. Condominiums showed a 7 percent reduction, to $163,500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, Ms. Adams noted that over all, ''we are seeing inventory levels fairly constant, and absorption rates are still under a year in most places, so the market appears to be healthy in terms of the new normal.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fairfield County continues to log the highest median price, though it is down about 1 percent, to $420,000. Windham County, after a nearly 12 percent decline, is at the lowest median, $150,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The general lack of enthusiasm is mirrored in construction activity. The roughly 500 building permits issued in Connecticut during the first quarter represent 20 percent fewer than for the same period last year, according to the latest Connecticut Economic Digest, published by the state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But serious buyers are out there, especially those who have been waiting out the market slump by renting, said Mark Markelz, an agent with William Raveis in Fairfield.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You have buyers that are shoppers who are looking for the 'best deal' out there,'' Mr. Markelz said, ''but others are focused on a particular neighborhood. There is a pent-up-demand market, and they've been looking for a while.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers with money to spend are bolstering the luxury end of the market, which alone is showing strong improvement. Sales above $2 million were up nearly 20 percent statewide during the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus, in a town like New Canaan, where the median is now about $1.7 million, overall sales and price numbers managed to buck the downward trend during the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Greenwich, sales in the $5 million to $7 million range jumped 150 percent, from four sales in the first quarter of 2010 to 10 this year, according to a report prepared by Shore and Country Properties. Sales in the $2 million to $3 million range were up 36 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet properties in Greenwich are nevertheless feeling the impact of stringent lender requirements on down payments and reserves, according to Russell Pruner, a partner in Shore and Country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It could be a minimum of 20 percent or upward of 40 percent, the higher you go in value,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To Mr. Pruner's mind, the most that even Greenwich can hope for this year is to halt the downward trend and hold appreciation levels flat. Greenwich home sales may beat last year's and break 600, but that will still be well behind the town's 20-year average of more than 700 sales a year, he said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By CHARLES V. BAGLI   </div><div>1017 words</div><div>2 May 2011</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>23</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many landlords would like to turn back the clock to 2008, when it was easier to deregulate thousands of vacant apartments and increase rents by hundreds of dollars or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A bill pending in the State Senate would let them do just that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bill would offer what supporters call a ''legislative solution'' to a 2009 ruling by the New York Court of Appeals that said the owners of the Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village complexes in Manhattan had improperly deregulated thousands of apartments while taking special tax benefits from the city. The ruling also affected an estimated 40,000 other apartments in similar circumstances, mostly in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But 18 months after the ruling, no one is quite sure what the legal rents of those apartments should be or how much in rebates the tenants are entitled to. The proposed legislation would essentially allow landlords to buy their way out of the problem by paying back the tax breaks, enabling them to keep the apartments renting at free-market rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tenant advocates are outraged, but real estate executives say the bill would put an end to what could be years of litigation over the issue and uncertainty racking the industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We need a legislative solution,'' said Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York. ''It's a bill that would generate substantial money for the city, anywhere from $100 million to $300 million. It would allow people to pay back the tax benefits, and free them from back-rent claims and the requirement to go back to rent regulation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But tenant advocates and their lawyers say the bill would offer help to landlords who broke the law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Why you would allow a landlord to benefit from circumventing the rent regulation laws is beyond me,'' said Daniel R. Garodnick, a city councilman who rents a market-rate apartment at Peter Cooper Village that has been re-regulated as a result of the Court of Appeals ruling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The court said the complexes' owners had improperly turned rent-stabilized apartments into free-market apartments while also participating in the city's J-51 program, which gives tax breaks to landlords who rehabilitate their properties. The ruling affected about 4,400 of the 11,226 apartments at Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is little question that the bill, which was sponsored by Senator Catharine Young, a Republican from Olean in western New York, would benefit landlords. The bill would allow the owners of Stuyvesant Town to repay more than $24 million in tax breaks at 9 percent interest, a total of at least $26.16 million. The landlords would not have to roll back rents or repay what tenant advocates estimate is $200 million in rent overcharges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the bill could provide a windfall for the city, opponents say it would cost tenants far more in additional rent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The improper deregulation began under the complexes' original owners, the <span class="companylink">Metropolitan Life Insurance Company</span>, and continued after Tishman Speyer, the real estate firm, and a partner bought them for $5.4 billion in 2006. But the rent roll could not support Tishman Speyer's debt. The new owners defaulted and the complex is now controlled by CW Capital, a company representing a group of lenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bill is one of several real-estate matters under consideration in Albany, and it is unclear which of them will ultimately pass both houses. The state's rent regulations are set to expire June 15, and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and the Democratic-led Assembly want to extend and expand the regulations, giving tenants more protection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Rent Stabilization Association, which represents landlords, is focused on stopping any expansion of the rent laws. In a March presentation to his members that can now be seen on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>, Joseph Strasburg, president of the association, said that the organization had ''emptied our piggy bank'' on behalf of the State Senate majority leader, Dean G. Skelos, and other Republicans willing to hold the line on rent regulation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Real Estate Board, which represents many developers, is interested in another issue: the extension of tax breaks for new residential buildings, a proposal Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has opposed because, officials say, the benefits it provides are so generous that the city might as well build affordable units itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both Mr. Strasburg and Mr. Spinola acknowledge that the legislation related to the Stuyvesant Town court decision is less of a priority for them than those other issues. But it is important for Adam R. Rose, a president of Rose Associates, which manages Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village for CW Capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the tenants affected by the ruling, and the bill in Albany, were ''high-earning tenants'' who signed market-rent leases, ''never dreaming that the apartments would be rent regulated.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It makes no sense that these well-heeled tenants should gain a windfall from this court decision,'' he said. ''The only way this will end with some sort of certainty is with a legislative solution.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Alexander H. Schmidt, the lawyer for the nine plaintiffs in the Stuyvesant Town case, said that before the court ruling, landlords had tried to ''do an end run around legislation that was clearly intended to prohibit deregulation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the consequences were clear for people like Thomas I. Shamy and his wife, who lived in a one-bedroom, free-market apartment at Stuyvesant Town for three years when the new owner notified him in 2006 that his monthly rent would jump 28 percent to $2,750. Unable to afford the increase, the Shamys moved to a smaller apartment elsewhere. Under the court ruling, the apartment should have been rent-stabilized, limiting rent increases to a few percentage points a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Giving up my home was not something I wanted to do,'' Mr. Shamy said in a deposition in the case. ''At the time, my wife was four months pregnant with our first child, and we anticipated remaining in the child-friendly Stuyvesant Town community.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ANY broker would be happy to list Ellen Ball's co-op apartment in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a prestigious block in the West Village in a prewar doorman building, the four-bedroom three-bath apartment has been completely renovated and is large enough for a young family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there is a hitch. It is not for sale. At least not officially.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Ball, who is married and has three children, is interested in selling her apartment, but she is not interested in putting it on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She is one of a small group of owners, who, often working closely with brokers they know from past deals, try to avoid the hassle of showing their homes by letting it be known that for the right price, they would be ready to move on. For Ms. Ball, the right price is anywhere from $3.5 million to $4 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among brokers, such a transaction -- in which a seller informally engages a broker but doesn't sign a contract -- is referred to as a ''pocket deal.'' If the broker finds a buyer, he or she will be paid a commission, but there will be no online listings, open houses or advertising of the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What the seller wants from the arrangement is a buyer who can meet the asking price, ideally in cash, and be ready to act quickly. Brokers say these deals -- happening all across Manhattan, on multimillion-dollar Park Avenue co-ops as well as chic TriBeCa lofts -- are interesting more sellers these days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are many reasons a seller might take the pocket-deal route. Some are afraid that if they list the apartment and it does not sell for weeks or even months, it will be considered tarnished. Others fear that with buyers expecting bargains, they will be besieged with low-ball offers. Some do not want to keep their homes primped and primed for constant showings. Still others know that potential buyers often fail to get financing at the last minute, thus wasting months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, of course, there are some who are holding out for the price they were fantasizing about before the market fell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some brokers say pocket sales are increasing because listings for desirable inventory are low. Inventory shrank after a small boomlet last spring, when many owners accepted the reality of the market, priced their apartments accordingly and saw them sell. This spring, it seems, many of those listing their apartments believe the market has recovered more fully than it actually has, and are overpricing their properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is not that there is a lack of inventory, period,'' said Jeremy V. Stein, a broker at Sotheby's International, who, along with his wife, Robin Stein, is working with Ms. Ball to find potential buyers. ''It is that there is a lack of inventory priced right.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet for all the explanations that sellers may offer to justify keeping their homes off the market, pocket deals are frowned upon by many in the industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I do not think this is a really good way for most people to sell their apartment,'' said Pamela Liebman, the president of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>. Often, she said, a person who declares an interest in selling an apartment without listing it is not serious. In many cases, brokers find that these deals are not worth the trouble. Instead of using the tried-and-true tools for moving Manhattan properties, like advertising them and holding open houses, brokers are forced to play matchmaker -- and in this city, where real estate passions run hot, it isn't easy being Cupid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think ultimately the sellers hurt themselves,'' Ms. Liebman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The term ''pocket deal'' usually implies that a broker is intimately involved in working with the seller, despite the lack of an official listing. But sometimes property owners just put the word out on the wind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, the owners of a mansion at 16 East 69th Street, once owned by a member of the Vanderbilt family, never signed an exclusive deal with a broker. But they let it be known that if a broker had a client who might be interested in the house, he or she could show the property. In the end, although various brokers took clients through, no broker was given a commission on the $47 million sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Decades ago, when co-brokering was not a common practice, not listing a property was a way of controlling the buyer pool, and often a means of racial or ethnic discrimination. Now, even those who dislike pocket deals say they find no evidence of their being used to discriminate. The Real Estate Board of New York has a set of rules that member brokers must follow when they sign a contract to sell an apartment, established in part to ensure fairness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Doyle, the board's senior vice president for government affairs, said that by far the most common course was for an owner to sign an exclusive written agreement with a broker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If they have signed a deal giving the broker an exclusive right to sell,'' Mr. Doyle said, ''then the seller has to pay the broker even if they brought in the buyer.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After signing such an agreement, if the broker is a member of the real estate board, he or she must post the property to the association's listing service so that it can be universally co-brokered, Mr. Doyle said. There is a financial penalty for board members who fail to post their listings, and repeated offenses can lead to dismissal from the association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While pocket deals account for only a fraction of the deals done in the city, they can be galling to brokers who ply the conventional sales route.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, if a broker and a client are searching for a specific kind of apartment, and then, on a real estate Web site, the client learns about the sale of a desirable place that he was never shown, he may conclude that his broker was asleep on the job. But the apartment that got away may have been a pocket deal, posted as a one-day sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers, for their part, watch pocket deals like hawks. In the case of the Vanderbilt mansion, for one, brokers are waiting to see the name on the contract in the event it is someone they have taken to the property. If so, the sellers can expect a call.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But much as many brokers don't like pocket deals, few would turn down the chance to take part in one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nowadays there is wide agreement that available inventory, especially at the higher end, is not in the choicest neighborhoods or buildings. Corcoran has 9,000 listings on its Web site, compared with 12,000 at this time last year. Agents have been known to blanket entire buildings with solicitations to sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And many brokers say that sellers are still being unrealistic about pricing their properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Gomes, an executive vice president of Prudential Douglas Elliman, said that he had been swamped by buyers looking for apartments in ''highly desired neighborhoods and highly desirable buildings.'' He said he had little to show them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So he has to try other means of finding what he needs. ''Everything is for sale,'' he said with a smile. ''Even when a property is not really for sale, it can be for sale.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He cited a recent transaction, involving a Brazilian buyer, at the Caledonia at 450 West 17th Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buyer wanted an apartment in the building, but the only one available was too small. So Mr. Gomes slipped notes under the doors of neighboring apartments to see if anyone might be interested in selling. It turned out someone was, and the buyer snapped up both apartments, with the intention of combining them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such deals can be more expensive than they would be on the open market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When you buy an apartment that is not listed,'' Mr. Gomes said, ''there is often a premium attached.'' He noted that the Brazilian buyer probably paid around $100,000 more for the neighboring apartment than she would have had it been on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he also cited a certain pride that came with getting something no one else can.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They boast about it,'' he said. '' 'It wasn't even on the market and I got it.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Steins said they would like nothing more than to list the Ball apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have been trying to get them to list for two years,'' Mr. Stein said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stein always advises his clients that they are better off on the open market. But, he said, thanks to the lack of inventory, his e-mail inbox has been flooded in recent months with requests from other brokers looking to find places outside the system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Often, the requests are highly specific. After shielding the identity of a broker who approached him, Mr. Stein shared the contents of one such e-mail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have a client seeking a prewar condo or co-op in Greenwich Village or West Village,'' the message read. ''It must be on a high floor with good sunlight. The apartment should be at least three bedrooms and no less than 1,800 sq. ft. Price point is between $5 million and $12 million. They are all-cash buyers. Alternatively, a town house in the same neighborhoods may work as well. If you have or know of something not on the market, I would be delighted to learn about it. Please contact me to discuss. Thank you.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe one of these private solicitations will lead to the Ball apartment. Ms. Ball, meanwhile, has another worry. Not only does she have to sell her place, she also has to find an apartment in the same general area with more space within her family's budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are not trying to time the market,'' she said. ''You have to do what is right for your life.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And with three small children, she said, staging open houses and keeping the apartment ready to show at all times is too difficult.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Ball and her family will spend most of their time at their house in the Hamptons this summer. If they have not found a buyer willing to match their price by then, she said, it might be time to list the place for sale.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PRICES for both homes and commercial real estate are falling again. Meaningful improvement may have to wait until there are many fewer distressed properties for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indexes of the two markets showed this week that the latest declines had almost wiped out the mild gains the two markets had shown after prices appeared to have hit bottom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller index of home prices ended February 3.3 percent below where it was a year earlier, and just 0.5 percent above the low reached in May 2009. The <span class="companylink">Moody's</span>/REAL Commercial Property Price Index was reported to be down 4.9 percent over the last 12 months, but still 0.8 percent above its low, reached last August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In both cases, sales volumes are far below what they were when the markets were booming, and a large proportion of the properties that are being sold were in trouble before the sale. The National Association of Realtors estimates that about 40 percent of existing homes that changed hands in March were either in foreclosure or were so-called short sales in which the house was sold for less than was owed on the existing mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commercial property index, which is based on data collected by <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>, shows that 29 percent of transactions in February involved distressed properties -- including those already in foreclosure or default, as well as those whose owners had filed for bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Only when the share of distressed sales meaningfully drops off will we be able to enter the recovery phase,'' said Tad Philipp, <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> director of commercial real estate research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As can be seen from the accompanying charts, home prices nationally peaked in 2006 but did not begin to plunge until 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first, that was widely viewed as a result of problems in the subprime mortgage market. Commercial real estate prices rose until early 2008, but then declined rapidly. The latest values for the indexes show national home prices down 31 percent from peak levels, while the commercial real estate index shows a fall of 45 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The charts show the trend of prices since December 2000. Home prices are about 27 percent higher than they were then, but commercial real estate is up just 6 percent. Meanwhile, in a tortoise-versus-hare tale, home rental rates are higher than they ever were even though they failed to boom when real estate prices soared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both indexes are based on repeat sales of the same property, and the relative lack of commercial property transactions -- the index counted only 107 in February for more than $2.5 million each -- means that the figures are far from exact. But they do show trends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to data from <span class="companylink">Moody's</span>, hotels and apartments are in the most distress, with about 16 percent of loans in each category classified as delinquent. About 10 percent of loans on industrial property are in trouble, while the figures for offices and retail properties are lower, at around 7 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, the proportion of commercial loans in distress climbed from under 1 percent at the end of 2008 to over 9 percent now. But it has been stable in recent months, providing some hope that the market is no longer deteriorating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a regional basis, the same markets tend to have problems in both commercial and residential real estate. The three states with the highest proportion of commercial loans in distress, according to <span class="companylink">Moody's</span>, are Nevada, Arizona and Michigan. In Nevada, more than 30 percent of loans are classified as being in trouble, nearly double Arizona's 16 percent figure.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For more than six years Akridge, a developer in Washington, had its eye on a 10-story office building in Bethesda, Md., which had been vacant since the National Institutes of Health moved out in 2002.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the federal government did not put the building on the market until November 2009. By then, of course, the real estate market had slumped. Akridge and its partner, Rockwood Capital, a real estate investment fund in White Plains, finally bought the building last October, paying $12.5 million, less than the $14 million asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a report last October Republicans in Congress pounced on the long delay in selling the Bethesda building -- and the discounted price -- as an example of how the federal government has been mismanaging its real estate holdings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government owns or manages more than 900,000 buildings or other structures across the country -- office buildings, courthouses, warehouses and other property types -- making it the nation's largest landlord. But like the former N.I.H. building, about 14,000 are no longer needed and are costly to maintain. An additional 55,000 are regarded as underutilized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report was also harshly critical of government spending to operate surplus and underused buildings, including $6.5 million for the Old Post Office Building at 12th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington. The administration's own figures estimate the annual operating expenses for those buildings at more than $1.8 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last June President Obama ordered executive agencies to accelerate efforts to dispose of unneeded buildings, and set a goal of saving $3 billion by the end of 2012. Yet various obstacles make it difficult for the government to unload buildings it no longer wants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For one thing they must first be offered to other federal, state and local agencies. Officials also have to ascertain if the building has a community use -- say, for a homeless shelter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At times an agency may want to sell an obsolete building but cannot afford the moving costs, Jeffrey D. Zients, a deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget, said in a telephone interview. Then, too, political considerations may come into play. ''Politicians love to come hold a ribbon-cutting for a new building,'' Mr. Zients said. ''Getting rid of a building is less rewarding.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Obama administration has determined that if the barriers to selling were removed, he said, the savings could be much higher -- $15 billion over five years. The sum includes the dollars not spent on maintenance and energy costs as well as sale proceeds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To speed up the disposal process the administration wants to create an independent commission modeled after the Base Realignment and Closure Commission, or BRAC, a process begun in 1988 to review Defense Department recommendations for closing military bases. The proposed commission, the Civilian Property Realignment Board, would be able to cut through much of the existing red tape, establish new procedures and come up with recommendations for selling property in bulk, Mr. Zients said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commission would also recommend ways the government could use its space more efficiently by, for example, consolidating space or getting agencies to move into one building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, the legislation is expected to provide incentives for federal agencies by allowing them to share in the proceeds from any sales. To reduce political influence, the commission's recommendations would be submitted to Congress as a package and not subject to amendment -- similar to the way the base closure recommendations were handled. Daniel Werfel, the controller for the Office of Management and Budget, said the commission would include people with experience in commercial real estate, government operations and community development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commission concept has bipartisan support, said Jeff Denham, Republican of California and the chairman of the House subcommittee on public buildings. ''The goal in the short term is to sell as many buildings as possible to generate some immediate cash flow to help with the debt crisis,'' said Mr. Denham, who backed a similar proposal when he was a state legislator. The longer-term goal is to improve the way the federal government handles its real estate needs, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some real estate experts wondered if a board was necessary. ''Whenever government is faced with a problem, the first thing they do is appoint a commission,'' said Nicholas R. Smith, an executive vice president at <span class="companylink">First Potomac Realty Trust</span>, a publicly traded company that leases more than 700,000 square feet to the government. Mr. Smith said the process for selling federal property should simply be made less complex.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeffrey D. DeBoer, the chief executive of the Real Estate Roundtable, a Washington trade group that represents industry leaders, described the proposed board as a ''positive idea.'' But he urged the government to restrict its sales efforts for now to stronger markets with relatively low office vacancy rates, like Manhattan, the Back Bay area of Boston, Washington, San Francisco and the West Side of Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our concerns are about the unnecessary dumping of assets in some markets that are oversupplied because of economic conditions,'' Mr. DeBoer said. ''We want to make sure we don't make weak markets weaker.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In their report last October criticizing the sale of the Bethesda office building, Republican members of the House Transportation Committee excoriated other government real estate practices. Titled ''Sitting on Our Assets,'' it said, for example, that the government spent about $12 million a year to operate the Old Post Office, which is near the White House, and collected only about $5.5 million in annual rent from the federal agencies and retailers that occupy about half the space. In 2008 Congress authorized the General Services Administration to solicit bids for redeveloping the building, but the requests for proposals went out only in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Douglas M. Firstenberg, a principal of StonebridgeCarras, leading developer of government-leased buildings, said that despite its prime location the Old Post Office is a tough sell. Development options would be limited because the building is historic and has existing tenants. ''If you could start with a clean slate,'' Mr. Firstenberg said, ''the line of people who would want to be involved would be endless.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Darian A. LeBlanc, a senior managing director at Cassidy Turley, a Washington real estate company, said the National Institutes of Health building in Bethesda sold for a low price because of its poor condition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buyer, Akridge, plans to spend $33 million to upgrade the building to attract private tenants, said P. Brian Connolly, a senior vice president. Mr. Connolly said it would not have been appropriate for the government to invest that much. ''Government entities are not in the risk-taking business,'' he said. ''We believe this is a wonderfully safe investment, but there's always a risk.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some lawmakers have also criticized the federal government for renting when it could be owning. According to government figures, leasing costs increased to $8.1 billion in the 2009 fiscal year from $6.7 billion in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a recent hearing Mr. Denham, the California congressman, said the Transportation Department was spending more than $1 billion to lease its headquarters at New Jersey Avenue and M Street Southeast. ''Yet the government could have purchased several buildings for this amount,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Werfel of the Office of Management and Budget said he could not comment specifically on that lease. ''But as a general rule,'' he said, ''if we know we're going to have a long-term presence in a building -- 15 to 30 years -- we should be owning, not leasing space.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not surprisingly brokers who negotiate government leases say there are often substantial advantages to renting space. ''Once you've owned a building for 30 years -- then what?'' said Joseph B. Brennan, a managing director at <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>. ''When you lease the space, you get the prime value from the building, and then you're able to move on.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: April 28, 2011, Thursday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article in the Square Feet pages on Wednesday about the federal government's difficulty in divesting some of its real estate holdings misspelled the name of a deputy director in the Office of Management and Budget. He is Jeffrey D. Zients, not Jeffrey D. Zeints.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there was any lingering doubt, the latest data confirm that housing is still in a deep and broad recession. In the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller home price report for 20 large cities, house prices in February fell to a level last seen in April 2009 -- their lowest point in the bust. In a Census Bureau report, new home sales in March remained near their lowest levels since records were first kept in 1963.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would be comforting to believe that housing-market distress represents a normal, if painful, correction after a period of excess. But all housing trends -- in prices, sales, construction and foreclosures -- indicate a market that is likely to decline even more, and far more than is needed to erase the artificial gains of the bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High postbubble unemployment coupled with falling home equity will lead to more defaults and foreclosures. The resulting downward pull on prices will probably not be offset by adequate demand because potential buyers will be afraid they are still buying high in a declining market. Rather than a virtuous self-correcting cycle, the housing market is caught in a negative self-reinforcing one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The best response would be for government to adopt policies to attack joblessness and foreclosures, including public investment in infrastructure and high-technology manufacturing and a renewed emphasis on negotiating new loan terms for homeowners whose homes have declined in value. Unfortunately, Washington is moving in the opposite direction on the mistaken belief that cutting budget deficits and leaving wounded markets to their own devices will somehow spur the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a while it looked as if struggling homeowners might get some relief soon: Fines on banks responsible for foreclosure abuses could be used to modify troubled mortgages. But that is looking less likely, as state and federal officials differ over whether the banks can afford to pay up. They can.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without a healthy housing market, there cannot be a healthy economic recovery. The family home is still most Americans' biggest asset, so declining values destroy wealth and curtail spending. Homes are also the source of local-government property tax revenues and the collateral for many small business loans. They hold families and neighborhoods and communities together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The numbers are getting worse, and that is bad for everyone. The question is how much worse they will need to get before regulators, lawmakers and the Obama administration make an all-out effort to fix the problem.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the recession the developer Brookfield Office Properties shelved plans to build several office towers on a 5.4-million-square-foot property that runs from Ninth Avenue to Dyer Avenue, between West 31st and West 33rd Streets. But Brookfield did not ignore the project in the downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The developer spent the last several years studying the engineering of a deck over the rail yards on the site, and says it has found a way to build it cheaper and quicker. It will start construction later this year, with plans to deliver a two-million-square-foot office tower designed by <span class="companylink">Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill</span> on the northeast corner of the parcel by 2015. There are plans to eventually construct as many as three towers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We will start building the deck on spec but are confident that by the time we get around to building the tower, we will have found an anchor tenant,'' said Ric Clark, the president and chief executive. While he declined to give asking rents for the tower, Brookfield has begun preliminary conversations with tenants and expects to be competitively priced with the Hudson Yards buildings the Related Companies is planning a few blocks west.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As rents rebound and vacancies fall in the New York office market, some developers like Mr. Clark who shelved projects in the recession are resurrecting their plans. Several buildings are in the pipeline, and nearly 9.5 million square feet could become available over the next few years -- in addition to several million more square feet at the World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan and the Hudson Yards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A number of factors are driving the trend. Commercial rents are rising in certain submarkets and have held steady in others. Builders who believe the market has turned are preparing sites now in the hopes their projects will come online when higher rents are firmly established.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city's aging office stock is another factor. Nearly 83 percent of the office buildings in Manhattan were built more than three decades ago, according to the real estate company Cassidy Turley, and just 6.6 percent have been built since 1990. Many tenants, particularly law firms and financial services companies, crave new space that can be more efficient and tailored to their needs. Finally, construction costs could fall as union contracts begin expiring over the next few months and contractors push to exclude costly labor rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A year ago people were saying the market was so bad they wouldn't contemplate ground-up construction,'' said John F. Powers, the chairman of the New York tri-state region for <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>. ''But now, there is upward pressure on rents in some segments of the market, and certainly there is no more downward pressure, so developers are beginning to run pro formas again,'' he said, referring to the method of estimating a project's cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first quarter of this year there were 15 office leases in Midtown at rents above $90 a square foot, compared with 23 for all of 2010, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield. At the same time the vacancy rate in Midtown has dropped to 10.3 percent, compared with 12.6 percent at this time last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tenants considering locking in new space now, before rents rise further, include <span class="companylink">Time Warner Inc</span>., the financial services behemoth <span class="companylink">UBS</span> and the law firm <span class="companylink">Mayer Brown</span>. According to Cassidy Turley there are 446 tenants in the market chasing less than 28 million square feet of space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Particularly well-poised are those developers who had begun preparing before the recession and can resume construction now at points further along. Pacolet Milliken Enterprises, the sister company of the textile firm <span class="companylink">Milliken &amp; Company</span>, demolished the building at 1045 Avenue of the Americas, a full block between West 39th and West 40th Streets, in 2009. The company has completed the schematic design for a 350,000-square-foot office building at the now-vacant lot, and has hired the Houston-based real estate firm Hines as a consultant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We feel very confident about the market and the location,'' said Richard C. Webel, Pacolet Milliken's president. He said the company had been speaking preliminarily with tenants, though it had not yet hired a broker. As for timing, ''based on who we have talked to, the market should be there by 2015 or 2016, if not sooner,'' Mr. Webel said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Timing is critical as the market starts to revive, experts said. ''The first buildings to be up and running will be most successful in grabbing an anchor tenant,'' said Robert Sammons, the vice president for research services at Cassidy Turley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boston Properties is banking on this as it revives construction on a 1-million-square-foot office tower at 250 West 55th Street; building stopped in 2008 after the foundation was poured. Since it is partially built, it will be a relatively short time -- mid-2014 -- until Boston Properties can deliver the building to tenants. Already, it is in lease negotiations with the law firm Morrison Foerster as an anchor tenant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another tower that is being closely watched is 20 Times Square. <span class="companylink">Vornado Realty Trust</span> has had a plan for the 1.25 million-square-foot office building, which will be built over the Port Authority Bus Terminal, for several years. Steven Roth, Vornado's chairman, recently said he would consider erecting the tower before signing an anchor tenant, thanks in part to a multimillion-dollar cash infusion from an unnamed investor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not all of the new construction is in Midtown. In Greenwich Village, Edward J. Minskoff Equities is expecting to break ground this summer on 51 Astor Place, a 430,000-square-foot mixed-use mixed-use office building. ''With technology getting hot again, and Midtown South having the lowest vacancy rate in the country at 8 percent, a new building in the vicinity should do well,'' Kenneth J. McCarthy, the senior economist and senior managing director for research at Cushman &amp; Wakefield, said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another factor that could spur development is coming contract negotiations between the construction trade unions and contractors. Thirty labor-contractor collective bargaining agreements are set to expire on June 30, and contractors are pressing for significant cost reductions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already, builders have been increasingly using nonunion laborers for projects, and among the sticking points will be what some contractors and owners consider archaic and costly work rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One part of the equation is rents, but the other part, which is very important, is the cost of construction,'' Mr. Powers said. While it would be a boon for developers if labor costs were reduced, the fight is expected to be tough, said John Krush, an executive managing director at Newmark Knight Frank Project &amp; Development Management. There is a possibility that unions could call for work stoppages, and ''a stoppage of any length -- one month, one week -- would be incredibly costly for developers,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Negotiations are just beginning, and it is far too soon to speculate about whether there will be work stoppages, or what may or may not happen,'' said Gary LaBarbera, the president of the Building and Construction Trades Council of Greater New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, office development seems poised to rebound. ''There are several players who have financing, who have the land, and have been waiting on the sidelines for some indications that the market is improving,'' Mr. Sammons said. For those builders, ''the time is now.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing prices slid back in February to their lowest level of the downturn, fresh proof -- as if any were needed -- that real estate remains one of the most troubled sectors of the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case-Shiller Home Price Index for 20 metropolitan areas dropped 1.1 percent from January, S.&amp; P. said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the barest of margins, the index failed to plumb new depths. It is now at 139.27, essentially the same as the low of 139.26 that it reached in April 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing prices are falling even though banks have been pulling back on foreclosures, which generally drive neighborhood prices down. They are falling despite low interest rates, which make houses more affordable. And they are falling even though they have already dropped by a third from their heady peaks in mid-decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It looks pretty bad,'' the chairman of the S.&amp; P. index committee, David M. Blitzer, said. ''Could it get a little worse? Sure. Could it get a whole lot worse, so everywhere looks the way Detroit looks now? To get there, you'd have to paint a really, really grim picture.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another devastating recession, perhaps? Potential buyers scorning en masse the notion of ownership? Mr. Blitzer does not see those happening.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This will be small comfort for anyone trying to sell in this environment, or merely wondering where the money for retirement will come from. Washington was the only Case-Shiller city where prices went up over the last year. But even it dropped slightly in February. Ten of the cities in the index, including Atlanta, Charlotte, Chicago, New York and Seattle, hit a low for the cycle during the month. That was one fewer than January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Detroit was the exception. Why Detroit, by far the worst housing market in the country, rose when everywhere else was sliding is a statistical mystery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the 20 cities, prices are down 3.3 percent in the last 12 months. That is not much compared to the precipitous drops of 2008 and 2009 but some see the declines accelerating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Capital Economics, a forecasting group in Toronto, previously said prices would drop about 5 percent this year. ''That forecast is looking increasingly realistic,'' Paul Dales, a senior United States economist, wrote in a note to clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another 5 percent decline in the index would take it back to about 133. While that equates to a 33 percent gain for homeowners since 2000, it is just about nothing after inflation is factored in. And those would be the lucky ones, who bought long ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most economists think the market is in transition to something resembling stability, although few expect genuine price increases anytime soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Things are moving in the direction of getting better,'' said Eric Fox, vice president for statistical and economic modeling for the consultant Veros.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the helpful trends: The oversupply of houses that characterized the early stages of the downturn is gradually being absorbed, the employment situation is marginally better and interest rates are not increasing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Veros is forecasting that stronger markets, including Pittsburgh, Buffalo and Shreveport, La., will increase 2 to 3 percent over the next year, while the weakest markets will fall about 5 percent. Weak markets include Las Vegas, Orlando, Fla., and Portland, Ore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Foreclosures are the big unknown,'' Mr. Fox said. ''If there is a huge influx, that can have an effect.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller index, which measures repeat sales of houses, is an imperfect measure of the real estate market. The index is a three-month moving average, so the February results include December and January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other indexes also describe a troubled market, however. The <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span>'s index, which is calculated using the purchase prices of houses with mortgages that have been sold to or guaranteed by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> or <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, the government loan repositories, is declining at a faster rate than previously.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The F.H.F.A. index fell 1.6 percent in February from the previous month, the agency said last week, while the January decline was revised up to 1 percent. In the last year, the index has fallen nearly 6 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If some troubled owners are beginning to reject the notion of homeownership, a few renters are sensing this might be their moment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Talking about how the recession is bad for home builders and sellers ignores an entire segment of the country for whom this is a blessing,'' said Abby Eagye, 41.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A writer, skiing instructor and emergency medical worker, Ms. Eagye lives in Aspen, Colo., where the wealthy roam. But the crash has yielded some surprising deals. Ms. Eagye is pulling together a down payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I missed the real estate window once and I don't care to do it again,'' she said. ''I have no false dreams of flipping homes to make money. I just want the safety of owning my own home.''</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Civic Group Says That Concessions Are Needed From the Construction Unions</span>
</div><div class="author">By CHARLES V. BAGLI </div><div>944 words</div><div>25 April 2011</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>19</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A prominent civic group has joined builders and real estate executives in calling for major concessions from the unions that dominate the construction industry, saying cuts are needed to allow major projects to move forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group, the Regional Plan Association, is supported by corporations, including some connected to real estate, and by planning groups in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. It is a respected organization known more for advocacy on transportation issues and large public works than for taking sides in labor matters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the association has quietly circulated a 51-page report saying that the expiration of 30 union contracts in June presents a chance to reform the $25 billion unionized construction industry by eliminating what the report calls obsolete work rules and featherbedding; by adopting a standard eight-hour day for all building trades; and by reducing benefit packages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Members of the association are scheduled to present the report, ''Construction Labor Costs in New York City -- A Moment of Opportunity,'' to Deputy Mayors Stephen Goldsmith and Robert K. Steel on Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Given the wrenching changes in the real estate industry since the recession,'' said Robert Yaro, the president of the Regional Plan Association, ''a growing number of builders have found that they can no longer support high labor costs.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is not about what union workers are paid,'' he added. ''It's about work rules and productivity. Those are things that should be changed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The labor negotiations come at a critical time for the construction industry, as a growing number of buildings in the city are being constructed with cheaper, nonunion labor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Building Trades Employers' Association, a group that represents contractors, has paid for subway advertisements and a Web site directly appealing to union members to agree to concessions, angering union leadership in the process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This month, 400 union construction workers held a noisy protest outside the Taj Pierre Hotel as Sam Zell, founder of Equity Residential Properties, arrived for a speaking engagement. Mr. Zell's company is building an apartment building at 500 West 23rd Street with nonunion labor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The construction unions dismissed the report, saying its authors were antagonistic to labor unions. They were referring to Julia Vitullo-Martin and Hope Cohen, former associates of the conservative Manhattan Institute who now work at the Regional Plan Association and prepared the report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''So individuals with longstanding right-wing, anti-worker associations and views want to blame labor for our economic problems,'' said Paul Fernandes, a spokesman for Gary LaBarbera, president of the Building and Construction Trades Council, a union umbrella group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This draft report is rife with factual errors and omissions that reveal its underlying ideology,'' he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The only thing missing from this piece of garbage is the Koch brothers and the governor of Wisconsin.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The once cordial relationship between Mr. LaBarbera, whose group represents about 100,000 workers, and Louis J. Coletti, president of the Building Trades Employers' Association, has become strained. Mr. LaBarbera ''won't sit in the same room with Coletti,'' said a union lawyer who insisted on anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate and construction executives said they were not trying to create a ''Wisconsin,'' referring to political efforts in Wisconsin and elsewhere to strip union workers of bargaining rights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is about saving the industry,'' Mr. Yaro said. ''It is by no means an attack on the unions.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Real Estate Board of New York, a powerful lobbying group that represents most of the city's residential and commercial developers, the contractors' group and now the Regional Plan Association have conducted a campaign to enlist City Hall, in the hope that the mayor would use his influence on their behalf. But the Bloomberg administration has thus far seemed unwilling to insert itself into the labor dispute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The association's report says developers and owners, who absorbed the higher costs of union labor during the real estate boom, are now under pressure to cut costs because of lower rents and stringent financing terms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the report also says that leading developers and contractors are attached to union construction work, in part because ''the best union labor continues to surpass nonunion in skills and productivity,'' and because the jobs provide ''a key channel of upward mobility for millions of Americans.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report describes as archaic various provisions that unions have succeeded in keeping around, in contracts that were also signed by employers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These include the required presence of master mechanics and oilers for heavy equipment like cranes, which have become technologically advanced enough that the mechanics and oilers have very little work to do; and rules that say steamfitters, electricians and plumbers must always be around to monitor heat, electricity and water service, which the report likened to an apartment building having a full-time plumber rather than simply calling one when a leak occurs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report also called for eight-hour shifts to officially begin when a worker reaches his station, not when he arrives at the ground level, an issue in tall construction sites where many men are using a few hoists to get to the floors where they are working.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''To keep union firms competitive, the ongoing labor contract negotiations -- and reformed work rule practices -- must bring the union-nonunion differential closer to 10 percent from the current 20-30 percent,'' the report says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If this does not happen, nonunion labor is likely to gain an ever-increasing share of the market, forcing union developers and contractors to accept open-shop arrangements or leave the construction business.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RICHMOND, Ill. -- In this distant Chicago suburb, a builder has finally found a way to persuade people to buy a new house: he throws in a car.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kim Meier's spring promotion, which includes a $17,000 credit at a nearby General Motors dealer, has produced seven sales since the beginning of March, a veritable windfall of business for a builder who sold only 20 houses last year. ''We needed to do something dramatic,'' said Mr. Meier. ''The market's been soft.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is one way of putting it. The recession hurt a lot of industries, but it knocked the residential construction market to the mat and has kept it there, even as the broader economy has started to fitfully recover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of new single-family homes in February were down more than 80 percent from the 2005 peak, far exceeding the 28 percent drop in existing home sales. New single-family sales are now lower than at any point since the data was first collected in 1963, when the nation had 120 million fewer residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders and analysts say a long-term shift in behavior seems to be under way. Instead of wanting the biggest and the newest, even if it requires a long commute, buyers now demand something smaller, cheaper and, thanks to $4-a-gallon gas, as close to their jobs as possible. That often means buying a home out of foreclosure from a bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four out of 10 sales of existing homes are foreclosures or otherwise distressed properties. Builders like Mr. Meier who specialize in putting up entire neighborhoods on a city's outskirts -- Richmond is some 50 miles northwest of downtown Chicago -- cannot compete despite chopping prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chicago was not an epicenter of the housing boom with the sort of overbuilding found in Arizona or Florida, but new-home sales in the metro area are down 90 percent. There are about 65 sales a week for a region of 10 million people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several factors have combined to make the Chicago market so weak. There were more subprime loans here, which meant more defaults, which in turn left more distressed homes for buyers to choose from.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the construction here was done by private builders. Unlike the national firms, they did not have the resources to survive a prolonged downturn. ''Some of the private builders just evaporated, and some said the hell with it,'' said Tracy Cross, a consultant who tracks the local market. Only a few remain, including Mr. Meier's KLM Builders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction of new single-family homes usually surges after a recession because of lower rates and pent-up demand. But the Census Bureau said this week that while multi-unit construction had picked up strongly in the last year, single-family home construction fell 21 percent to an annual rate of 422,000. One consequence of the anemic pace: more than 1.4 million residential construction jobs have been lost in the last five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Barycki is one of a handful of buyers keeping the market from drying up completely. He's 30, a partner in a hardware store, and currently living with his parents. He was drawn by the new-car offer to the biggest of KLM's four active developments, called Sunset Ridge Estates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My money was in the bank, collecting very little interest, so I thought I might as well take a little gamble,'' said Mr. Barycki, who is paying $182,000 for a three-bedroom. ''Eventually, home-owning will come back.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eventually, no doubt. But in the meantime, sentiment might still be souring. Executives at Equity LifeStyle Properties, a Chicago firm that sells properties in resort communities, said this week they were seeing ''a psychological change'': potential customers wanted to preserve their capital rather than risk it in real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bill McBride, who runs the popular financial blog Calculated Risk, said this might be the moment when people decisively started to turn on home ownership. ''I'm starting to feel the hate,'' he wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In such an atmosphere, every new home built and sold represents a victory. One of the few segments of the market that has shown signs of life is urban townhomes. Lennar, a national builder, has one of these developments under way in the upscale community of Arlington Heights, about 20 miles from downtown Chicago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then Pulte, another national builder, started construction on its own townhouse community a few miles away, even as it was recording a 2010 third-quarter loss of a billion dollars. In the meantime, Lennar cut its prices by another 10 percent, but sales in the fourth quarter barely budged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lennar says its sales have picked up and it is drawing customers from people who looked at Pulte's project and passed. Pulte says the same thing about Lennar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's brutal out there,'' said Mr. Cross, the consultant. ''You have to put on your boxing gloves.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some victories may be brief. Builders say buyers have been acting ahead of a small rise in mortgage insurance premiums from the Federal Housing Administration, which backs many purchases. That mini-rush to lock in a deal might lift March sales figures for new homes, which are due out Monday, analysts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Meier, who has been building in this stretch near the Wisconsin border for 25 years, hopes the car promotion will put a floor under his market. In flush times, he would sell about 100 houses a year to a diverse group of buyers, from empty nesters to commuters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richmond bills itself as a ''Village of Yesteryear,'' which has come true in another way as house prices roll back to the mid-1990s. But some KLM buyers look for more, choosing to skip the car and put the $17,000 into the house instead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is what Wayne and Doris Powrozek, who are paying $193,000 for a three-bedroom, did. ''If it's free, it's for me,'' said Mr. Powrozek, who recently retired from <span class="companylink">AT&amp;T</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Powrozeks bought because they were worried prices were going up. Mr. Meier says he thinks they must -- the cost of raw materials is rising. But with the price of existing homes continuing to fall, and the prospect of more foreclosures, he could again price himself out of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like nearly all those in real estate, Mr. Meier is determinedly optimistic. ''Everybody wants in at the top, no one wants in at the bottom,'' he said. ''People are paralyzed by their fear.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, KLM told buyers it would match the government's $8,000 tax credit. The car promotion more than doubles that. If the market still does not turn around, what could be their next promotion?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Buy one, get one free,'' his wife, Sally, suggested. They had a good laugh over that.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Multigenerational Housing Is a Real Estate Growth Niche</span>
</div><div class="author">By AARON GLANTZ </div><div>1179 words</div><div>22 April 2011</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>National Edition</div><div>21A</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taylor Morrison, a housing developer based in Arizona, was set to break ground on a 304-unit condominium development in Sunnyvale, near San Jose, when the bottom fell out of the housing market in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company went back to the drawing board, and last month it gained approval for a drastically different plan: a town house project aimed at extended families, where children, parents and grandparents can all live comfortably under one roof.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such multigenerational housing is specifically aimed at the booming immigrant population in the Bay Area, and is emerging as one of the few growth niches in a moribund housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you're selling in certain areas of the Bay Area, you have to be more extended-family-oriented,'' said Cheryl O'Conner, government affairs consultant to the Building Industry Association of the Bay Area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asian buyers, in particular, ''come with the whole family,'' Ms. O'Conner said. ''They come with their parents and grandparents, uncles, aunts and cousins.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even when several generations are not living together permanently, more and more families are looking for housing alternatives that can readily accommodate extended visits from overseas relatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Census figures released last month show the Bay Area's Hispanic and Asian populations each increased by more than 350,000 over the past decade, while the region's non-Hispanic white population declined. Those groups are about twice as likely as whites to live in multigenerational households, according to a 2010 study by the Pew Hispanic Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2008, an estimated 49 million Americans lived in a house that included at least two adult generations or a grandparent and at least one other generation, the study showed. In 1980, that figure was just 28 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Immigrants are a source of growing demand, and their household composition is different in fundamental ways from the domestic-born,'' said Kermit Baker, a senior fellow at the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard and the chief economist of the American Institute of Architects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Taylor Morrison's development in Sunnyvale, called Duane Court, most units will be approximately 2,000 square feet, featuring a bedroom and a bathroom on the ground floor so older-generation residents do not have to use the stairs; a kitchen, a living room and a dining room on the middle floor; and three additional bedrooms and two bathrooms on the top floor for the traditional nuclear family unit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Local officials are enthusiastic about the trend. Melinda Hamilton, mayor of Sunnyvale, said the new project ''has more community support because it's more in tune with the neighborhood, and it provides what we need: housing for families.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such designs are particularly popular in the South Bay, observers say, because of the large influx of engineers from China and India who want large homes to accommodate their extended families and who can afford an expensive new townhome.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But multigeneration housing is gaining popularity in less wealthy neighborhoods, too. In East Oakland, the developer Korin Crawford finished a nine-unit townhome development with a design similar to Duane Court's in 2009; he was unable to sell the units in the middle of the housing bust but has rented them out and is pushing ahead with similar projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Third Street in the Bayview district of San Francisco, the affordable-housing developer Bridge Housing completed its 124-unit Armstrong Townhome project in 2009. Seventy units have sold, and Bridge Housing's project director, Kevin Griffith, said he believed the rest would sell by early next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Griffith said his company's architects were also mindful of multigenerational needs, designing some units with a bedroom and a full bath on the main level so the elderly could avoid the stairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Design preferences can vary among ethnicities, social classes and income levels. Amar Gupta, managing editor of the Indian-interest magazine Siliconeer, is not convinced that South Asian immigrants will go for town houses like those at Duane Court, for example, because they prefer large, detached single-family homes built across either one or two floors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you want to have the older generation, you can't have stairs,'' said Mr. Gupta, whose home includes seven residents across four generations, from his 78-year-old grandmother, Shanti, to his two sons, 11-year-old Vanish and 5-year-old Janam.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gupta's family rents a 3,500-square-foot home off Mission Boulevard in Fremont. Most of the bedrooms are on the second floor, but his grandmother's is on the ground floor with the kitchen, the living room and the den.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's slightly different than the American system of living,'' he said, ''but that's how we do it in India: we put culture and family first.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gupta's father, Ashok, a real estate agent who specializes in South Asian families, said the three-story townhomes with a bedroom and a bathroom on the ground floor were ''perfect for an engineer in Silicon Valley whose mother is going to come for a few months a year.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The rest of the year, they can use it for an office,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sandra Vivanco, a San Francisco architect, also sees a growth market for properties that allow for comfortable extended visits by family members. Ms. Vivanco designed a house in Menlo Park where a couple -- the husband is Sri Lankan and the wife Finnish -- live with two young children. When the Finnish grandmother returns to Europe, the Sri Lankan grandfather arrives from Asia. Sometimes, both come at the same time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the composition of the household keeps changing, Ms. Vivanco said, the home's design had to be flexible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is no master suite in the house, just four equally sized large bedrooms with bathrooms that are easy to share,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are two equally sized bathrooms next to each other,'' Ms. Vivanco said, ''one with a shower and a toilet and the other with a bathtub and a toilet. Outside in the hallway, there is a double sink, so four people can use the bathroom at the same time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She added, ''Our normally held ideas of privacy are being questioned and reinterpreted.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Vivanco also designed a two-story house for an elderly Salvadoran couple and their three grown children in the city's Excelsior district.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We don't see it as a bad thing that we're all grown up and still living with our parents,'' said Lizzette Henriquez, 47, one of the three adult siblings. ''We're helping each other.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's part of our culture,'' said Ms. Henriquez's brother, Juan Carlos, 43, who moved in last August after living for a decade in an apartment near Golden Gate Park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's no negative,'' he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which has consolidated departments and reduced its payroll under severe financial pressure, now plans to sell its headquarters and two adjoining buildings on Madison Avenue in a deal that it says could reap more than $150 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Transportation officials are hoping that a developer will pay top dollar for the properties, three 20-story office buildings that form the eastern blockfront between 44th and 45th Streets. A buyer could demolish the structures and erect a modern skyscraper, and could also buy unused development rights over Grand Central Terminal and build an even taller tower than might otherwise be allowed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The point is, it's a valuable asset,'' said Jeffrey B. Rosen, the transportation authority's director of real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decision comes as developers are beginning to shake off a three-year hibernation following the collapse of a speculative real estate boom in 2008. Investors are once again buying office buildings, while developers are looking to revive dormant projects or start new ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three buildings might look bland and unappealing, but the allure is their location in a prime office district next to Grand Central, a workday entry point for executives coming from New York's northern suburbs. The Yale Club is on the same square block.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the buildings -- 341, 345 and 347 Madison Avenue -- may not be of architectural note, the authority's headquarters and its hearing rooms have been the site of many a raucous demonstration, by employees, transit riders opposed to fare increases and cuts in service, or opponents of development on authority properties. It bought 347 Madison in 1979 for $11.9 million and 341 and 345 Madison in 1991 for $12.25 million and $23.75 million respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The transportation authority considered selling the buildings before, in 1998 and in 2005, but decided against it each time. ''I'd take a look,'' the developer Douglas Durst said Tuesday, ''for the third time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rosen said a sale, or possibly a long-term lease, would happen this time. Jay H. Walder, the authority's chairman, has streamlined departments, cutting 3,500 positions in the last year from its New York City Transit, <span class="companylink">Metro-North Railroad</span> and <span class="companylink">Long Island Rail Road</span> operations. The authority is also evaluating its space needs at 26 other buildings it owns or leases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 20 percent of the job cuts were at the authority's headquarters. The plan is to move many of the remaining 873 employees at the buildings on Madison Avenue to 2 Broadway, a 30-story building between Beaver and Stone Streets in the financial district where the authority already has nearly 4,200 employees, including the New York City Transit administration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The transportation authority said that a sale could generate ''substantially'' more than $150 million for the properties, an estimate that appraisers and real estate executives did not dispute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter S. Kalikow, who was chairman of the authority from 2001 to 2007, said he had decided not to sell the buildings when he was in charge because they housed the Metro-North administration, which he believed should remain close to Grand Central. ''Moving New York City Transit to 2 Broadway is best thing we ever did,'' he said in an interview this week. ''But there are no Metro-North trains down there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The authority, however, says that if it sold the headquarters buildings, it would find new space for Metro-North somewhere in the Midtown area. The <span class="companylink">Long Island Rail Road</span> offices are at its hub in Jamaica, Queens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, the authority agreed to sell the development rights over its West Side Yards for $1 billion to Related Companies and the rights over its Brooklyn property that forms part of the Atlantic Yards project for $100 million to Forest City Ratner. But the money has been slow to come because of the recession and a restructuring of the deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, the transportation authority has gotten $20 million from the Brooklyn sale and $20.9 million from Related, which has also put $32.6 million in escrow for the deal, with another $10.9 million due next month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the timing might be right for the authority. Dan Fasulo, director of research at <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>, said the real estate market was showing signs of life, with vacancy rates falling at prime office buildings in Manhattan and few large blocks of space available anymore. Rising rents are prompting some developers to build, rather than buy existing buildings, which might make the authority's sites attractive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Tenants today are asking for all the bells and whistles in new buildings,'' Mr. Fasulo said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By REUTERS   </div><div>439 words</div><div>21 April 2011</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>The New York Times on the Web</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of previously owned homes in the United States rose more than expected in March, a trade group said Wednesday, raising cautious optimism about the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said sales rose 3.7 percent month over month to an annual rate of 5.10 million units after an upwardly revised pace of 4.92 million units in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists polled by Reuters had expected sales to rise 2.5 percent to a 5-million-unit pace from the previously reported 4.88-million-unit rate. Sales have now risen in six of the last eight months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's slow, steady progress, but you cannot not be disturbed by the slow pace of recovery,'' said Pierre Ellis, an economist at Decision Economics in New York. ''Demand is rising even with higher mortgage rates so that's encouraging.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market is struggling to find its footing as a wave of foreclosed properties keeps supply elevated and prices depressed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, foreclosures and short sales, which typically occur at about 20 percent below market value, accounted for 40 percent of transactions. That was the highest since April 2009 and was up from 39 percent in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median home price fell 5.9 percent in March from a year earlier, to $159,600. Compared with March last year, sales were down 6.3 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A sustained turnaround in the housing market is still far off based on earlier-released depressed readings for housing starts, building permits and builders' confidence indices,'' said Krishen Rangasamy, an economist at CIBC World Markets in Toronto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report on Wednesday showed demand for home loans rose last week, as interest rates eased and purchase activity picked up. The Mortgage Bankers Association said its purchase index rose 10 percent to 210.8, the highest since early December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, all-cash purchases made up a record 35 percent of sales in March and the NAR said the lower and upper ends of the market were showing strong activity, with the middle part remaining sluggish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales last month rose across the board, with multifamily dwellings rising 1.6 percent and single-family home units advancing 4 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At March's sales pace, the supply of existing homes on the market slipped to 8.4 months' worth, from 8.5 months in February. However, the number of previously owned homes on the market rose 1.5 percent, to 3.55 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A supply of six to seven months is generally considered ideal, with higher readings pointing to lower house prices.</p>

</div><div class="author">By REUTERS   </div><div>642 words</div><div>21 April 2011</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big earnings surprises gave Wall Street a positive spin on Wednesday, propelling shares to their best day in a month and lifting the Dow industrials to their highest in almost three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors had been set up for a series of disappointments but got an unexpected lift from two bellwether companies -- Intel and United Technologies -- helping to spur a broad-based rally that put equities on the path for more gains in coming weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Until yesterday, earnings were lackluster, not too exciting, even disappointing,'' said Nick Kalivas, senior equity index analyst at <span class="companylink">MF Global</span>. He said the last round of reports ''shifted the psychology quite significantly.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of Intel rose 7.8 percent to $21.41 while United Technology gained 4.3 percent to $85.90.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average had gained 186.79 points, or 1.52 percent, to 12,453.54. The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> 500-stock index rose 17.74 points, or 1.35 percent, to 1,330.36. The Nasdaq, driven by Intel, added 57.54 points, or 2.10 percent, to 2,802.51.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Nasdaq posted its largest daily percentage gain since Octobe, while the Dow hit its highest close since early June 2008. The S.&amp; P. 500 had its best performance in a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">European shares also closed sharply higher, with the FTSE 100 in London adding 2.1 percent and the DAX in Frankfurt gaining almost 3 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a second day, investors in the United States received some positive news about the housing market in the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said that the sale of existing homes in March rose 3.7 percent from February to an annual rate of 5.10 million units. Economists had expected a smaller increase to a five million unit pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the median home price fell 5.9 percent in March from a year earlier to $159,600.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The underlying trend for existing home sales is improving, but only at a gradual pace,'' said Michael Gapen, an economist at <span class="companylink">Barclays Capital</span> in New York. ''Demand should gradually firm as labor market conditions continue to improve.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, the Commerce Department said that home construction rose 7.2 percent in March from February to a seasonally adjusted 549,000 units a year. Building permits, an indicator of future construction, rose 11.2 percent after hitting a five-decade low in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trend of positive earnings continued after the market's close on Wednesday and could help spur another rally on Thursday, the last trading day before the Easter holiday. Apple rose 2.7 percent in after-hours trading after a blowout quarter that surged past expectations. Revenue for the technology giant rose 83 percent from the quarter a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">F5 Networks</span>, considered a momentum favorite for investors, climbed 7.3 percent to $99.74 after its second-quarter profit topped expectations and the company forecast third-quarter earnings largely above estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">American Express</span> rose 0.8 percent to $47, recovering from earlier losses. While the company's profit topped expectations, expenses at the credit card company rose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I.B.M. slipped 0.4 percent to $164.75 after reporting a drop in signings of new business at its global services division during the first quarter. Its profit and revenue, however, came in above analysts' projections, and it raised its full-year profit view.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the bond market, Treasury prices fell Wednesday as investors preferred riskier assets. The price of the 10-year Treasury note fell 12/32, while the yield rose to 3.41 percent from 3.36 percent late Tuesday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders broke ground last month on the most new homes in six months, giving the weak housing market a slight lift.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said on Tuesday that home construction rose 7.2 percent in March from February to a seasonally adjusted 549,000 units a year. Building permits, an indicator of future construction, rose 11.2 percent after hitting a five-decade low in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the building pace is far below the 1.2 million units a year that economists consider healthy. And March's improvement came after construction fell in February to its second-lowest level on records dating back more than a half-century.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Millions of foreclosures have forced home prices down. In some cities, prices are half of what they were before the housing market collapsed in 2006 and 2007. And more foreclosures are expected this year. Tight credit has made mortgage loans difficult to get, and many would-be buyers who could qualify for loans are reluctant to shop, fearing that prices will fall even further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A sign of the battered industry is the number of new homes finished and ready to sell dropped in March to a seasonally adjusted 509,000 units, the lowest level on records dating back to 1968. And the number of homes now under construction has fallen to a four-decade low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family homes, which make up roughly 80 percent of home construction, rose 7.7 percent in March. Apartment and condominium construction rose 14.7 percent. Building permits increased to the highest level since December, spurred by a more than 28 percent jump in permits granted for apartment and condo buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase in home construction activity was felt in most regions of the country. It rose 32.3 percent in the Midwest, 27.6 percent in the West and 5.4 percent in the Northeast. Construction fell 3.3 percent in the South.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Home Builders, the trade group, said Monday that its index of industry sentiment for April fell one notch, to 16. That followed a one-point increase in March and four months of 16 readings. Any reading below 50 indicates negative sentiment about the housing market's future; the index has not been above that level since April 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most economists expect home prices -- and by extension home sales and construction -- to slip even further in 2011 before a modest recovery takes hold.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CHARLESTON, S.C. -- A plan to open a new cruise ship terminal next year has ignited a debate over the future of this historic city. Supporters of the project, including Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr., say it will help open up an underused stretch of waterfront to public and private development. Opponents, among them preservation groups, downtown homeowners and real estate agents, counter that a huge influx of new visitors would overwhelm the city's cultivated charm and hurt home values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, a $2.4 million contract to design the new terminal, which will cost $25 million, was awarded to a Colorado company, <span class="companylink">CH2M Hill</span>. The company plans to convert an empty 100,000-square-foot steel warehouse at the north end of the 67-acre Union Pier complex to replace the existing 18,000-square-foot cinder block terminal, built in 1973, at the south end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The terminal is seen as an essential step in what the <span class="companylink">South Carolina State Ports Authority</span>, the project's developer, says will be a much larger demolition and mixed-use development project that will divide the Union Pier complex in two. Twenty-two acres at the north end is reserved for the terminal and parking for cruise ship passengers. Some eight acres of pilings and concrete deck would be removed. And 35 acres of shoreline property with exquisite views of the harbor will be made available for private development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our vision is to extend the city grid to the waterfront,'' said Mayor Riley, a 68-year-old Democrat first elected in 1975. ''There will be a combination of public spaces, waterfront access, residential and commercial development. We have the conceptual plan. It's the starting point for a new part of Charleston that begins along the water's edge, and from there mixes uses in a low-rise 18th- and 19th-century-scale city.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Opponents say their concerns center on what the new terminal is supposed to achieve: enhancing Charleston's growing reputation as a destination and a home port for cruise ships. This year the port expects 175,000 passengers from 90 cruises, up from 69 cruises and 111,000 passengers in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The critics, among them the Preservation Society of Charleston; the Historic Charleston Foundation; and some of the city's most prominent real estate agents, hotel owners and downtown homeowners, say the growing number of cruise passengers could hurt residential real estate sales, run roughshod over the city's historic charm and character, and detract from the new shoreline development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The prescription for a high-quality destination does not include being overrun with cruise ships,'' said P. Steven Dopp, the president of the Portwood Properties Corporation, the principal owner of the 12-story, 87-year-old Francis Marion Hotel, one of Charleston's grandest. ''The scale of the ships and the number of people dumped on the street -- it's not what Charleston was or wants to be.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dana Beach, the executive director of the Coastal Conservation League, said: ''Union Pier is some of the most valuable real estate in the South. Using almost half for a terminal and surface parking for passengers is absurd.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The debate over the port's plan reflects the vigilance that Charlestonians exhibit over development projects big and small. In the 1980s, in a similarly heated struggle, preservationists and city officials tussled over the height of Charleston Place, a 441-room hotel at the center of the historic area. The hotel was opened in 1986 with eight stories, six fewer than the 14 initially proposed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The debate over preservation aside, Charleston has fared better than most during the downturn. The marine terminal is one of three active public sector projects intended to strengthen the tourism industry, valued by the city at $3 billion annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just north and west of Union Pier, the Gaillard Municipal Auditorium, a theater and exhibition center built in 1968, awaits a $142 million renovation and expansion. The 2,726-seat auditorium will lose 900 seats and the roof will be raised to incorporate boxes and three levels of balcony. The 119,000-square foot building will expand to 261,000 square feet. The project includes constructing a 84,000-square-foot addition to house city offices and staff. The city is financing half of the construction; the other half is being raised privately, led by a $20 million gift from a donor who has asked to remain anonymous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seven blocks south, the Charleston City Market, which dates to the early 19th century, is undergoing a $5 million renovation that is close to completion. The market, owned by the city, is leased and managed by City Market Preservation Trust. Hank Holliday, one of three principals, who also operates three hotels and several restaurants in the market area, said the company undertook the publicly financed renovation ''in self defense.'' The four brick buildings, three of them open-air, had deteriorated significantly enough that they had the potential to affect property values, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The renovation, which has taken two years, involved a painstaking process of local review that accompanies every development in Charleston's historic district. That strengthened the restoration project, said Mr. Holliday, who also opposes the growing cruise ship business in Charleston and worries about its influence on the historic district, which includes the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said increasing the number of cruise ships and passengers had the potential to discourage local residents from visiting downtown restaurants, living in the historic homes and shopping in Charleston's distinctive stores.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm not aware of any city that had its quality of life or environment enhanced by the presence of cruise ships,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That sentiment, though, is not widely shared by the vendors and sales staff in shops in the area around the market. ''We do get people who come through and get on a cruise and then come back because they find Charleston irresistible,'' said Ann Spann, the sales coordinator for the Birds I View Gallery, two blocks from the market. ''It's wonderful to have the ships here. It's not hurting Charleston, I can tell you that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Debates over the effects of the cruise industry on Charleston's character have flared occasionally since 1973, when the existing terminal opened, as the number of dockings increased, then ebbed as cruise numbers declined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discord reached a new level of intensity in September 2009 when the <span class="companylink">Carnival Corporation</span> announced that Union Pier would be the home port for the 855-foot, 2,056-passenger Carnival Fantasy, which arrived in May 2010 for its initial five-, six-, and seven-day home port cruises to Key West, Fla., and the Bahamas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By then, the State Ports Authority and its new president and chief executive, James Newsome III, had already begun an intensive $1.3 million planning process, involving dozens of meetings with community groups, to replace the old passenger terminal and consider new uses for Union Pier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last September, the Charleston City Council unanimously approved the port's proposal to establish the terminal at the north end of Union Pier and turn the south end into a new residential neighborhood. In addition, Mr. Newsome reached an informal agreement with Mayor Riley to limit voluntarily the number of ships calling on the port to 104 annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dopp and other critics of the cruise industry said many of their fears would vanish if the verbal agreement were put in writing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, The Post and Courier, the city's newspaper, published an editorial on Sunday, the third in as many months, that urged the city to respond to what it said was growing public concern about cruise ship operations and the location of the new marine terminal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Instead of shrugging their shoulders and professing to have no authority in the matter, city officials should look for ways to protect the peninsula from potential erosion of its quality of life,'' said the newspaper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Riley said a formal limit on cruise ships was unnecessary because cruise ship passengers made up less than 4 percent of the city's 4.5 million annual visitors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Newsome said he, too, was comfortable with a voluntary limit. ''The port is a business,'' he said, ''and businesses don't typically accept regulation on the amount of business they do.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: April 23, 2011, Saturday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article in the Square Feet pages on Wednesday about debate over a plan to build another cruise ship terminal in Charleston, S.C., misstated the terms of an informal agreement between the city and the State Ports Authority over the frequency of port calls by the ships. It allows 104 calls annually; it does not limit them to two a week.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Updated, 3:46 p.m. | It's one of the oldest tricks in real estate: pretend that a property is in a more desirable neighborhood and demand more rent or a higher sale price. In other words, advertise that an apartment is in, say, Prospect Heights rather than Crown Heights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When brokers cannot do that, some make up a whole new name, like ProCro for the area between Prospect Heights and Crown Heights. Or they rename places like the South Bronx "SoBro" and South Harlem "SoHa."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Assemblyman Hakeem Jeffries, a Brooklyn Democrat, has little patience for this kind of broker babble. He said he would introduce a bill next week to require a series of approvals for new neighborhood names - from the community board, the City Council and the mayor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His bill would also punish real estate brokers who promoted property with an unofficial, made-up name. The bill calls for fines and the possible suspension or revocation of brokers' licenses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he was simply trying to bring order to the chaos out there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's the Wild West in New York City right now," he said. "Brokers are allowed to essentially pull names out of thin air in order to rebrand a neighborhood and have the effect of raising rents or home prices."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jeffries said that the problem started when neighborhoods like NoLita were carved out of Little Italy. He says he was no happier when brokers started calling southern Harlem "SoHa," the South Bronx "SoBro," and parts of Sunset Park "Greenwood Heights" because of its proximity to Greenwood Cemetery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Some real estate brokers have found it's more desirable to rename a neighborhood after the dead than those who are living," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jeffries said he had tried to contact the Real Estate Board of New York but had not received a reply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Slattery, senior vice president at the real estate board, responded: "Neighborhood boundaries are difficult to define and always changing. It is difficult to legislate the use of an official name when these neighborhood names are not legally defined."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Shields, 43, is the managing director of ING Real Estate Finance (U.S.A.), which has a $6.7 billion portfolio of term loans, construction loans and subordinate debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ING Real Estate Finance is part of the <span class="companylink">ING Group</span> of the Netherlands, which provides banking, investment, life insurance and retirement services worldwide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q What are your duties at ING?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A We're primarily focused on first mortgage originations of commercial real estate's four major food groups: office, retail, residential and industrial. We're like a little company within ING. I run the group, and that pretty much means everything from new deal originations to approving transactions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Are you doing many debt restructurings?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Last year we restructured almost $1.6 billion of our existing portfolio, and that was about 17 transactions. They were just deals with issues. In 2009 it was very difficult to get a restructuring done; the client really didn't know where value was, so you couldn't get a meeting of the minds for how the restructuring should go.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year we've done about three, and I think we'll probably end up doing about nine deals, or $800 million to $900 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Does this drop in deals indicate things are getting better, or that you've gotten most of the restructurings out of the way?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A I think it's both. We've gotten through the bulk of it, and last year we started originating new transactions. This year we're fully in the origination mode.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q What are your projections for loan originations?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Last year nationwide we did about $650 million of new originations -- brand-new deals -- and this year we've already closed about $250 million. We expect to be over $1 billion in originations. It'll just depend on what we see from our key clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right after <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> went down, the new-deal flow stopped; we closed two transactions post Lehman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q So credit is becoming more available now?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A To strong, creditworthy sponsors on high-quality assets in good markets, it's available. For smaller sponsors in smaller markets it's still not that easy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q How much equity are you asking borrowers to put in?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Our loan-to-value ratios have been 60 to 70 percent, so 30 to 40 percent equity. It's pretty high. Last year we were probably looking at deals in the 55 percent L.T.V. range, so it's gotten a little more aggressive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Do you work with other lenders on your deals?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Yes. We're syndicating some loans to different smaller institutions. On the banking side the hold levels have come down post crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Let's move on to the New York market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A We've been very active in the market. I'd say about 15 percent of our portfolio is here -- in Midtown Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the existing portfolio, some situations that we thought were going to be difficult have ended up working out pretty nicely, so we haven't had a lot of major issues here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q You hold the loan for 610 Lexington, on which a <span class="companylink">Shangri-La Hotel</span> and condominium was proposed. What's happening there?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A We're in the process of foreclosing on it. That's one of the transactions that have been more problematic for us.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q And what will happen to the property afterward?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A We're still examining all of our options; there are a lot of things we can do. That site is very high-profile and we're getting a lot of inquiries from everyone -- every major player.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Does ING hold much real estate as a result of foreclosures?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A There's a small loan that was done out of Amsterdam -- it's a land loan -- in Annapolis, Md., and it's pretty small. But that's it. We really haven't had to foreclose on a lot of assets; this is the only one. We don't have a problem owning an asset, but preferably we like to just make loans and not own the assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q There have been a lot of changes within ING, including the recent sale of its real estate investment-management division and the management buyout of ING Clarion. Will this affect your division?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A It's really not going to have any effect on our business going forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q ING is a title sponsor of the New York City Marathon. Have you had a chance to run that race?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A I am scheduled to run the marathon this year. This would be my first time, my first marathon. This might be the last time that ING sponsors it; who knows?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People who have always wondered what it might be like to dabble in a little New York real estate may soon be able to dabble in a lot of it -- by buying a piece of its most famous skyscraper, the Empire State Building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Malkin family, which controls the 102-story Art Deco tower at Fifth Avenue and 34th Street, is planning to create a publicly traded real estate company featuring the building, according to three executives who had been briefed on the plans but spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The skyscraper draws tens of thousands of tourists from across the globe every year to its 86th-floor observatory, 1,050 feet above the city streets. If the Malkin plan is successful, New Yorkers, and anyone else for that matter, will be able to buy stock in the company that owns the Empire State Building, much as Wisconsin residents bought stock in the Green Bay Packers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new company, the executives said, may include a number of other office buildings controlled by Anthony E. Malkin and his father, Peter L. Malkin, including 1 Grand Central, a 55-story, 1.3-million-square-foot building across 42nd Street from Grand Central Terminal, and a 26-story building at 250 West 57th Street, as well as six buildings in Westchester County and Connecticut.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anthony Malkin declined to comment, but he, his father and their partners are hoping to cash in on the Empire State Building's international cachet and a commercial real estate market in New York that is once again attracting buyers from around the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Investors the world over are clamoring to invest in Manhattan office properties, both debt and equity,'' said Michael Knott, a managing director of Green Street Advisors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the Malkins must clear a number of hurdles, not the least of which is gaining the support of their principal partner, the estate of Leona Helmsley, which has hired advisers to evaluate the proposal, and the 3,400 limited partners in the existing company that owns the Empire State Building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A public sale would come amid a sharp rebound in the number of initial public offerings, which roughly tripled in the first quarter of 2011 compared with the same period a year ago. Stock offerings for real estate investment trusts have also surged, with a total volume of $1 billion, more than double the output during the same period last year. But Mr. Knott said that many of those recent offerings had not performed very well after selling in the public markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Empire State Building did not get off to an auspicious start when it opened in 1931, during the Depression. Critics derided it as the ''Empty State Building,'' and it was not profitable until 1950.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Malkin's grandfather Lawrence A. Wien, his father and Harry B. Helmsley created what became a model for real estate syndication when they bought control of the building in 1961 from Henry Crown and leased it to a group of investors, including themselves. Those investors then sold an operating sublease for the tower to another entity now controlled by the Malkins and the estate of Leona Helmsley, while Mr. Helmsley and Mr. Wien sold the title to the property to the Prudential Insurance Company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After years of fighting among the owners and feuds with Donald J. Trump, the Malkins gained full control of the building about five years ago and embarked on what has become a $560 million effort to burnish the 2.9-million-square-foot landmark and more than double the rents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They have renovated the lobby -- restoring original Art Deco murals -- refurbished the observatory and replaced the 6,514 windows as part of an effort to make it one of the city's most energy-efficient buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Malkins and their brokers at Newmark Knight Frank have attracted a series of corporate tenants, including a division of <span class="companylink">Li &amp; Fung</span>, the giant trading firm, which signed a lease for 483,000 square feet in January. There are now about 200 tenants, down from 950 in 2002, though today's tenants occupy far larger spaces. The building may never command rents as high as those at trophies like the General Motors Building, but real estate brokers say the tower now shines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They've moved the building, in my mind, to a Class A property,'' said Peter Riguardi, president of <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> in New York. ''It needed those upgrades. It's now one of the top buildings in that area.''</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">For Flushing and Its Waterfront, Time to Think Big</span>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flushing, Queens, home to one of the largest Asian populations in the United States, is one of the most crowded downtown areas in New York City. The Flushing Main Street stop on the No. 7 subway line was the busiest station outside of Manhattan in 2009, and 19 city bus lines stop downtown, where more than 40,000 people reside.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet there has been relatively little large-scale development in the neighborhood. The glassy towers that dominate other parts of the city are conspicuously absent -- and a municipal parking lot takes up five acres in the center of downtown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People come from China, and when they look at Flushing, they say, 'This is the way China was 15 years ago,' '' said Michael Meyer, the president of TDC Development, a subsidiary of the F&amp;T Group, which plans to turn that parking lot into Flushing Commons, an $820 million, 1.8 million-square-foot mixed-use development. Mr. Meyer said he hoped to break ground within a year, and he estimated that construction would take three and a half years. It is one of several major developments that promise to refashion the neighborhood's landscape.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''On every street and every block, there's new construction,'' said Dian Yu, the executive director of the Flushing Business Improvement District. ''It's amazing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flushing Commons is to include 235,000 square feet of small-scale retail, 185,000 square feet of office space, about 600 condos, a 62,000-square-foot Y.M.C.A., a one-and-a-half-acre park and, to make up for the lost parking lot, 1,600 underground parking spaces. The project is a joint venture with <span class="companylink">the Rockefeller Group</span> Development Corporation, which built Rockefeller Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearby, the F&amp;T Group is also building a $125 million mixed-use development that will combine a 168-room Hyatt Place hotel with three levels of retail, underground parking and a separate tower for office space and serviced apartments. Groundbreaking is this week; construction should take three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few blocks away, where Main Street ends at Northern Boulevard, the RKO Keith's Theater, designed by Thomas W. Lamb, may finally be given new life. The theater housed vaudeville acts and movies for more than half a century but has been sitting empty since the 1980s, despite the efforts of various developers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's been a cancer in downtown Flushing for over 20 years,'' said Claire Shulman, the former borough president who is now chief executive of the Flushing Willets Point Corona Local Development Corporation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year a developer, Patrick Thompson, acquired the theater by assuming a $20 million loan from <span class="companylink">Doral Bank</span>; he plans to restore the landmarked lobby while building a $160 million mixed-use development that will include 357 rental apartments, 17,460 square feet of retail, a senior center and parking. The project, Mr. Thompson's largest, has received almost all of the necessary approvals and is on track for construction to begin this year, with an opening expected in 2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Thompson said there was a strong rental market in Flushing. ''There are rental buildings in Flushing, but they're mostly older and rent-stabilized,'' he said. ''A lot of the Asian population, when they want an upscale rental, have gone to Long Island City.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Set back from the sidewalk, the apartment tower will reach 17 stories -- 175 feet -- making it higher than anything nearby. The historic lobby will be visible to passers-by through an undulating glass curtain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We want to create a new building that's reflective of the old,'' said Jay Valgora, the principal of Studio V architecture, who designed the project. ''The lobby will be on stage for all time, overlooking the community.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Promising changes are on the horizon for the Flushing waterfront as well. College Point Boulevard, which runs along the inlet of Flushing Bay, is a busy roadway that is dangerous to pedestrians and populated by construction suppliers, auto-body shops, and a large U-Haul rental and storage operation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not a traditional urban waterfront,'' said Mr. Valgora, whom the Flushing Willets Point Corona development corporation hired to draw the plans for its transformation. ''A block away you have a vibrant commercial center. They're completely cut off from their waterfront with a chain-link fence.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first step of the plan, which recently began, includes pedestrian medians as well as trees and planters to beautify College Point Boulevard and make it safer, a process that should wrap up by the end of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are turning it into a boulevard, rather than a heavily trafficked commercial street,'' Mrs. Shulman said. ''I think that will make a big difference in the appearance of the whole area, which is messy now.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The development corporation is also working to change the zoning to C4-4 from C4-2, which would call for smaller building footprints and require less parking, thereby allowing for more open space along the waterfront.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These are just the first steps. Mr. Valgora foresees 1,800 to 2,800 residences, a waterfront esplanade and boardwalk lined with cafes and restaurants, and a series of parks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We really see it as a vibrant mixture,'' he said. ''It will resemble Singapore.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Already the waterfront has one major new tenant -- perhaps the most salient evidence of Flushing's transformation up to now -- on a site that <span class="companylink">Muss Development Company</span> has owned for more than two decades. Sky View Center, an 800,000-square-foot mall a few blocks west of the Main Street station, is now 75 percent leased, and has big-box stores like Target, <span class="companylink">Bed Bath &amp; Beyond</span>, <span class="companylink">BJ's Wholesale Club</span> and <span class="companylink">Best Buy</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Queens in general is dramatically under-retailed,'' said Michael Dana, the president of Onex Real Estate Partners, which is heading development on the Sky View project. Yet, Mr. Dana added, ''the local economy in Flushing is very strong.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The demand for luxury condos has not proved quite as strong. Sky View Parc, the attached condominium towers with 448 units open and 660 planned for a second phase, is still mostly empty -- only 170 units have sold -- but Mr. Dana is confident that sales will improve when construction is complete this spring. ''I'm not the least bit disappointed,'' he said. ''We're seeing a tremendous pickup in sales.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the area is still in desperate need of affordable housing, Mrs. Shulman said. She is working on a plan to convert a municipal parking lot by the <span class="companylink">Long Island Rail Road</span> station into housing, and at the same time improve access to the train platforms, which are difficult to find and not accessible to wheelchairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Metropolitan Transportation Authority has set aside $8.5 million for wheelchair-accessible elevators; Mrs. Shulman is hoping to receive the rest of the financing (more than $30 million) from federal sources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For a major commercial area like downtown Flushing,'' the lack of wheelchair access to the railroad ''is ridiculous,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The success of most of these projects depends on large amounts of financing, which is far from certain in this economy. But the community leaders and developers say redevelopment is needed. Mr. Meyer, for one, is optimistic about the success of Flushing Commons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Flushing is a bridge between China and Korea and the United States,'' he said. ''As the economic center of gravity shifts to Asia, Flushing plays a greater role.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Specifically, he sees a great demand for commercial space. Queens Crossing, a Flushing commercial center that F&amp;T Group completed in 2008, sold out before construction began.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Yu, of the Flushing Business Improvement District, said he was happy that so much development was on the horizon but nervous about the practical effects in a neighborhood already congested with traffic. Already, he said, ''it can take you six to eight minutes for one block.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added, ''We're going to miss the parking spaces.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE housing market may be facing a prolonged dip in prices, but for real estate mutual funds the problem is very different: prices that have climbed so much that they may not be sustainable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It may seem surprising, but while home sales have slumped and foreclosure rates have risen in recent months, real estate funds, which typically invest in commercial property and multifamily housing, have boomed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 251 domestic real estate funds tracked by Lipper have returned 55.7 percent over the past two years, on average, compared with 31.2 percent for diversified equity funds. According to Morningstar, real estate funds returned 6.1 percent in the first quarter, compared with a 5.1 percent average gain for all stock funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate funds have been able to outperform the average general equity fund in part because they did so much worse in the most severe part of the downturn. During the heart of the financial crisis, some commercial real estate investments lost two-thirds of their value in less than six months. Some real estate funds ended 2008 with losses of more than 50 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's been a huge snapback from a drop that was way overdone,'' said Robert W. Gadsden, manager of the $112 million Alpine Realty Income and Growth fund, which returned 9.24 percent in the quarter, making it the top-performing real estate fund among those tracked by Lipper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate funds tend to concentrate their investments in real estate investment trusts, or REITs, which own office, industrial, apartment, health care and other types of income-producing properties. REITs were one of the hardest-hit sectors when the credit markets seized in the fall of 2008, as investors feared that they wouldn't be able to refinance their debt and that a wave of corporate bankruptcies would cause vacancy rates in their office properties to soar. From Sept. 30, 2008, to March 6, 2009, the MSCI United States REIT index plummeted 66 percent. Mr. Gadsden's Alpine Realty fund ended 2008 down 50.2 percent, according to Bloomberg.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There was extraordinary fear in the market, and people did not see the positives, like the diversification in REIT portfolios as well as their long leases and long debt agreements,'' said Mr. Gadsden, whose recent top holdings have included REITs like the <span class="companylink">Simon Property Group</span>, the mall owner, and <span class="companylink">Vornado Realty Trust</span>, the big office landlord.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As REITs began to regain access to the credit markets, however, that fear began to dissipate, prompting a relief rally that has been supported by an almost perfect mix of market conditions, fund managers say. Those conditions have included very low interest rates, depressed property prices, lots of available capital and a lack of supply of new office and apartment space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have seen occupancy rates and rental rates going up in many markets,'' said Joseph R. Betlej, co-manager of the $428 million Ivy Real Estate Securities fund. ''And that is because construction lenders turned off the spigot in 2007, and today we are faced with a lack of new supply.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ivy Real Estate Securities returned 5.7 percent in the first quarter after a 28 percent gain in 2010. Mr. Betlej's recent top holdings have included <span class="companylink">Simon Property</span>; HCP, a REIT that invests in health care properties; and <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span>, the big United States apartment owner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The perfect mix that allowed REITs to shine so brightly has prompted some analysts to warn, however, that they could now be overvalued and that investors who continue to pour money into real estate funds might wind up getting burned. After all, some analysts say, gains made when the Federal Reserve is making extraordinary efforts to keep interest rates near zero might be hard to replicate as the economy grows and inflation and interest rates start to rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors added $4.15 billion to real estate funds in the first quarter, according to EPFR Global, an analysis company based in Cambridge, Mass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I would argue that there are more risks than benefits in REITs at these prices,'' said Ryan Leggio, an analyst at Morningstar. ''If interest rates go up, they are going to be in a world of hurt.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rising rates make it more expensive for REITs to finance their property assets and to make acquisitions. With most of their income coming from longer-term leases, higher financing costs also can't be quickly passed on to tenants. REITs, by law, also must return 90 percent of their income to shareholders as dividends, making them attractive to yield-hungry investors. Higher interest rates would make other investments, like bonds and even bank certificates of deposit, more competitive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average dividend yield for REITs soared to more than 10 percent during the financial crisis, while yields of 10-year Treasury notes fell to near 2 percent. At the end of the first quarter, the dividend yield for equity REITs, which own commercial property and constitute the bulk of the market, was 3.46 percent, virtually the same as 10-year Treasuries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate fund managers acknowledge that higher interest rates could take some steam out of the commercial property market, but they say REITs will not be hurt much if any increase is modest and gradual.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If rates are rising because of inflation, real estate has historically been viewed as an inflation hedge and a store of wealth,'' said David M. Lee, manager of the $2.9 billion <span class="companylink">T. Rowe Price Real Estate</span> fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lee, whose fund gained 6 percent in the first quarter after a gain of nearly 30 percent in 2010, said REITs could keep pace if rising rates were accompanied by stronger job growth. ''We need jobs, jobs, jobs,'' he said. ''We are dealing with a physical product that needs to be filled.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One bright spot, he said, is likely to be apartment REITs, which are benefiting from strong rental demand as homeownership rates decline because of the foreclosure crisis. ''We perhaps made too much of an effort in the past to put people in homes they could not really afford,'' he said. ''As more people recognize that homeownership is not a sure thing, you will have more renters by choice.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among Mr. Lee's top holdings are two large United States apartment owners, <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span> and <span class="companylink">AvalonBay Communities</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MANAGERS say the most favorable environment for real estate funds -- and the REITs in which they invest -- would be an economy that improves enough to create more jobs but not enough to prompt major worries about inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If borrowing costs stay attractive while vacancy rates and credit ratings continue to improve -- that would be the ideal,'' said Mr. Gadsden of the Alpine Realty fund. ''The best thing for REITs going forward is a Goldilocks scenario of not too hot, not too cold.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THOUGH lovingly restored in the last eight years, Salt Meadow, the circa 1846 colonial in the tony Harriman Estates section in Sands Point, hardly compares to the newer and more ostentatious mansions nearby. Its owners, Arlene Getz and Rob Schapiro, admit that it's the runt of the block -- albeit a runt with a vineyard and 2.7 acres.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A five-bedroom five-and-a-half-bath compound, it has been listed for more than a year, first at $3.75 million and now at $2.7 million. Ms. Getz and Mr. Schapiro fear that despite its provenance as one of three houses on a former Guggenheim family estate and later part of former Gov. W. Averell Harriman's estate, the longer it sits on the market, the more likely buyers are to consider it a knockdown. Such is the fate of Land's End, a 25-room 1902 mansion just down the beach that reputedly inspired F. Scott Fitzgerald. After six years spent on the market at $30 million, it is scheduled for demolition and subdivision into five two- to four-acre lots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ms. Getz and Mr. Schapiro are trying to preserve local history. When they bought the property eight years ago it was already considered a teardown, Ms. Getz said. Pipes had burst, leaving it without heat, hot water or functioning bathrooms. Mr. Schapiro, a retired commercial pilot, spent five years renovating the post-and-beam structure, periodically unearthing fragments from its beginnings as a Quaker farmhouse, including the original kitchen hearth and marble fireplace. A midden in a massive glacial rock by the in-ground pool yielded 19th-century medicine bottles, canning lids and an old belt buckle; all are now part of a display in a miniature museum in the hallway. ''It is not just living here,'' Mr. Schapiro said, ''it is stewardship.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As an older house, he added, ''it demands attention'' and ''it's highly likely that someone with no respect for the history will just flatten this place. This is not what new wealth is looking for.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He may be fighting a losing battle. Gold Coast estates, from Great Neck to Eaton's Neck, once numbered as many as 1,400. Today there are 400 to 500, mostly built between 1890 and 1930, said Paul J. Mateyunas, the author of ''North Shore Long Island: Country Houses, 1890-1950'' (Acanthus Press, 2007) and an agent for Daniel Gale Sotheby's International Realty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some estates have been refashioned as colleges, as with the Webb Institute in Glen Cove; religious retreats, as with Inisfada in Manhasset; or catering halls, as with Oheka Castle in Huntington. Others burned down, became subdivisions or were demolished.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of those remaining, about 100 are in danger, said John Bralower, a founder of the North Shore Land Alliance, a conservation advocacy group. Two or three a year face the wrecking ball. ''They are irreplaceable gems,'' Mr. Bralower said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To save a 7,000-square-foot Greek Revival house in Oyster Bay, a two-acre property probably headed for subdivision into at least four lots, the land alliance recently snatched it up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bralower said that when the for-sale sign appeared in February he knew the property would appeal to developers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are trying to save the house, buy some time and have it restored as a single-family house or a light commercial use such as a bed-and-breakfast,'' he said. ''Old houses, depending on the condition, can be very expensive to restore. That is often an excuse to tear them down.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Kings Point an 18-room 1853 colonial overlooking Manhasset Bay that in the 1920s belonged to the writer Ring Lardner has been on the market for three and a half years, reduced to $1.448 million from $3.3 million. Fitzgerald, a friend of Lardner's, is said to have sat on the porch gazing across the water at parties in progress. The Lardner-Fitzgerald friendship was detailed in the 1976 Ring Lardner Jr. memoir ''The Lardners: My Family Remembered.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A current owner, Susan Ruggiero, 43, who grew up in the house, acknowledged that the kitchen and baths needed updating but called the literary heritage ''very special'' and said, ''It was always assumed that his being at our home helped to inspire'' Fitzgerald to write ''The Great Gatsby.'' With the price more than halved, and some of the water view blocked by a new modern mansion, she fears for the house's survival. ''I hope we find someone who falls in love with it and its history and preserves it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alexandra Wolfe, an official with the Society for the Preservation of Long Island Antiquities, an advocacy group, said preservationists were not ''winning the argument'' over those ''driven by the need to have something shiny and new.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There will always be a population of people who can afford to build gigantic new houses,'' Ms. Wolfe said, ''and they don't see the value of an historic home with a sense of place, a sense of character.'' In many villages, she said, there are no landmark laws and ''no mechanism to protect'' historic structures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet some outcomes have been different. Last month in Old Westbury an elegantly restored 20,000-square-foot Georgian-style mansion, built in 1925 and once owned by Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, who founded the Whitney Museum of American Art, sold for $15.88 million -- and it hadn't even been listed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael J. Berman, the listing agent for the 9.2-acre property, had a client whose bid for a nearby $12.9 million mansion was turned down. Mr. Berman, the president of Automatic Real Estate Associates, decided ''to be creative'' and approached the owner of the Whitney estate to ''try to pull the rabbit out of my hat.'' And his scheme worked.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The men who operate and maintain cranes and other heavy equipment are the royalty of the construction industry, with some earning well over $200,000 a year in jobs often passed down from fathers to sons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now powerful elements of New York City's real estate industry are trying to enlist City Hall in a looming contract battle with their union, whose conduct is governed by an accumulation of traditions, work rules and contract terms dating 100 years to the days of steam shovels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city is considering a request by developers and contractors to require crane operators to carry a national license, rather than a city one, which is likely to antagonize the union because it could put people from outside New York, and outside the union, into the cabs of cranes. The real estate executives and Deputy Mayor Stephen Goldsmith say the move would make job sites safer. But the executives are not denying that the threat of a new licensing requirement could help them achieve another goal: eliminating a small but expensive class of workers in the union -- master mechanics and oilers -- whose jobs, they say, were long ago rendered obsolete by technological advances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm hoping this will lead to real negotiations,'' said Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York, the powerful lobbying organization. ''If it's nonproductive work, why are we paying for it?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The struggle provides a glimpse into the arcane world of high-rise construction, and an industry desperate to cut costs and increase profits in an unforgiving economy. It also puts the city in a tenuous position of being perceived as a tool for pressuring a union.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leaders of the union, Locals 14 and 15 of the International Union of Operating Engineers, who represent about 6,500 workers, did not return calls requesting comment. But they are clearly wary of being depicted as the poster boys for padded contracts: after refusing to make concessions, as other unions have done in recent years, they are negotiating with the <span class="companylink">Port Authority of New York and New Jersey</span> to reduce by two-thirds the number of master mechanics required on the construction of three skyscrapers, the transit hub, the national memorial and the vehicle screening center at ground zero.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The union dates to the 1890s, when an ancestor, the National Union of Steam Engineers, was organized to represent the men who operated and repaired the often dangerous steam boilers found in factories and office buildings, and on construction sites. The operating engineers are an insular group, still largely Irish-American and Italian-American, with jobs passed from father to son, a relative or a friend. They have been far slower than electricians and carpenters at integrating their ranks with blacks, Hispanics and women.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leaders of the two locals also have a long and tangled relationship with organized crime figures. Two federal racketeering prosecutions in 2003 resulted in prison terms for most of the leadership and led to the appointment of a corruption monitor, George Stamboulidis, in 2009, to oversee Local 14. His actions have led to the expulsion of two members and he has moved against several others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The developers and union contractors want to eliminate the requirement for one master mechanic on construction sites where four or more operating engineers work. The mechanics earn $65 an hour (crane operators earn $64), with another $30 an hour in benefits, to be on site to repair cranes; they get double wages after eight hours and on Saturdays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the tower cranes are not owned by the contractor the engineers work for. They are rented from crane companies, which usually prohibit anyone but their own engineers from fixing the equipment, leaving the contractor's engineers with relatively little to do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The contractors also want to do away with ''relief crane operators,'' a second operator required to stand by for every crane on buildings constructed of concrete, rather than steel, as well as ''oilers,'' whose only task is to fire up the crane every morning, which, contractors say, takes less than an hour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The oiler and the relief operator jobs are vestiges of when the equipment required a higher degree of maintenance and the act of operating a steam crane was more physically demanding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They've become what we know in the industry as glorified timekeepers,'' said one veteran crane operator, who declined to be identified so as not to anger members of his union, especially the master mechanics and oilers. Still, he said, it would be foolish to assume that getting rid of those jobs would make buildings significantly cheaper through labor savings. ''They're going to put it in their pocket,'' he said of contractors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a meeting last month, Stephen M. Ross of Related Companies and other members of the Real Estate Board pressed Mr. Goldsmith to adopt a national licensing requirement for tower crane operators and to do away with the city license that they must now carry. That could open the ranks of crane operators to more people, and it could also weaken the union's grip on the licensing process. City licenses require three years' experience working under a city-licensed crane operator, virtually all of whom belong to the union.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Goldsmith said the city favored national licensing out of a concern for safety, a critical concern after nine people died in two crane accidents in 2008. National standards, he said, tend to evolve more quickly with changes in technology. He said the Bloomberg administration would be talking to contractors, the City Council and union officials over the next couple of weeks about how to make it happen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jessica Lappin, the city councilwoman from the Upper East Side, where both crane collapses occurred, said the issue was not so simple. ''I don't want someone from Kansas coming here with a national certificate and operating a crane on 51st Street,'' she said, referring to the site of one of the accidents. ''We want to make sure our licensing regs are specific to New York,'' a very dense urban environment with little room for mistakes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Goldsmith said the city would consider adding provisions that would require nationally licensed operators to receive training in an urban setting before being allowed to run a crane in the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real estate board also unveiled an 11-page PowerPoint presentation at City Hall claiming that doing away with 56 ''non-working'' mechanics and oilers at the World Trade Center site could save $67 million over the next three years. The analysis assumed that the mechanics cost their employers as much as $700,000 apiece in wages, benefits and taxes, working 15 hours a day, six days a week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One real estate executive conceded that there were ''unnecessary exaggerations'' in the numbers. He put the potential annual cost of a master mechanic at $400,000, a figure that some in the industry still view with incredulity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the operating engineers are unlikely to get much sympathy from their fellow construction workers. Over the last three years, union plumbers, iron workers, carpenters and electricians have made concessions to their employers, but the relatively smaller group of operating engineers' locals have not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A few years ago, I might've gone with these guys,'' Robert Walsh, business manager of Iron Workers Local 40, said. ''But those guys don't want to work with anybody else. They don't get it. Something has to be done.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: April 14, 2011, Thursday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Saturday about a looming fight between the New York real estate industry and the crane operators' union misspelled the surname of a corruption monitor who was appointed after federal racketeering prosecutions of two union locals. He is George Stamboulidis, not Stambolidis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An earlier version of this article also described the role of the corruption monitor, George Stamboulidis, imprecisely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: April 24, 2011, Sunday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on April 9 about coming contract negotiations between developers and the International Union of Operating Engineers in New York misidentified the jurisdiction of a corruption monitor appointed after federal racketeering prosecutions in 2003 resulted in prison terms for most of the union leadership. The monitor oversees only Local 14, not Local 14 and Local 15.</p>

</div><div class="author">By ANDREW MARTIN </div><div>1651 words</div><div>8 April 2011</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NORTH PORT, Fla. -- One recent morning, Shannon Moore raced through a musty pink house -- three bedrooms, two baths -- that was advertised as having ''good bones'' and ''primed for renovation.'' As in many recently foreclosed homes in Florida, the appliances and air-conditioner were missing from this one, either taken by the previous residents or stolen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not as bad as I thought,'' Ms. Moore said. ''You could probably get this place fixed up for $8,000. You could get a refrigerator on <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span> for $200.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''$70,000?'' she asks aloud, referring to the list price. ''What the heck?'' Ms. Moore, a real estate broker, has found a profitable niche in the wreckage of Florida's real estate market, where a glut of vacant homes continues to depress prices. She scouts out deals for several groups of investors, including one that counts a professional poker player as a member and a group of Macedonians from Toronto.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just a few years back, real estate investors were considered pariahs for fomenting a buying frenzy that drove home prices to stratospheric levels. This time around, housing experts say investors are desperately needed because there are so many vacant homes and homebuyers are having such trouble obtaining credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If Florida is going to have a comeback anytime soon, investors are going to have to play a role,'' said Rick Sharga, a senior vice president at RealtyTrac. ''There are just too many properties for traditional home buyers to absorb.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, speculators have been picking through the rubble of America's real estate collapse for several years now, and the housing industry remains deeply troubled across the country, suggesting that it would be far worse were it not for investors. Data released by the National Association of Realtors recently shows that investors represented 17 percent of all home sales in 2010 nationwide, the same as the previous year. But in recent months, investment activity has picked up, according to Walter Molony, an association spokesman, who attributed the increase to relatively cheap prices and the lack of available credit for homebuyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no shortage of deals in Florida. The Census Bureau recently reported that 17 percent of the homes in Florida were vacant. Even though the figure includes vacation homes that were unoccupied at the time of the survey, the underlying rate within the state reflects a sustained downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median house price in Florida, meanwhile, had dropped to $121,900 in February, from $257,800 in June 2006, a decline of 53 percent, according to Metrostudy, a housing research firm. Indeed, some houses and condominiums in Florida are selling for roughly the price of a practical family sedan, new or used.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, a two-bedroom house in Port Charlotte, just south of North Port on the gulf coast of the state, recently sold for $8,000, and listings for $25,000 homes are not uncommon. Many experts expect prices to drop even further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Nationally we are expecting prices to stabilize by the end of this year,'' said Celia Chen, senior director at <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics. ''We don't expect it to stabilize in Florida until sometime in 2012, and that's a direct overhang of the excess inventory.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the risks, several investors expressed optimism about their chances of making money, if not a killing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A wise man told me that the best time to enter a business is during a recession,'' said Peter Ide, a British builder who was transferred by his company to Florida to buy up homes, fix them up and resell them. ''The potential here is phenomenal.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steve Barnhardt, a friend of Ms. Moore's, said he began buying up houses to stay afloat until the market revived. On this morning, he was installing inexpensive carpet in a three-bedroom house that he purchased for $76,000 and had just sold for $103,000; he estimates his profit was $9,000 after paying $5,000 in back taxes and closing costs. (He says he could have made more if not for ''low-life'' neighbors.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The things I used to do are no longer out there,'' said Mr. Barnhardt, who had previously made a comfortable living investing in commercial real estate and operating heavy equipment. ''Right now, this is what is paying my property taxes and keeping me alive.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not everyone views real estate investors as that benign, or savvy. April Charney, a public aid lawyer who lives in nearby Venice, questioned why investors would fix up houses with so few eligible buyers. Besides, she said the new owners were likely to end up with a vacant home next door with squatters, mold or filthy pools.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They are dreaming,'' she said. ''That's just a pipe dream in North Port.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for investors, there is the occasional reminder that they are benefitting from the misfortunes of others. A few weeks ago, a painter found a letter addressed to ''the next occupant of this fine home'' in one of the houses Ms. Moore's investors had purchased.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This house was my dream but like life sometimes dreams don't work out,'' the letter read. ''Now I'm just surrounded with boxes of memories and dashed intentions of what may have been. So do me a favor. Make your own good memories here.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 35 miles southeast of Sarasota, North Port was carved out of shrub land in the 1950s by the General Development Corporation, which sold the plots to buyers up north. It remained a relatively quiet community until the last decade, when developers erected one subdivision after the next.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">North Port's population doubled in less than four years, city officials say. There are now about 55,000 residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In those high-flying days of Florida real estate, Ms. Moore said she would buy up vacant shrub land and sell seven or eight lots on a good day, for $50,000 apiece, making as much as 40 percent in profits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those days are long gone, and North Port has fallen hard. Ms. Moore, a Florida native, is stuck with four plots that cost her $38,000 each (each is worth $5,000 or less) and a duplex she bought for $140,000 (it's now worth $30,000, she says).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She is also $100,000 under water on her house and living on a street, Mistleto Lane, in which a third of the houses are vacant, including one just across the street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, Ms. Moore reinvented herself as an intelligence agent of sorts, alerting her clients, for instance, to details like whether a house has undesirable neighbors, Chinese drywall or an unsavory past. (She steered her clients away from a three-bedroom house that appeared to be a steal, but was tied to a grisly rape and murder.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One investor, a Florida businessman, exclusively buys duplexes. Ms. Moore's Macedonian clients want three-bedroom, two-bathroom houses that cost about $100,000, which they buy and rent. Mr. Ide's group, which includes a retired Maryland developer and the poker player, buys homes at foreclosure auctions, fixes them up and resells them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since investors can't inspect the inside of a foreclosed house before auction, Mr. Ide's group is particularly reliant on Ms. Moore's local knowledge. If she isn't familiar with a house, she drives by and often brings along two of her three daughters, who are home-schooled. (Her 13-year-old, Willow, has made as much as $400 a week on <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span>, selling belongings left behind in vacant homes.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During a recent auction, Ms. Moore sat in front of a computer screen in her office, with Mr. Ide's partner, Jon Breen, the retired developer, on the speaker phone. Thirteen properties were being auctioned by the county this morning, though Mr. Breen focused his attention on a half dozen or so.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Moore pulled up comparable sales and back taxes, while Mr. Breen calculated his costs aloud.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Barcelona has $8,367 in back taxes,'' she says, referring to a house on Barcelona Avenue in Sarasota. ''Remember the house next door had an odd color.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think it's a junky piece of property,'' Mr. Breen said, before bidding $59,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later, when the house sells for $64,001, she says, ''Who is the dummy today? They are paying way too much.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Breen ended up buying two houses in North Port, one for $111,001 and another for $77,002.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Later that day, when Ms. Moore met the investors to change the locks and inspect the houses, they were pleasantly surprised. Both houses were in relatively good condition and would require only some paint and minor repairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is about as good as it gets,'' Mr. Ide said, as he inspected the $111,001 house, a four-bedroom where some water damage around the Jacuzzi was the only apparent problem. But it did get better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A week later, after $4,500 was spent on new appliances and repairs, an offer was made on the house for $152,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Moore, meanwhile, has plowed her earnings into her own deals, recently purchasing a second duplex for $30,000 in cash. ''I'm getting $650 a side in rent, a lot better than the stock market,'' she said. ''My plan is to buy up as much multifamily as I can while the market is down.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QUINCY, Mass. -- Barring a catastrophe, few cities get the chance to totally rebuild their downtowns, from the sewer lines deep underground to the sidewalks, buildings, parks and lighting above. But an unusual public-private partnership is allowing this city of 91,000, first settled in the early 17th century and famed as the hometown of the Adams presidents, to try to do just that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city has approved plans to raze most of its 50-acre center and replace it with $289 million in new infrastructure and $1.3 billion of new private housing, retail, offices, entertainment, hotels and parking. The private builder, Street-Works Development of White Plains, will pay for the public improvements upfront.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once Street-Works installs the utilities, roadways, parking and landscaping; builds a number of new buildings and leases 50 to 75 percent of the space, the city will assume responsibility for the infrastructure bill by selling general obligations bonds. Some income from the property will flow to the city to cover interest on the debt, amortize the principal and generate extra money for city coffers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We couldn't afford to do this on our own, this quickly,'' Mayor Thomas P. Koch said. But after 30 years of wanting to revitalize a downtown drained of businesses, shopping and housing by outlying neighborhoods, he said, ''we've established a relationship of trust with Street-Works.'' In 2005 the developer started planning what is to be called New Quincy Center. In January it signed a master agreement with the city to codify the plan and set milestones it must meet before Quincy floats the bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a reversal of the traditional urban development model, in which municipalities pay for public improvements before the private sector starts construction. And it could be a template in an era when state and federal agencies are retreating from ambitious redevelopment projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the 21st century, innovative mayors will have to redefine development rules, and it's commendable that this mayor is willing to take the risk,'' said Thomas Murphy, a senior fellow at the Urban Land Institute and a former mayor of Pittsburgh. ''If Quincy succeeds, it's a game changer.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the consequences of failure can be significant. In downtown Boston, for instance, there is a gaping block-size hole where <span class="companylink">Vornado Realty Trust</span> and <span class="companylink">Gale International</span> halted construction of a large mixed-use project, One Franklin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The bigger projects are, the more difficult and fragile they are,'' said George J. Fantini Jr., the chairman of Fantini &amp; Gorga, a commercial real estate mortgage broker based in Boston. ''For a project to succeed, each building has to be feasible in its own right.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ken Narva, a partner in Street-Works, said the risk in Quincy was minimized by the city's easy access to mass transit, the broad scope of the project, a strong local economy and the lack of a vital urban center elsewhere on the South Shore. ''We're building a new neighborhood, not a project,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan is to build, in increments, 3.5 million square feet of new space: 1,200 rental and condominium apartments, 625,000 square feet of retail, two hotels and entertainment; 1.5 million square feet of offices for higher education, health care, professionals and businesses; and parking for 5,500 vehicles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ten years of construction will start mid-2012, first on the infrastructure and then in mid-2013 on the buildings. The first group of buildings, 1.3 million square feet valued at about $700 million, will include approximately 300 apartments, 325,000 square feet for retailers, 350,000 square feet of offices, a hotel and parking for about 2,000 cars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before construction starts, Street-Works estimates it will have spent $50 million of its own funds, as well as money raised from Quincy Mutual Fire Insurance Company, Ronus Properties of Atlanta and others. For construction financing the developer plans to take the city bond guarantee and its signed leases to the private equity and debt markets for institutional and traditional loans, Mr. Narva said. He and his partner, Richard Heapes, are talking to potential joint venture partners to develop at least 12 of the 25 new buildings with financing they raise themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The underlying premise is that Quincy is a great location,'' Mr. Narva said. ''Its mass transit is a main driver of value creation.'' Quincy Center has a Red Line subway stop, six stops from downtown Boston and 10 from Cambridge. The city is on a main highway, Interstate 93, and has 27 miles of waterfront. ''The developer is here because of the T stop,'' said Mayor Koch, referring to the transit system, who said he was impressed when he visited Street-Works' Blue Back Square project in West Hartford, Conn. He said he hoped to secure another $50 million in state and federal grants for infrastructure work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Quincy Center will offer what many empty nesters and young workers say they prefer: a walkable, urban place to live, work and play. But this type of overhaul would not succeed everywhere, said Gregory Bialecki, the state secretary of housing and economic development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It may work here because Quincy is willing to make a big financial commitment; the developer has a long-term plan with the flexibility to survive a few market cycles; and since the fall of 2009 the regional South Shore economy has performed well, creating jobs in sectors that are driving the overall state economy like health care, higher education and financial services. Further, Mr. Bialecki said, ''that everyone has skin in the game from the start is a strong sign it will work.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether it does, ''rests on how much space Quincy can absorb'' said Gleb Nechayev, an economist with CBRE Econometric Advisors. Because Quincy added 6.8 percent more housing units and 4.8 percent more residents from 2000 to 2010, he said, ''the project has a good chance of success.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By mid-2013, the Quincy region is expected to return to peak employment, with the jobless rate dipping below 7 percent for the first time since early 2009, said Michael Lynch, an economist at IHS Global Insight. ''By the time buildings come online, the economy will be in much better shape to handle them,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By early next year Street-Works hopes to have letters of intent for a cinema; at least 300,000 square feet of offices for education, health care and businesses; and 100,000 square feet of large format retailing, Mr. Narva said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the plan fails, Mayor Koch said, ''the city walks away with more than it had five years ago.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If it succeeds, Mr. Narva said, ''we'll feel good about creating a great urban place and make a lot of money.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN late June 2008, a week after he astonished the golf world by winning the United States Open while grimacing in pain on a torn left knee, Tiger Woods traveled to a craggy chunk of land on the Baja Peninsula in Mexico. It was a lunarlike landscape of dirt and rock, with an inactive volcano in the background. For several hours, he hobbled over the terrain, discussing with developers his vision for the golf course he would build there, while waves from the Pacific crashed onto the shoreline below. His knee, said one companion, rattled like tools in a tool box.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Woods would soon undergo surgery that would shut down his season, but no matter: the Tiger legend was steaming ahead, and the fall from grace that would follow was unthinkable then. His heroic performance in the Open had enhanced his stature as perhaps the greatest player ever. It was his 14th major championship, putting him only four behind Jack Nicklaus's 18, the singular goal that Mr. Woods had been pursuing since he turned pro in 1996. His earnings from golf and endorsements had made him wealthy beyond imagination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now he was turning his attention to a new challenge, his course design business, one that would extend his brand, bring him untold more millions and leave his permanent imprint on the game he seemed to have mastered so easily.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Baja course, called Punta Brava, was Mr. Woods's third design. With its breathtaking landscape, it was easy to envision it rivaling Pebble Beach and establishing his legacy as an architect at age 32. At the news conference to unveil the course, in October 2008 at the Hotel Bel Air in Beverly Hills, he looked at ease sitting next to Red McCombs, the billionaire co-founder of <span class="companylink">Clear Channel Communications</span>, who was one of the investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I can't wait until we actually start construction, and we get to move some dirt because that's when I can really get my hands on it and really be out there even more than I am now,'' Mr. Woods said at the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, two and a half years later, no dirt has been moved at Punta Brava and Mr. Woods has not visited in some time. His two other designs, in Dubai and near Asheville, N.C., are also troubled; the Dubai course, according to people familiar with the project, has been shelved permanently. The desert sands have started to reclaim the strips of green from the six holes that have been completed. The Asheville project is searching for new financing, and construction has halted until at least this summer. In the nearly five years since Tiger Woods Design was founded, none of the courses have been completed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a trajectory that mirrors just about every element of Mr. Woods's life these days: As he enters the Masters tournament beginning on Thursday, his golf game has fallen apart and he is overhauling his swing for the fourth time in his career. The string of affairs that made him tabloid fodder in 2009 and 2010 cost him his marriage, custody of his two young children and the loss of endorsement deals with <span class="companylink">Accenture</span>, <span class="companylink">AT&amp;T</span> and Gatorade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brian Tucker, the founder and developer of Punta Brava, said the delay there had nothing to do with Mr. Woods's personal scandal. His group had to redo the environmental impact study, he said, and groundbreaking is set for later this year. What remains to be seen is how much the developers will use Mr. Woods's image to sell the course. Mr. Tucker suggested that Punta Brava would be marketed mostly on its exotic locale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This project is not about Tiger Woods,'' Mr. Tucker said last month, emphasizing that the course is surrounded on three sides by the ocean and has 12 holes requiring a player to hit the ball over water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Punta Brava's location allows it to play down Mr. Woods's involvement, but the two other courses he designed do not have this luxury. His allure as one of the world's great champions was a crucial pillar of the sales plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bryon Bell, president of Tiger Wood Design, said the firm would not be looking for new partners in Dubai. ''As the course designer, it is not our role to secure financing for the projects,'' he wrote in an e-mail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When asked about the Asheville project, he said: ''Our role beyond design work can vary depending on the client. Some request additional promotional or marketing opportunities, others just ask for our patience during these economic times.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, the only golf project that Tiger Woods Design has completed is behind Mr. Woods's newly finished mansion on Jupiter Island, Fla. With four greens, seven sand traps and different cuts of grass, the 3.5-acre pitch-and-putt course would delight any golfer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Mr. Woods could surprise the golf world and win this week at the Masters, it will take more than a major championship to rehabilitate his business career. And that raises some questions: What will become of the two remaining courses that bear his name, and can Tiger Woods Design re-emerge as a viable enterprise?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHEN Tiger Woods started his golf design business in 2006, few doubted that he could deliver a course that everyone would want to play. That confidence didn't vanish when the global economy began to fracture in 2008. Real estate values -- so vital to any golf development -- were dropping but were not yet considered at crisis levels. There were signs of a financial reckoning on the horizon, but not in the world inhabited by millionaire investors looking for a spot in golf's most exclusive clubs. The Tiger market remained bullish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors had compelling reasons to hope that Mr. Woods was recession-proof. Dubai had ponied up an estimated $55 million, according to widely circulated reports, for the privilege of owning Mr. Woods's first-ever course design. The Asheville project, at a gated community called the Cliffs at High Carolina, had reportedly paid him $10 million. The usual fee for course design by a top architect runs $2 million to $3 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It didn't matter that Mr. Woods had never designed a course. Who more than Tiger Woods knew his way around bentgrass and bunkers? With his practical experience, he would learn the details of the business on the job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so he set about to do so. ''The amount of meetings I've been in -- people would be shocked,'' he said in an interview in 2008. ''But that's how you gain experience, how you can gain knowledge, being in meetings and participating. You learn and grow.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the beginning, Mr. Woods was hands-on. To the delight of his backers, he visited the sites often. He reworked the layout of the courses until they met his standards. At Punta Brava, he made 27 routing maps, when most top architects do three or four. At High Carolina, he changed the layout so that that the ninth hole would not be northern-facing and unplayable in the winter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also made time for the publicity events that were part of the deal. He traveled to Dubai in December 2006 to announce that his first course design would be built in the desert, surrounded by mansions costing tens of millions of dollars. In 2007, he strolled into a packed room at one of the Cliffs' other communities, in South Carolina, to unveil his plans for High Carolina, his first course in the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year later, after his victory at Torrey Pines, he made his trip to Punta Brava to approve the final layout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Actions like this only burnished his image with investors: he was a great golfer, and also a man of his word. What was selling these projects, of course, was Tiger Woods the champion, not Tiger Woods the course designer. Jack Nicklaus, who has operated a successful design business since 1969, was one of the few who added a sobering voice when asked about Mr. Woods's precociousness in course design: ''Yes, but he hasn't done any yet,'' Mr. Nicklaus said soon after the Cliffs broke ground. ''He's on his third golf-course contract.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His comment proved prescient, though no one wanted to hear it any more than they wanted to hear that housing prices wouldn't always go up. Mr. Woods's aura was evident at the gala in Beverly Hills that officially announced Punta Brava. In a scene more like a film premiere, Mr. Woods met with hundreds of the world's wealthiest golfers, many of whom had made their money through shrewd business dealings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I introduced him to every single person that night, 250 people,'' said Brady Oman, who was then part of the development group but has since left. ''It went past midnight. He stayed way past the end.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prospect of working with Mr. Woods caused even the savviest among them to drop their normal skepticism. At the unveiling of the project in 2008, Red McCombs, the major financial backer of Punta Brava, said that initially, ''I wasn't turned on by the whole thing. Then they said, 'I think we can get Tiger involved in designing this.' I said, 'Forget it, it's over, I'm in.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McCombs, a lifelong real estate investor, added: ''It was the idea of Tiger coming in as a partner and designing the course, not just in name but in total involvement in the course. He has such an impeccable background and he added to the property.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, two and a half years later, with the business seemingly stymied, it is hard to sort out all the contributing factors. The economic crisis was certainly one of them. Credit dried up, and real estate prices plunged. It was a bad time for any development, and the golf industry suffered. According to the National Golf Foundation, only 46 new courses opened in the United States in 2010, the fewest in 25 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is evidence, too, that all three developments significantly overestimated the prices they could charge for surrounding real estate, with lavish mansions in Dubai and homes at Punta Brava priced as high as $12 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tarnishing of Mr. Woods's image has presumably hurt as well. Its impact is harder to quantify, though it probably has been more of a factor for the Cliffs, which based its initial sales pitch as much on Mr. Woods's personality and reputation as on his athletic accomplishments. Jim Anthony, the project's founder, does not even play golf. He likes to fish and take long walks with his pedometer ticking off the miles. His vision of the Cliffs was to sell the communities based on a lifestyle of health and wellness and a family-friendly image.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So when the string of affairs that ended Mr. Woods's marriage was revealed, the Cliffs had to scramble; now, the marketing is affected by the fact that the company doesn't want to plaster Mr. Woods's image over all of its promotional materials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Anthony said he harbored no animosity toward Mr. Woods. ''I don't know of any of us who hasn't made a mistake,'' he said. ''I had some conversations with Tiger when he was here. I think he's genuinely working hard.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he does not blame Mr. Woods's travails for the sluggish sales at High Carolina. ''I think it's very minimally Tiger,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regardless, Mr. Woods's work with these projects is largely done. He has been paid the bulk of his contract fees. ''Traditionally, a course designer's job begins and ends with designing a great course,'' said Mr. Bell, the head of the company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, there have not been any new projects announced by Tiger Woods Design. ''We are evaluating opportunities from all over the world,'' Mr. Bell said. ''We're staying focused on our original mission of finding great sites, great partners, and creating spectacular designs. I'm very confident about our future.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FOR the investors who backed Tiger Woods's designs, time is running short, or has run out altogether. The Dubai project appears all but dead. Mr. Woods's Web site says completion of the course is pending and that he might revive it. But an official at Golf in Dubai, which promotes the sport in the emirate said the project was ''as good as dead and buried.'' He said the chief executive had left and that the second in command was back in Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Basically it was an exorbitant project,'' said the official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to avoid contradicting his organization's role. ''The $100 million mansions were too expensive even during the years of real estate boom in Dubai.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Punta Brava, the hardest-to-reach of Mr. Woods's courses, is the one in the best financial position. It, too, started with grand plans of 8,000-square-foot mansions and a gigantic clubhouse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as the economy cratered, the developers found themselves battling local groups over the environmental impact study it had submitted. Even after they redid the study, they faced hurdles to getting the proper permits to build along the Pacific.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Tucker, the founder, said this delay, however frustrating, turned out to be a blessing. He was able to go back to prospective buyers who had toured the site and ask if they were still interested.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We said, 'Let's talk about prices.' Before, we were looking at the $3 million-$12 million ranges; now based on all of this we're looking at $800,000 to $3.9 million,'' he said. ''We took advantage of a difficult, stressful, frustrating situation that allowed us to refine the land plan for Punta Brava and give not what the market wants but what our people want.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project has also benefited from financial backing from Mr. McCombs and Ruben Gonzalez Pena, a businessman in the Baja area, so it has not had to rely on bank financing. They have also appealed to a crowd of wealthy golf purists who have access to the private jets they will need to land at the local airport. (The club provides members helicopter transportation from the airport to their homes -- that is, if they don't have their own helicopter.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AS for the Cliffs, it seems to be caught between success and failure. It seemed to be the safest choice -- a string of seven golf communities with a proven record of success. But its ability to pay for the course, and its constant operation, was contingent on the ability to sell homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the groundbreaking in November 2008, with Mr. Woods attending in specially designed <span class="companylink">Nike</span> clothing, the Cliffs said that it had sold 40 lots at High Carolina, starting at $500,000. That number has not changed since then.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After struggling through 2009, the Cliffs realized that it needed financial help. It borrowed $64 million from a group of residents in April 2010, and, in January this year, a Dallas-based property developer made an investment to help restructure its debt. Mr. Anthony said that this helped reduce the debt burden by $50 million, and that he continues to work with other lenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We make no bones about it: cash flow is still tough,'' he said. ''We feel fortunate that our property owners are supporting us.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don Tucker, a lawyer who serves on the advisory board for the group that lent the club $64 million, said his group had recommended that work be halted on the Tiger Woods course -- and that other improvements at the Cliffs be postponed -- so it could first finish the development's seventh course, one designed by Gary Player.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this has created a chicken-or-egg scenario: Mr. Woods's course can't be completed until more homes are sold, but buyers won't commit until the course is finished.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's the conundrum for every golf course designer,'' Mr. Tucker said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Anthony, who began his career as a telephone lineman, remains optimistic. He noted that <span class="companylink">Southwest Airlines</span> is going to start flying into Asheville, which he hopes will help with sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many ways, living on a Tiger Woods course was always based more on allure than financial calculation -- the seductive combination of natural beauty, exclusivity and Mr. Woods's platinum image. ''I want to get to know them, and they should get to know me,'' Mr. Woods said in the 2008 interview, of the people he would work with. ''It's not just going out there and designing golf courses. I consider it a partnership. We're in this together through thick and thin.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Mr. Woods's early forays into course design have stumbled -- and have definitely come at great cost to the projects' financial backers -- no one is accusing him of doing his job poorly or failing to keep his commitments. Like his golf game, the business is simply stuck, beyond even his power to lift it up, bend it to his will and defy natural forces the way so many of his superhuman golf shots did when he sent them soaring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, it seems likely that Mr. Woods will get the opportunity to build other courses in the future. At some point, his personal scandal will have faded, the real estate market may pick up and he could even start winning golf tournaments again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until then, Mr. Woods at least has the practice course in his backyard. That is more than his partners can say.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ON a recent Sunday afternoon, as filmgoers at the AMC Loews Lincoln Center settled in with their tubs of popcorn and vats of soda to see the new thriller ''Limitless,'' what seemed like a traditional movie trailer began.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between the sweeping shots of Manhattan fast-paced cuts showed glimpses of city landmarks, bustling streets, crowded subways and strollers ambling over the Brooklyn Bridge. As the pulse of the music intensified, New York was depicted in constant motion, with clouds racing above the soaring towers, and with one newcomer to the skyline -- its undulating steel skin glistening gold in the sunshine -- playing a starring role.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the trailer ended, four simple words flashed onto the screen: ''New York by Gehry.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was not a teaser for the newest Hollywood blockbuster. The pitch was for the latest addition to the luxury high-rise rental market in the city, a 76-story tower designed by Frank Gehry at 8 Spruce Street, on the edge of the financial district.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The feature film that followed, ''Limitless,'' explores what happens when someone taps the full potential of his brain. The Gehry building -- along with a dozen other new large-scale luxury rental buildings that have gone on the market in the last year -- is testing the limits of the price renters will pay for what developers call ''aspirational living.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in a city not known for restraint when it comes to displays of wealth and status the properties -- with their tens of thousands of square feet dedicated to amenities like private screening rooms, sprawling gyms and even a dog spa -- are something new in the rental market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decision by developers to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on rental projects that in past years would most likely have been high-end condos was driven by a number of factors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the boom years, developers say, the market was oversaturated with new luxury condo construction. At the same time, and even in the worst period of the recession, rental vacancy rates in Manhattan remained low, never creeping above 3 percent. As lending tightened banks leery of new home construction were more willing to finance rental projects. Then, even that financing dried up. As a result the new mega-rental complexes have the field to themselves, at least for the time being, as few similarly ambitious projects are on the horizon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More fundamentally people are questioning whether it makes more sense to buy or rent a home in what remains a fragile and often confounding market. Developers are betting that at least for now even those with the money to buy may choose to hang on the sidelines and rent, even if it costs them some very big dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices at many of these new luxury rental buildings start as much as 20 percent higher than similar properties already on the market. At the Beatrice in Midtown, for instance, the starting price for studios is more than $3,000 a month; one-bedrooms start at $4,500; and the four penthouses $20,000 per month. Those prices are similar to 8 Spruce Street, where rents start at $2,630 a month for studios and top out at $25,000 a month for three-bedroom penthouses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MaryAnne Gilmartin, an executive vice president of Forest City Ratner, which developed the Gehry building, said that when the project was taking shape in 2007 including 200 condo units on the top floors was ''seriously contemplated.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It seemed worth studying because you could create something very special,'' Ms. Gilmartin said. But it was the height of the condo craze, before the bust. ''We saw the potential oversupply of condos and we were taken aback by it,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forest City Ratner had wiggle room, because it had bought the land in 2004, when land prices were less expensive. By 2007 land prices were so high that most developers thought they could make money only by building condos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We believed there would not be a tremendous number of new rentals,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decision to make the entire building rental, with 901 apartments, now seems prescient. But in the end it will all come down to whether the apartments at 8 Spruce Street are priced correctly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Gilmartin said that she believed that upscale rental properties appealed to ''a generation of young people who don't have the same interest in buying,'' and people living an ''untethered'' lifestyle. There are also those who might have trouble securing a mortgage and older people looking to downscale, she said, echoing other developers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a time when potential buyers are still worried about the future of the real estate market, developers believe the best way to win tenants in a competitive environment is to offer renters the perks that once came only with upscale condo complexes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest entry into the field is MiMA, a 63-story glass tower on 42nd Street between 9th and 10th Avenues in Midtown Manhattan that started offering rental leases on its 500 apartments last month. Among its list of attractions are exclusive access to the M Club, ''a 44,000-square-foot hand-crafted amenity space that caters to and enhances the daily lives of residents.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even its arty-sounding name is a measure of its ambition. MiMA, an abbreviation for middle of Manhattan, is an attempt to rechristen a neighborhood long known as plain old Midtown West or, more ominously, Hell's Kitchen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While offering ample room for luxuries like a full-size basketball court and a residents-only Equinox gym, Gregory H. Gushee, a senior vice president of Related, the project's developer, said the units were configured in such a way as to get 500 rentals where plans had initially called for 460. Even though rents start at $3,300 for a small studio, Mr. Gushee said that he was confident that the top-tier service would justify top-tier prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think there will be a few years of rents just going up because there is nothing being built,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Renters may be paying more, but they aren't getting more space in many of the new buildings. Developers say that renters do not make the same price-per-square-foot calculation as buyers, and that smaller apartments -- with some studios less than 500 square feet and larger one-bedrooms barely topping 1,000 square feet -- will not discourage the target audience. And while computer-assisted layouts have often been employed to make the most efficient use of every inch of space, these buildings frequently provide rooms for giving parties, screening movies and entertaining guests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MiMA, where renters will start moving in April 15, joins buildings including the 60-story Silver Towers at 610-620 42nd Street with 1,276 rental units; the 52-story Beatrice at 839 Avenue of the Americas with 301 rentals; the sprawling T. F. Cornerstone project that stretches several blocks along West 37th Street with more than 1,000 rental units; and the Ohm, a bit farther south in Chelsea at 312 11th Avenue, a 34-story building with 369 rental units. Additionally, two smaller projects are in the mix, the 101-unit +aRt at 537 West 27th Street and the 89-unit Port 10 at 303 10th Avenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All these projects were completed in 2010, the last chapter of a building boom that stretched through much of the decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the Upper West Side, several luxury rental buildings of similar scale also opened over the course of 2010, including the 42-story Aire at 200 West 67th Street, with 310 rentals; the Corner at 200 West 72nd Street, with 192 rentals on 19 floors; the Ashley at 400 West 63rd, with 209 rentals on 25 floors; and the Aldyn, a 40-story building with 136 rental units at 60 Riverside Boulevard. In some of the buildings, like the Aldyn, +aRt and MiMA, condominiums are also in the mix.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gary L. Malin, the president of Citi Habitats, one of the largest residential rental brokers in New York, said that the roughly 3,000 new luxury rental units on the market in the past year might seem too much for the city to absorb, but in reality were just a drop in the bucket. Many of the buildings that opened in 2010 are already nearing full occupancy, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What all the buildings share are soaring prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet while the top-priced apartments costing tens of thousands of dollars a month have received a lot of the attention, they make up a relatively small fraction of the inventory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will be the leasing of studios and one- and two-bedrooms that will determine the success of the projects, developers say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For renters like Christy McCullough, who was one of the first to snap up an apartment at the Corner on the Upper West Side, renting simply made more sense than buying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We were looking to downsize,'' Ms McCullough said in an interview in her impeccably appointed, sunny one-bedroom apartment. One-bedrooms in the building start at about $5,000 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She was so thrilled with the place that she signed a two-year lease; her daughter is also renting an apartment in the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the buildings opened many developers were offering breaks for renters, like paying broker's fees and a month's rent for one-year lease, which adds up quickly, given the prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Corner, nearly full, is no longer offering incentives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeffrey E. Levine, the president of Levine Builders, which operates Douglaston Development, which built the Ohm in Chelsea, said that until last year high-end rental projects were taking something of a beating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If developers had projected getting $65 per square foot, he said, they received closer to $50 per square foot because of the many concessions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the tide began to turn in 2010, just as many of the more ambitious projects were coming onto the market. The Ohm is now fully leased and is concentrating on renewals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If taking a hit in the beginning by offering incentives helps fill up a building, Mr. Levine said, it is worth it because when it comes time for renewals there is less pressure to offer incentives not only to new renters, but also to those already in the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers like to keep the monthly rents at the peak of what they think the market will bear, because it is much harder to raise rents than it is to cut incentives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in the end even the Gehry building, celebrated by both architectural critics and casual observers for what it looks like on the outside, has to convince people to pay for what is on the inside.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A FEW years ago, the Federal Reserve remained complacent about inflation even as a housing bubble inflated. The Fed did not take the kind of action that would have seemed reasonable if it had been alarmed by rising prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the inflation rate is starting to turn up, and there are warnings that the Fed may need to tighten monetary policy even if the stumbling economic recovery does not accelerate. But home prices, which had seemed to be stabilizing a year ago, are falling again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until 1983, the Consumer Price Index included housing costs. But then the index was changed. No longer would home prices directly affect the index. Instead, the Bureau of Labor Statistics makes a calculation of ''owners' equivalent rent,'' which is based on the trend of costs to rent a home, not to buy one. The current approach, the B.L.S. says, ''measures the value of shelter to owner-occupants as the amount they forgo by not renting out their homes.'' The C.P.I. is not supposed to include investments, and owning a house has aspects of both investment and consumption.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever the reasonableness of that approach, the practical effect of the change was to keep the housing bubble from affecting reported inflation rates in the years leading up to the peak in home prices. It is at least possible that the Federal Reserve would have acted differently had the change never been made.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The accompanying charts represent an effort to put together an alternate index of inflation, one that includes home prices rather than the owner's equivalent rate. The effort is far from precise, in large part because the old index was based not just on purchase prices but also on changing mortgage interest rates and on changing property taxes, while this one is based solely on an index of home prices. But it nonetheless gives an approximation of what inflation would have looked like had home prices remained in the index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The effect is particularly notable in the core index, which excludes volatile energy and food prices, and which the Fed monitors closely. In 2004, when home prices were climbing at a rate of almost 10 percent a year -- more than four times the increase in rents -- the core index would have been over 5 percent had home prices been included. Instead, the reported core rate was just 2.2 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed did raise rates in 2004, although perhaps more slowly than seems appropriate in hindsight. The increases then stunned Wall Street, which might not have happened had investors been watching an inflation rate that included home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last few months, the two markets have again diverged, but in the opposite way. From October 2010 through January, home prices as measured by an index kept by <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> fell at an annual rate of 12.4 percent, while the government's calculation of owners' equivalent rent shows it rising at an annual rate of 1.5 percent. Home prices have not yet been reported for February, but the upward trend in rental prices continued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inflation rates may have been understated for years when home prices were rising much more rapidly than rental rates. At the time, the discrepancy might have seemed to be an indication of rising speculation and prompted Fed concern. Now, it is possible that inflation will be overstated precisely because speculative excesses are being purged from the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CHARTS: Since 1983, the Consumer Price Index in the United States has excluded house prices. Instead, it includes ''owners' equivalent rent,'' which is based on rent costs. Had house prices been included, inflation figures would have appeared to be much higher during the housing bubble, and lower after the bubble burst. In recent months, rental costs have begun to recover, but housing prices have started to fall again.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Off the Charts column this week takes a look at inflation and tries to adjust the reports by including home prices. Existing indexes estimate the housing costs for homeowners by measuring the rental value of their homes, not their prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I want to emphasize that the indexes I built are far from exact replicas of the measure that existed before house prices were kicked out of the Consumer Price Index at the end of 1982. I know of no available index of changes in property taxes, which used to be an important part of the housing component of the C.P.I., and I did not try to include mortgage interest costs, as the old index did.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nor am I trying to argue that a revised index is clearly needed. I am old enough to remember the arguments when the change was made in 1982, and there were good reasons for it. There is no perfect measure for inflation - or many other things - available, which is one reason that writing about the economy is fun and challenging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is clear that the way housing costs are measured makes a big difference in inflation rates. At the moment, owners' implicit rent accounts for 23 percent of the C.P.I., more than energy and food combined. And it accounts for 30 percent of the core index, which excludes food and energy. I thought it was worth understanding that we may be at a point when the inflation picture looks very different if housing prices are included. That is something policy makers should take into account.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whenever I write about inflation these days, I get e-mails from readers convinced that there is a conspiracy to cover up rampant price increases. Passions are inflamed because some payments, such as Social Security benefits, are linked to inflation rates. Understating inflation rates would cost recipients money.Some readers mock the use of core inflation rates, and of course they have a point. Energy and food are necessary, and if they cost more we will have less to spend on other things. But there are legitimate reasons for looking at both inflation numbers, and in the long run it turns out the two are not very different. Over the nearly 30-year period I looked at, the overall C.P.I. rose at a compound annual rate of 2.92 percent a year. The figure for the core rate was 2.97 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, the owners' equivalent rate index used by the B.L.S. rose at a rate of 3.41 percent, while the housing index I substituted climbed at a rate of 3.64 percent per year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But using averages can deceive. A glance at the top chart in the column shows that the rent and housing markets could diverge for long periods of time. From the end of 2000 through the end of 2006, rents rose 3.1 percent a year while home prices climbed at a 7.2 percent rate. Since then, rents have gained 1.5 percent per year. Home prices have fallen at a rate of 4.3 percent per year. The economy would be in far better shape if house-price changes had moved in lockstep with rental-rate increases. Putting together the alternative indexes proved to be the hardest statistical task I have undertaken in the years I have been doing the Off the Charts column. Getting the house price inflation rate was relatively easy, although even that had some complications because I decided to switch indexes in 1991, when a better index became available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the course of putting the charts together, I learned more than I ever knew - or perhaps, wanted to know - about how inflation rates were calculated. I never would have been able to do it without patient help from three economists at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, who took the time to explain things to me and to review and help correct errors in the spreadsheets I prepared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are, of course, in no way responsible for my decision to put house prices in an inflation index. They warned me of the pitfalls mentioned in the article, including the lack of a measure for property tax increases. In no sense is my alternative index endorsed by anyone at the B.L.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It turns out that the decision to go to rental prices had other effects not mentioned in the article. Essentially, the current method of calculating the Consumer Price Index assumes that homeowners make some payments as owners of the properties they rent to themselves and others as renters. Only the payments made as renters are counted in the C.P.I. Since most real renters get appliances from the landlord, most appliance costs are considered landlord expenses, and appliances get a lower weight than they once did in the C.P.I.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the readers who send angry e-mails believe that the B.L.S. fudges numbers. I am more confident than ever that is not so, even if I am also more aware of the complexities involved in compiling the figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economists who helped me were Frank Ptacek, Jonathan Church and Steve Reed. Mr. Ptacek is head of the housing section in the division of consumer prices and prices increases of the B.L.S. The others are economists in that division. They have my thanks.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late 2008, with the economy in free fall and the collapse of negotiations with an anchor tenant, Boston Properties halted construction on an office tower at 250 West 55th Street in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now, having signed a letter of intent with a tenant, the law firm Morrison Foerster, Boston Properties is preparing to restart construction of the one-million-square-foot building at year's end. The rough space will be available for tenants by the end of 2013, with occupancy expected in mid-2014.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When we decided to suspend construction, it was in the context of being very unsure of what was happening in the financial world and when leasing velocity would pick back up,'' said Douglas T. Linde, the president and chief financial officer of Boston Properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plans to build the skyscraper, designed by <span class="companylink">Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill</span>, are the latest sign that after three years of tenants ruling the roost, landlords are retaking control of the commercial real estate market. Other signs of a shift include reduced concessions for tenants and higher rents. And, in a few cases, landlords are rejecting deals with some large tenants to sign even larger ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But experts warn that some of the leasing activity is from companies that are relocating or even consolidating after layoffs. Tenants need not fear a spike in rents in the coming months, these people say, but neither should they expect to see rents fall if they wait before signing a lease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate brokers and landlords say employment growth is the critical reason behind the market shift. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, some 140,000 jobs were lost in New York City in the recession. Around 61,000 have since returned, and of those, about three-quarters are office jobs. Some of this has been reflected in leasing activity, with the absorption rate, or the amount of space that was leased versus put on the market, totaling roughly one million square feet last year, according to data from Cushman &amp; Wakefield.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the first quarter of this year the vacancy rate in Class A buildings in Midtown Manhattan was 12.8 percent, according to <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>, compared with 13.9 percent in the first quarter of last year. And in the tower floors of the most desirable Midtown buildings, the rate is closer to 4 percent, said Peter G. Riguardi, the president of New York operations at <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the overall Midtown vacancy rate remains far above equilibrium, considered to be 7 percent to 10 percent, the market is often ''pulled up from the top,'' said Mitchell S. Steir, the chief executive of the real estate services company Studley, which represents tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''During the last up cycle, it was the class A space users like hedge funds and private equity firms that pulled up pricing prematurely, and landlords were able to make it stick.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steven M. Durels, the director for leasing at the <span class="companylink">SL Green Realty Corporation</span>, said landlords had reduced their free rent for office space that must be built out to eight or 10 months from 12 months, which had been more common in recent years. In space that is already built, free rent is now two to three months instead of six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You used to see landlords contribute $75 to $80 a square foot for buildouts, but now we are capping that at $60,'' said Mr. Durels, adding that other changes included smaller security deposits and greater annual rent increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And in the last several months some large tenants that had been negotiating with landlords were bumped when even larger tenants came along.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span>, which is consolidating its offices, was negotiating for roughly 300,000 square feet at 120 Park Avenue, across from Grand Central Terminal, when <span class="companylink">Bloomberg L.P</span>. swooped in and signed a lease for 402,000 square feet. The bank, which brokers say is close to signing a lease at 150 East 42nd Street, declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another negotiation was disrupted when the accounting firm Deloitte signed a lease for 436,000 square feet at 30 Rockefeller Plaza. At the time, the building's landlord had been in talks to renew a lease with the law firm <span class="companylink">Chadbourne &amp; Parke</span>. Deloitte, which will be vacating more than 500,000 square feet at 2 World Financial Center, is redesigning its office use to be more space efficient.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You hear a lot about tenants getting bumped, but some part of this is just the hype that gets created by brokers and owners,'' said Barry M. Gosin, the chief executive of Newmark Knight Frank. ''The market is improved, but people are driven by emotion and what they are told. There is really more of a balance than what landlords would like to see.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marisa Manley, who represents tenants as the president of Commercial Tenant Real Estate Representation, also warned about hype that drives up rents. ''New York City has regained about 40 percent of the jobs it lost since the start of the recession,'' she said, ''but that means it is still down 60 percent.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while a lot of focus is placed on prime Midtown buildings and large blocks of space, a vast number of companies in New York City -- as much as 40 percent according to the research company CoStar Group -- lease less than 2,500 square feet, and for them it is still a tenants' market, Ms. Manley said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the signs have given hope to landlords that may be sitting on hundreds of thousands of square feet of vacant space. SL Green recently acquired an equity stake in 3 Columbus Circle, a building that had been the focus of an ownership struggle between the Related Companies and Joseph Moinian, the financially troubled landlord. With the help of SL Green, Mr. Moinian wrested control and now they are working to lease the largely vacant tower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With asking rents ranging from $60 a square foot in the base to $80 a square foot in the tower, 3 Columbus Circle is priced competitively to similar buildings. So far there are two proposals out on the upper floors and one for a ''very large'' block of space in the base, Mr. Durels of said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I hadn't expected to land my first tenant before the end of the year,'' he said, ''but seeing this much activity this early in the process is another great sign that the market is turning for the best.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHOTOS: Steven M. Durels, the director for leasing at <span class="companylink">SL Green Realty</span>, which acquired an equity stake in 3 Columbus Circle, above, says there is a lot of activity, and he believes the market is improving.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market remains mired in trouble, with plummeting prices and slumping sales. First-time buyers are fleeing, sellers are frustrated, builders are depressed and lenders are skittish about making new loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The numbers are gloomy, no question,'' said the economist Karl E. Case. ''We're bouncing along a rocky bottom.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that, he said, is the optimistic view.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Others think we're falling off another cliff,'' Mr. Case said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing prices slid in January for the sixth consecutive month, putting them barely above the lows reached in the depths of the recession two years ago, according to the index that Mr. Case helped develop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case-Shiller Home Price Index for 20 large cities declined 1 percent from December, putting the slide from its 2006 peak at 31.8 percent, according to data released Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eleven cities hit a new low for the downturn, including Charlotte, N.C., Miami, Tampa, Fla., and New York. Prices in New York have fallen 23 percent from their peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts expected a rough winter, but not quite so brutal. ''We are more negative on housing than we were three months ago,'' said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets. Any recovery will be delayed from this fall until next year, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buying a house is a mix of faith and necessity, but that first element is scarce these days. The Conference Board reported Tuesday that its consumer confidence index tumbled 8.6 percent in March, the first drop in six months and the largest in a year. Only 15 percent of respondents thought their incomes would increase over the next six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the troubles facing the market is a pervasive sense that houses are a bad bet. If prices still have further to fall, if loans are tough to get, if interest rates are no longer plunging, why not put off a deal if you possibly can?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet as Mr. Case suggested, things could be worse. The market is not falling at nearly the rate it was in 2008. All but the gloomiest analysts think the market is much closer to the end of the process than the beginning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An element that is paradoxically working to shore up the market is the millions of foreclosed houses that are not coming back for sale and contributing to the abundance of inventory. Too much inventory pushes down prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders, who are wrangling with policy makers over reforms, placed 21 percent fewer homeowners in foreclosure in January than they did in November, even as the number of loans in severe default was holding steady, according to data released Tuesday by LPS Applied Analytics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason for fewer foreclosures is that more struggling borrowers appear to be making deals with their banks. The percent of severely delinquent loans returning to paid-up status rose to 22 percent from 10 percent over the last year, LPS said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many of the rest, foreclosure is less a process than a destination, the data indicates. Three out of 10 homeowners in foreclosure have not made any payment in at least two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Case-Shiller is a three-month moving average, which means it is resistant to quick changes. On a seasonally adjusted basis, January's drop was 0.2 percent, the same as in December. In the slower winter months, the adjusted numbers are considered less indicative of the market's true condition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices were down 3.1 percent from their levels a year earlier. Only two of the 20 cities in the index recorded price increases during that time: Washington and, barely, San Diego.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First-time buyers, a critical force in the market, have become scarcer since a stimulus program involving tax credits came to an end last spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That really motivated a lot of people to act,'' said Steven Thoele, a broker with <span class="companylink">Keller Williams Realty</span> in Portland, Ore. ''Eight grand in your pocket went a long way to making the numbers work.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Portland reached another low for the current downturn in January. Prices there fell 1.8 percent from December. They are now down 27 percent from their 2007 peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You do kind of wonder where the bottom is,'' said Mr. Thoele. ''Sellers know in the back of their mind that their home is worth less than at the peak, but they're still a little surprised when you tell them their $400,000 house is now worth $300,000.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atlanta, Cleveland, Detroit and Las Vegas are now below their average prices of 11 years ago, and Phoenix is nearly there. Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas and Minneapolis are not doing much better. After adjusting for inflation, the struggles in these cities are even more pronounced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller release capped a run of weak housing reports. Existing-home sales were down in February by nearly 10 percent from January, the National Association of Realtors reported last week, much worse than expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales in February were 14 percent below forecasts, according to the Census Bureau. At an annual rate of 250,000, sales were the lowest since the advent of comprehensive record-keeping in 1963.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one hopeful note, the National Association of Realtors said this week that pending home sales rose 2.1 percent in February. Those deals, which will become final in March and April, indicate that sales are unlikely to continue to tumble, which could help stabilize prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The spring market could have some good surprises,'' said Mr. Case, the economist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I say that with absolutely no conviction.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IT seemed fitting for the developers of the Isis, a new high-rise condominium in Yorkville, to invite local first graders to watch the building's construction. The neighborhood on the Upper East Side, once a German enclave of low- and midrise apartments, is becoming more popular with families because of its excellent schools and good real estate values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact Alchemy Properties, the developer of the 32-unit Isis at 303 East 77th Street and Second Avenue designed the tower to have only apartments of two bedrooms or more, which could also be easily combined to make even larger living spaces for families. Isis is within walking distance of Public School 290, where the first graders attend school.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yorkville, bounded by 72nd Street to the south and 96th Street to the north, and stretching from Third Avenue to the East River, has in recent years been popular among young professionals new to the working world. But an onslaught of development since the mid-2000s has removed some of the housing stock once favored by young, single people and replaced it with larger condominiums typically appealing to families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Kenneth S. Horn, the president of Alchemy, put it, ''We determined that in this particular area, it would be better to do a bit larger units as opposed to, say, another project we're doing now on the Far West Side, where we have studios, one-bedrooms and one-bedrooms with dens.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Isis is almost half sold, he said, ''and I don't think we've sold to any single people.'' The developers threw a pizza party for their first-grade observers when they topped off the building in mid-2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data provided by Miller Samuel Inc., a Manhattan real estate appraisal company, shows that 25 apartments of three bedrooms or more were sold in Yorkville in 2009, and 26 last year, compared with fewer than 10 in each of the two previous years. Over that time the number of studio sales shrank steadily, while the number of one-bedroom sales fell in the recession and then rebounded a bit in 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stuart Moss, a senior vice president and associate broker at <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, said the new developments in Yorkville, which include three on East 85th Street -- the Lucida, at No. 151; the Brompton, at No. 205; and the <span class="companylink">Georgica</span>, at No. 305 --''have taken over a lot of those smaller, less-expensive former-tenement-type places that might have appealed to younger professionals.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some developers have found themselves combining apartments to create larger spaces, including those of the Brompton and the Lucida. Others including Alchemy have started out with mostly larger apartments. (In Alchemy's case, the developer also included a popular line of two-bedroom apartments with a smaller kitchen-dining area and a ''den'' that could be used as a children's playroom, among other things.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The developers of the Azure, at 333 East 91st Street and First Avenue, the Mattone Group and the DeMatteis Organizations, began with 110 apartments of two bedrooms or larger (and only 18 studios or one-bedrooms), and have continually found themselves combining apartments for buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We structured our building to allow for a combination of two two-bedroom apartments into a 3,000-square-foot four-bedroom,'' said Douglas MacLaury, the senior vice president for development at the Mattone Group, ''and that's been one of our more successful products.'' The building, which has a children's playroom and a game room for teens, is about a third sold, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices for new condominiums are $1,400 to $1,600 a square foot, Mr. Moss said, adding that an older co-op apartment might go for $800 to $900 a square foot. Combined apartments are becoming more common in the area's co-ops, he said. Rena Goldstein, an associate broker with Halstead Properties who lives in Yorkville with her husband and 21-year-old son, agreed. She combined two units to create her three-bedroom apartment at 200 East 78th Street and Third Avenue</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Large apartments -- larger than two bedrooms -- are not that common in the older buildings,'' Ms. Goldstein said. ''So you'll see in my building, for instance, there are a lot of combinations where people have put apartments together.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yorkville's appeal to families is enhanced by its excellent public schools, as well as its many preschools. The Upper East Side, of which Yorkville is a part, also has some of the best private schools in the world, Mr. Moss said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The neighborhood has two attractive parks -- Carl Schurz Park, the site of Gracie Mansion, and the smaller John Jay Park -- plus Asphalt Green, a nonprofit community recreation center on 5.5 acres with an Olympic-size pool, a fitness center and sports offerings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides a variety of children's activity centers, like Kidville on East 84th Street and the Art Farm in the City on East 91st, Yorkville has a number of stores like Gymboree and Planet Kids, which sell the necessities of childhood. Many restaurants are themed for children, and those that aren't typically welcome them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are a lot of kid-friendly cafes, where you don't have to apologize for having a screaming kid,'' said Jenny Rozenblat, who rents a 900-square-foot one-bedroom on 81st Street and First Avenue for $2,100 a month with her husband and 9-month-old daughter, Nadia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As her daughter grows, Ms. Rozenblat said, she and her husband will probably find a new apartment -- but only a few blocks west, within Yorkville, to get Nadia into the highly rated Public School 6, on 81st between Madison and Park. ''It feels like it's an understanding community here,'' she said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ANYONE unfamiliar with northern Queens could be forgiven for imagining that living at the foot of the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge might be more likely to involve sleeping on a flattened cardboard box than in a sprawling multimillion-dollar home with a swimming pool. But despite its traditionally low profile, the 100-year-old residential enclave of Malba, nestled just to the west of the bridge along the gently undulating waters of Powell's Cove, is one of the most upscale and picturesque neighborhoods in the borough.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 10-minute drive from Citi Field and its vanished predecessor, Shea Stadium, Malba has been home to luminaries like William A. Shea, the influential lawyer for whom the ballpark was named, and Roberto Alomar, the former New York Mets second baseman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nine months ago, Mr. Alomar's palatial 15-room house, on North Drive in Malba, sold for $2.8 million, the highest price fetched by a single-family home in Queens last year, according to Mitchell Slavuter, the broker-owner of Prime</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Realty, who handled the deal. The residence, with its basement gym and movie theater, sits on an 11,650-square-foot lot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The beauty of Malba is that it's one of the few neighborhoods in Queens where you get a good amount of land with your property,'' Mr. Slavuter said. ''The average-size lot for Queens is 40 by 100, but in Malba you find lots two, three, four, even five times that size.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Malba was settled beginning in 1908, the houses were built smaller than those allowed by today's zoning. As a result, a stampede of buyers has descended on the waterfront community over the last decade, razing high ranches and Cape Cods, and replacing them with larger, often lavish new homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I sold one for $2.8 million, and they knocked it down,'' said Mary Ann Stravello, broker-owner of E &amp; M Real Estate in Whitestone. ''I sold another two for $4.5 million, and they knocked them down. So then the valuation of what was built came in so much higher that they call it the Beverly Hills of the East Coast.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether or not this nickname is a bit of local hyperbole, the construction of showy new palaces, often in a Mediterranean style with red Spanish-tiled roofs, persists on Malba's tree-lined streets. Among those who have kept contractors busy is Elvira Laurita, a Queens public school teacher, and her husband, Saverino Mercadante, a lawyer who works in Manhattan. In 2006, the couple paid $900,000 for a 1920s colonial on Parsons Boulevard, a block from the Whitestone Expressway service road.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before moving in from neighboring College Point, they gave their new house a more contemporary look, adding two exterior balconies with decorative ironwork, as well as a grand 25-foot-high entry space. Two years and half a million dollars later, the couple moved in with their two small sons. When school is out, Ms. Laurita takes the boys picnicking on Malba's beachfront, or fishing off its jetty. ''We feed the geese,'' she said. ''They love it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lately she has been itching to move again, but only to a larger home in Malba. ''There's no commercial property in the neighborhood,'' she said, ''so it's like living in the suburbs. But it's right in the city. If I want to go to a show it's 20 minutes, and I see the Empire State Building from my window.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT YOU'LL FIND</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all the expensive transformation this enclave of 410 houses has undergone in recent years, the community -- and it is a community -- retains a quaintness that can be traced to Malba's origins in a much less urbanized time. The area was developed for wealthy boaters and fishermen on 163 acres bought by William Ziegler, the ''Baking Powder King.'' The neighborhood's name is an acronym derived from the first letters of the surnames of Malba's five founders, all men from New Haven, Conn., who were affiliated with a subsidiary of the Royal Baking Powder Company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To preserve Malba's character and prevent commercial development, the ''forefathers'' (as Kathleen Georgio, the president of the Malba Association, calls them with a chuckle) set limits on where houses could be built. They also kept title to the beachfront; to this day, Ms. Georgio said, the group protects its control of the waterfront in court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The association collects $325 a year from each household in its fluctuating membership of 100 to 175. It uses these voluntary dues to maintain a private security patrol and to tend the waterfront and three commonly owned triangles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within one of these triangles stands an antique guardhouse, which was restored in 2005 by the all-male Malba Field and Marine Club. Malba also has a garden club and a women's club, which hosts tea parties at its 1910 clubhouse. A monthly newsletter, Malba News and Views, is delivered to residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have a chitchat column, which keeps everyone in touch with their neighbors: who's sick, who had a baby, who's graduating,'' said Ingrid Longo, the editor. ''Maybe it's because of the clubs, but we have an interest in each other that brings us all closer together.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joseph Isaakidis, an owner of a pharmacy in Whitestone, says camaraderie drew him to Malba, along with his long love of one particular house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Growing up in Whitestone in the 1980s, he had a fondness for a ''cool old castle-looking house'' he used to ride his bike past in Malba. In 2005, he spotted a ''For Sale'' sign in the yard. An old dream came alive, and Mr. Isaakidis paid $1.4 million for the house, a four-bedroom three-and-a-half-bath English Tudor on Point Crescent with a view of the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and his wife, Maryann, turned the attached garage into a family room, which they kept architecturally consistent by installing stained-glass windows from another Tudor scheduled for demolition. The work cost about $500,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Mr. Isaakidis, Malba's only drawback was its lack of a dock for the 28-foot cruiser he keeps in College Point. The Malba marina burned down around 1988. But a solution is near. On April 15, the Malba Yacht Club will open a $1.1 million marina at the tip of Malba Drive, funded by 29 residents who paid $30,000 to $40,000 each for slips.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The club will not allow parking, instead shuttling slip holders to the pier, which means that Mr. Isaakidis's family can be waiting for him on their boat when he arrives from his pharmacy after work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Within a minute you're in Long Island Sound,'' he said, ''and cruising at whatever speed you like.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT YOU'LL PAY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only detached homes are permitted in Malba, where houses fall into two general categories: older and usually built in the 1920s to 1950s, or bigger and newer. The older houses include high ranches and colonials. Among the newer homes, Mediterranean designs are common, including eye-catching extravaganzas like a columned, salmon-pink stucco palazzo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the most part, ''you're not going to get into Malba for less than a million dollars,'' said Ms. Stravello of E &amp; M Real Estate. ''And generally anything right on the water is $3 million and up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Homeowners whose property adjoins the strip of waterfront land owned by the Malba Association are usually permitted passive use of the beachfront, said Nicholas Kaizer, the group's vice president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Slavuter of Prime Realty says that older houses do occasionally sell for $800,000 or less, but only on Malba's outskirts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventory is typically low. A recent look found 13 houses for sale; 5 sold in 2009 and 7 last year, most for $1 million to $1.3 million. Mr. Slavuter said that most houses sold in that price range were being knocked down or expanded. ''You can't find anything for under $1.6 million that's newly renovated with a decent number of rooms,'' he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT TO DO</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On June 25, a beachfront roast-pig luau will celebrate the marina's grand opening. Every September, the Malba Field and Marine Club hosts a family hot dog party and vintage car show. Spa Castle, a 100,000-square-foot Korean spa in College Point, is a popular sanctuary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE SCHOOLS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many children attend private schools. The Holy Trinity Roman Catholic Elementary School in Whitestone has programs for 2- and 3-year-olds, as well as prekindergarten through Grade 8. From there, some children attend St. Francis Preparatory School, a high school in Fresh Meadows, where SAT averages last year were 538 in reading, 550 in math and 550 in writing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Malba is zoned for Public School 79 in Whitestone, which covers prekindergarten through fifth grade; the school got a C on its most recent progress report. Children in Grades 6 through 8 attend Junior High School 194, also in Whitestone, which earned an A.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearby public high schools include Flushing High School, where SAT averages last year were 372, 398 and 366. Some children attend the selective Bronx High School of Science, which had averages of 632, 685 and 643. Citywide averages were 439, 462 and 434.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE COMMUTE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Midtown Manhattan is about 30 minutes away via the QM2 express bus. The Bronx is a five-minute drive; Nassau County takes 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE HISTORY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The streets of Malba were privately owned until the 1980s, when they were turned over to the city.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TO judge by the overall level of home sales in the United States, the housing market has stabilized at a level well below the peak period of 2005 and 2006 but still higher than the sales rates that characterized prosperous periods in the 1980s and 1990s. Still, few of those sales are of new homes and a rising proportion are forced sales of homes no longer worth the amount that was borrowed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As can be seen in the accompanying chart, during the 12 months through February, about 46 homes were sold for every 1,000 households in the country. At the peak of the housing boom, that figure rose above 75, but the current level is significantly higher than the lows reached during the recessions of the early 1980s and early 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales rate for existing homes -- about 4.9 million over the last 12 months -- is virtually the same as in mid-1999. Yet sales of newly built single-family homes have plunged to the lowest levels seen since the government began collecting statistics on such sales in 1963. The Census Bureau reported this week that only 17,000 new homes were sold in February, for an annual rate of 250,000 after taking seasonal factors into account. Both of those numbers are the lowest on record.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The February sales pace was undoubtedly depressed by harsh weather in the Northeast, and a rebound in March or April is possible. But the total number of homes sold over the 12-month period -- 349,000 -- is lower than in any comparable period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, this cycle has been very different from previous ones. Home sales plunged in the early 1980s, when a combination of severe recession and high interest rates devastated the housing business, and they also suffered in 1990 and 1991, another recessionary period. But in each of those recessions, sales of new and existing homes declined at about the same pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was decreased demand that hurt sales in previous downturns. Now demand is down, in part because some would-be buyers cannot qualify for mortgages that would have been available during the boom. But oversupply is also a major problem now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Too many houses were built in many areas during the boom, and now housing starts have plunged, as can be seen in the bottom chart. There are fewer newly built homes available, and in some areas, buyers complain that builders have not been willing to cut prices to meet the prices available on used homes in the same area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there is a large number of used homes available. The National Association of Realtors estimates that almost two of every five used homes sold in February were on the market because the previous owner was in trouble. It says 26 percent of sales were from foreclosures, and an additional 13 percent were ''short sales,'' in which the lender agrees to allow the homeowner to sell the home for less than the outstanding balance of the loan. Sellers often have little say in the timing of such sales, and are in a poor bargaining position.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The percentage of forced sales rose to nearly half of all sales in early 2009, at the height of the credit crisis, but fell to around 30 percent as the economy began to improve and banks imposed moratoriums on foreclosures. Now it is on the rise again, producing new pressures on prices and increased competition for home builders still trying to sell homes built in more optimistic times.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SPRINGDALE, Ark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JUST before 9 a.m. on a recent March morning, Mark Flake was working the phone at his office here in northwest Arkansas. The phones have been ringing lately, and that's a good thing because Mr. Flake is a real estate agent and a property manager -- and it wasn't long ago that things were painfully quiet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I will never complain about being busy,'' said Mr. Flake, 41, a trim sandy-haired man in khakis and a yellow polo shirt with a <span class="companylink">Weichert Realtors</span> logo. In fact, Mr. Flake had one of his best income years last year -- a relief after the brutal slowdown of 2008 and 2009, when his income plunged by about 30 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop in pay, with mounting medical bills and a curve ball in their personal life, led Mr. Flake and his wife, Amy, to exhaust their savings. As they shifted spending to credit cards their debt mounted, and conversations about retirement saving took a back seat to making the mortgage payments on their home in nearby Rogers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with his income now beginning to stabilize, Mr. Flake has been taking stock. He and his wife aren't as bad off as some -- they still own their home and, while they've lost equity, they don't think it's worth less than their $150,000 mortgage. Mr. Flake has some real estate holdings, including a pair of rental duplexes and part of a limited liability company that owns commercial property. He expected those holdings to pay off in the long term, but they wouldn't yield much if sold at current prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has added to his income by managing clients' properties as well as his own. His emergency cash, though, has dwindled to $1,000, and he has no formal retirement fund. He knows he should save for retirement, but says the very notion of retirement is alien to him. ''I don't think I'm ever going to retire,'' he said, shaking his head.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, he can foresee a future in which, perhaps, he won't have to be constantly on call for clients or tenants, as he is now. But a major impediment to saving for that day is that the Flakes must first pay off debt they accumulated during the property bust -- roughly $55,000, excluding their mortgage and a car payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A chunk of the total is student loans, but much of the debt was run up on credit cards covering expenses like medical treatment and operations for two of their children. ''It adds up,'' said Mrs. Flake, 37, in a telephone interview from her home. ''The last couple of years have been tough.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adding to the strain on their budget was the unexpected addition of a family member. In October 2008, they learned that a relative of hers with an 8-month-old son was going to prison. If the Flakes could not take the baby, he would be placed in foster care. The Flakes did some soul searching and decided to seek custody of the boy, delaying a plan by Mrs. Flake to resume working. ''It's not every day,'' Mr. Flake said, ''you have the chance to do something that can really change someone's life.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last fall, though, Mr. Flake realized his financial situation was precarious. A credit counseling service helped him negotiate a consolidation loan to pay off his nonsecured debt at an interest rate of about 3 percent. He expects to pay it off in about four years. ''You really can't save effectively until you've got that off your back,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ann Garcia, a financial planner in Portland, Ore., with Maas Capital Advisors, said in a phone interview that the Flakes' predicament ''isn't terribly unusual,'' given the lingering effects of the housing collapse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Garcia's own family has seen its share of economic ups and downs -- her husband works in technology, as she once did, and has endured six layoffs in the last 15 years. That's why it's crucial to have a cash cushion, she says, and that should be the Flakes' first priority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Garcia supports Mr. Flake's commitment to ridding himself of debt. But she advises keeping that goal in perspective as his income stabilizes. (He made about $65,000 last year from his real estate holdings, property management business and home sales commissions combined, and expects to make about the same this year.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes, when there is money left after covering his expenses and the minimum debt payment of $1,200 a month, Mr. Flake makes extra debt payments. Ms. Garcia advises against that. For now, anything after expenses should be used to build emergency savings, and then to begin a retirement fund. ''Their bigger priority is to build up cash savings,'' Ms. Garcia said, a goal that was attainable with ''strict'' budgeting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Typically, Ms. Garcia would suggest that a couple tap their home for a line of credit for use in emergencies. But she said that was not an option because of the Flakes' debt. To simplify savings, she suggested that Mr. Flake deposit his earnings into a savings account and transfer a preset amount into his checking account to cover monthly expenses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once the couple builds more of a cushion -- she recommends six months of living expenses, but said three months might be a more realistic goal for the Flakes -- then they can think about a retirement fund, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Garcia says Roth I.R.A.'s make the most sense because they can be opened with low initial contributions. They can put in $5,000 a year each, for a total of $10,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Roths are financed with after-tax money, so withdrawals are income-tax free -- an important consideration for Mr. Flake, who plans to continue working as long as possible and so is likely to be in a higher income bracket at retirement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, if the accounts have been open for at least five years, they can be used to help pay for their children's college costs. With that in mind, Mrs. Garcia advises the Flakes to open Roth I.R.A.'s in 2013, when their oldest child is 13, so they could be used penalty-free for education needs when he is college age.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Mr. Flake's real estate ventures continue to grow, he could consider a business-based retirement plan, like a simplified employee pension plan, or SEP, which would let him put more money away, Ms. Garcia says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One possibility Mr. Flake might weigh, Ms. Garcia adds, is speaking to his parents about a ''lifetime gift''-- a way for parents to give their heirs an inheritance, while they are living.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If his parents were able to make a gift, Ms. Garcia said, Mr. Flake should put at least half into emergency savings and use the rest to pay down his debt. Mrs. Flake and the children have health insurance, but Mr. Flake does not. Ms. Garcia urged him to get a short-term ''catastrophic only'' plan, often available for less than $100 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, Mr. Flake said, he liked Ms. Garcia's advice ''I think it can be done,'' he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MIAMI -- Bucking a trend that has curtailed development in other cities, the downtown Miami skyline has two shiny new office towers, its first since 2004, and will soon have a third. More office space was added in Miami last year -- 1.3 million square feet -- than in any other American city except Washington, which grew by 2.5 million square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the vacancy rate in Miami's central business district is 22 percent, about twice that of the nation's capital, according to the real estate services firm <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the empty space, the Foram Group of Miami recently announced that it would proceed with a 40-story office tower at 600 Brickell Avenue, a project that had stalled in January 2009 because of the economic downturn. Expected to be completed in August, the building will add 600,000 square feet to the downtown office market. No leases have been signed so far.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Miami building spree has proved a bonanza for tenants, as landlords have competed feverishly by offering many months of free rent and generous financial help in creating new offices. Though annual asking rents in the new buildings are above $40 a square foot, brokers said tenants were actually paying considerably less than that when the concessions were taken into account.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some tenants have even saved money by moving because they have been able to fit the same number of employees into less space. And they have been spared the challenges of trying to reconfigure existing space or the headaches associated with remodeling, said Diana L. Parker, a director at Cushman &amp; Wakefield of Florida. ''It's hard to live through a renovation,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though downtown Miami is rapidly becoming a lively residential neighborhood, office leasing is of course driven by jobs. The unemployment rate in Miami-Dade County has begun to decline, but it still stands at 12 percent. The two new completed buildings, 1450 Brickell Avenue, at the southern end of Miami's business district, and <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> Center, at 333 Avenue of the Americas, near the northern end, have managed to lure tenants from other buildings. ''The last generation of buildings are being left with big open spaces,'' said Robert Kaplan, a principal of Asentus Real Estate, a real estate investment firm in Miami. ''The question is how do these get backfilled?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October, a major Miami law firm, Bilzin Sumberg, moved into 80,000 square feet in 1450 Brickell, leaving a 90,000-square-foot hole at the Southeast Financial Center at 200 South Biscayne Boulevard. That building also lost the accounting firm Deloitte &amp; Touche, which relocated to the new <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bilzin Sumberg originally had been slated to move to 600 Brickell, but it backed out of that deal in early 2009, citing the construction delay. Postponing the move enabled the firm to take advantage of lower rents and construction costs resulting from the downturn, said Carey A. Stiss, a Bilzin Sumberg partner. ''Because of the timing, we had a savings in the seven figures,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Greenberg Traurig</span>, a major law firm that lost many of its windows at 1221 Brickell Avenue in Hurricane Wilma in 2005, was able to pare its footprint to 125,000 square feet from 168,000 square feet by moving. By relocating to the <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> Center, the firm could dispense with its full kitchen and a series of dining rooms, said the new building's broker, Jack Lowell, a vice president of Flagler Real Estate Services. The law firm now has access whenever it wants to a private dining room at the adjacent Marriott Marquis hotel, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the standards of Miami, which has few corporate or regional headquarters, <span class="companylink">Greenberg Traurig</span> and Bilzin Sumberg are huge tenants. ''This is a 5,000-foot market,'' said Danet Linares, an executive vice president of Blanca Commercial Real Estate, the local firm representing 1450 Brickell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some landlords, anticipating the competition from the new towers, took steps early on to retain longtime tenants by lowering the rent and sprucing up their buildings. The owner of 701 Brickell Avenue, the financial services firm <span class="companylink">TIAA-CREF</span>, was able to keep its major tenant, <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>, in the 1986 building, in part by moving the bank within the building. ''Over all, they got a great deal,'' said Scott Strickland, a senior vice president of <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>, the landlord's broker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each new building has sought to differentiate itself from its rivals. After the Rilea Group, the Miami firm that developed 1450 Brickell, said that its building would be able to withstand hurricane winds of 327 miles per hour, Foram countered that its building could handle winds up to 334 m.p.h. Both 1450 Brickell and <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> Center meet gold LEED energy-efficiency standards, so Foram went for a much rarer platinum designation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> Center emphasizes easy access from the downtown exit off Interstate 95 and its proximity to several restaurants. But Alan Ojeda, the chief executive of Rilea, contended that both <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> Center and 600 Brickell were too close to the Brickell Bridge, which spans the busy Miami River and backs up traffic when it opens. Last year, the drawbridge was raised 4,990 times, according to the Florida Department of Transportation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ojeda pointed out that his new office tower was in a less congested section than the others and offered unobstructed views in all directions. Responding to Hurricane Wilma, which littered Brickell Avenue with shattered glass and even cracked top-floor windows in one building, Mr. Ojeda decided to use high-impact glass throughout 1450 Brickell, exceeding local building standards. The additional protection, and an extra-large second generator, added about $25 a square foot to the building's $240 million cost, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 35-story building, which was completed in March, is more than 60 percent leased. Aside from Bilzin, major tenants include several banks, the corporate recruiting company <span class="companylink">Korn/Ferry International</span> and <span class="companylink">American Express</span>. Ms. Linares said 12 of the 28 tenants were new to the Miami office market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the opposite end of the central business district, the 47-story <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> Center, which was developed by the insurance giant <span class="companylink">MetLife</span> and the MDM Development Group of Miami, is 40 percent leased. <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> acquired naming rights by taking 90,000 square feet. The building has a bowling alley, a basketball court and the requisite gym. A <span class="companylink">Whole Foods Market</span> will open in the base of a 10-level parking garage that <span class="companylink">MetLife</span> and MDM are building across the street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though 600 Brickell has no tenants yet, Foram Group said its broker, <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>, began marketing the building only last month, after Canyon Capital Realty Advisors of Los Angeles made a $130 million construction loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Loretta H. Cockrum, the chief executive of Foram, said that when a decision was made two years ago to slow construction -- she contended it did not stop entirely -- Foram sought ways to make the building stand out. The tower will offer the most advanced fiber optic technology, a feature aimed at appealing to media companies and financial services firms seeking trading floors. Of the new buildings, 600 Brickell is the only one in an enterprise zone, which will allow tenants to qualify for tax incentives, Ms. Cockrum said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Cockrum said she hoped to introduce new industries to Miami. ''It doesn't help the city to move a tenant from Building A to Building B,'' she said. ''We believe we are going to attract a lot of out-of-market businesses and tenants.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4:22 p.m. | Updated to correct current limit on conforming home loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new-home sales numbers for February came out today, and they are horrible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government estimates that 19,000 new single-family homes were sold during the month. That is the lowest figure for any month since the figures began to be compiled in 1963. At a seasonally adjusted annual rate, that works out to an annual pace of 250,000. That, too, is the lowest ever.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">February can, of course, be explained away by bad weather. But this is also the lowest 12 months ever, with sales of 349,000 new homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes are not robust, but they have stabilized. Mortgages are more available now than they were a year ago, particularly for so-called "conforming mortgages." But there is an oversupply of housing in many areas, and the home construction business seems unlikely to recover for a long time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based on seasonally adjusted annual rates, here are the 20 slowest months since 1963. I've italicized the ones that came before the housing market peaked in 2006. There are only four. 1- Feb-2011 250,000 2- Aug-2010 274,000 3- Oct-2010 280,000 4- May-2010 282,000 5- Jul-2010 283,000 6- Nov-2010 286,000 7- Jan-2011 301,000 8- Jun-2010 310,000 9- Sep-2010 317,000 10- Dec-2010 333,000 11- Sep-1981 338,000 12- Jan-2009 339,000 13- Apr-1982 339,000 14- Apr-2009 341,000 15- Feb-2010 347,000 16- Jan-2010 349,000 17- Mar-2009 350,000 18- Dec-2009 356,000 19- Oct-1981 356,000 20- Sep-1966 358,000</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last spring there was a small revival in sales of new homes. We knew then that it was brought on by a temporary tax credit for buyers, and when sales fell off in the summer we could explain that as an equally temporary phenomenon, the result of sales being brought forward by the credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now those temporary effects should have gone away. Instead, sales get worse and worse. Next fall, on Oct. 1, the conforming loan limits for Fannie and Freddie will decline. Now they will guarantee mortgages up to $729,750 in some high-cost areas. Unless Congress acts - and the Obama administration says it should not - the limit will fall to a maximum of $625,500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A vast majority of new homes being sold now are below those levels, anyway, so perhaps that won't matter that much. But it won't help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'll have more to say on this in the Off the Charts column. But the bottom line is that we are experiencing something not seen before -- a complete disconnect between sales rates of new and existing homes.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Sales of previously owned homes fell sharply in February and prices hit their lowest level in nearly nine years, a real estate trade group said Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales fell 9.6 percent month over month to an annual rate of 4.88 million units, snapping three straight months of gains, according to the report. The percentage decline was the largest since July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists polled by Reuters had expected February sales to fall 4.0 percent to a pace of 5.15 million units from the previously reported 5.36 million unit rate in January. January's pace was revised up slightly to 5.40 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a frustrating number,'' said David Carter, chief investment officer at Lenox Advisors in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The U.S. residential real estate market doesn't seem to want to turn around despite better affordability.'' Financial markets largely ignored the data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report, released by the National Association of Realtors, said the median home price fell 5.2 percent in February from a year earlier to $156,100, the lowest since April 2002.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If the price declines persist, even with the job market recovery, that could hamper recovery in the housing market,'' the association's chief economist, Lawrence Yun, said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreclosures and short sales, which typically occur below market value, accounted for 39 percent of transactions in February, up from 37 percent in the previous month, the trade group said. All-cash purchases made up a record 33 percent of transactions in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales fell across the board, with multifamily dwellings declining 10 percent and single-family home units dropping 9.6 percent. Compared with February last year, overall sales were down 2.8 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At February's sales pace, the supply of existing homes on the market rose to 8.6 months' worth from 7.5 in January. A supply of six to seven months is generally considered ideal, with longer times indicating a lowering of house prices.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let's begin with the mystery of the hidden bathroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's the summer of 2008. A young couple decides to buy an 800-square-foot apartment in a new condo building on the gentrifying outer edge of a fashionable Brooklyn neighborhood. The buyers go to close on the place, and as they're signing away half a million dollars, the building's developer, keeping a wary eye on the hovering lawyers, leans over and whispers something. There's a second bathroom in the apartment, he says, one that does not appear on the floor plan -- its doorway is concealed behind an inconspicuous layer of drywall. At first, the buyers think the developer is kidding. This is before the crash, near the peak of the market, and no one's giving away a square inch. But the developer says no, he's dead serious, just look. So a few days after they buy the place, the couple takes a sledgehammer to their wall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This building was the handiwork of the architect Robert Scarano.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I first heard this particular Scarano story -- one of many in a genre -- from a friend, an architect, over beers at our neighborhood bar in Brooklyn. She told it the way a stockbroker might relate the misdeeds of Bernie Madoff, her professional disapproval commingled with a distinct sense of wonderment at the things the guy got away with, at least for a while. Through the mid-2000s, a period roughly coinciding with the real estate bubble, Scarano was one of the city's most productive architects, and certainly its most controversial, an omnipresent force in the outer-borough building boom that transformed row-house streets and industrial districts into colonies of stucco and sake bars. Working on hundreds of projects, many of them small-scale buildings that could be constructed quickly, without the rigmarole of public hearings, he remolded entire neighborhoods in his steely, angular, brash -- some would say garish -- style.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It wasn't aesthetics, though, that made Scarano the defining draftsman of that brief and ultimately delusional moment. It was the way he created room. In a city of cramped living, where space is guarded as jealously as Bedouin water, Scarano's buildings were designed to stimulate a primal pleasure center. They were loftlike, with soaring ceilings that drove their heights above the roofline and their prices to levels unheard of in formerly marginal neighborhoods. Enemies of overdevelopment protested that his towering designs were ugly and out of context, while other architects groused that he was circumventing the constraints of the zoning code. Scarano countered that his competitors just weren't creative enough, that he thought in cubic feet, not square, delivering more light, more air and more space to an eager buying public. And, not incidentally, more profit to his clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A hidden room, though, added another dimension -- one that couldn't be explained by craft or capitalism. Why wall off such precious space? My architect friend contacted the condo's owner, a relative, and he agreed to show me his apartment, on the condition that I not reveal its location or his name. (He's still uncertain of all the legalities.) On a weekend afternoon, I found the owner watching basketball in his living room, beneath a 15-foot ceiling, with the afternoon sun streaming in through a window almost as tall. Up a steep set of metal stairs, above an open kitchen, was a mezzanine loft -- Scarano's signature design element -- where the man kept an office. In the loft's far corner, next to a washer-dryer, was the beige-tiled second bathroom. A contractor had finished the door, but otherwise, it was exactly as the couple had found it behind the drywall. ''There were a couple of dust bunnies,'' he said, ''but other than that it was a brand new shower, brand new sink, the light bulbs worked, the toilet flushed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The owner wasn't sure what had happened. He knew about Scarano's very public fall, amid myriad claims of malpractice, lawsuits and tabloid headlines that branded him a ''Building Blockhead'' and ''Architect of Ruin?'' But he had no complaints; he was happy with his surprise gift. ''It was the most amazing thing,'' he said. ''It was like an oasis of a bathroom.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the question remained, what was it doing behind a wall?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This, to me, is what it's about,'' Robert Scarano said. ''The feeling of space when you're in the room.'' On an unseasonably lovely February day, the architect, dressed in a charcoal-colored pinstriped suit, strode through an apartment in Vere 26, a high-rise building in Long Island City. A pair of sunglasses was perched on his wavy mane of hair, which matched the shade of the stainless-steel kitchen. Scarano waved his hand across the skyline of Manhattan, which embraced the room through floor-to-ceiling glass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along the vista, old oaks like the Empire State Building and the U.N. headquarters stood amid the fresh shoots of the last decade. It was, in fact, a period of architectural flowering. ''A lot of people over the years said that New York doesn't have a lot of good architecture,'' Scarano said. Critics used to wonder aloud about the city's lost spirit of innovation and bemoan decades of monolithic blandness -- but then, around 2000, tastes changed. Or, to be more precise, developers figured out that their buildings would be more popular and profitable if they were presented as the work of great artists: ''starchitects,'' the marketers called them. And so, eminent names like Norman Foster, Renzo Piano and Frank Gehry were invited to leave their mark on the skyline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scarano had offered to meet me at Vere 26, after a long period of litigation-/related silence, in order to make a categorical point: that in his own scaled-down, pragmatic, outer-borough way, he, too, deserved to be counted as an artist. For this building, set on an elongated corner lot, he was forced to grapple with zoning rules that appeared to mandate a ponderous, blocky structure. He worked around the restrictions by surrounding the building with a decorative lattice -- ''a sprightly frame of white painted steel,'' as it was described in an approving write-up in the latest edition of the A.I.A. Guide to New York City, a canonical volume. The guide's authors had given much fainter praise to several other Scarano buildings, but the architect seized on his very mention as a vindication. The book appeared as his business was reeling and the city government, claiming misconduct, was fighting to ban him from practicing his profession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People ask me why I didn't just fold up my tent and move,'' Scarano said. ''We stood there under the microscope, with 10,000 watts of light on us . . . because it's easy to stand there when you believe in what you do.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scarano is stubborn and pugnacious by nature, a defiant son of Brooklyn. He lives in Gravesend, in a colonial that his grandfather used to own, to which he recently added an enormous A-framed front window. In a highly stratified profession, divided between a name-brand elite of ''design architects'' and a vastly larger population of ''developers' architects,'' who work with more mundane budgets and expectations, Scarano represents an odd amalgam. He's a speculator's auteur. ''We were trying to really raise the bar,'' he said, ''for those people who were typically not as concerned about doing projects of an aesthetic note.'' Whatever his buildings lack, it isn't ambition -- they're always more than they have to be, which is precisely the trouble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scarano's father was a mechanical engineer, who sent his son to City College with the intent of bringing him into the trade. Although the younger Scarano diverged from that plan, he has always prided himself on his mastery of gritty practicalities: permits, zoning, the trade in air rights, which allow building density to be transferred from one property to another. Setting up his practice in Brooklyn, Scarano developed a reputation as someone who brought an element of flair to even modest projects. He was well positioned when, in the early 2000s, affluent professionals began their mass migration across the East River. ''He has an extreme talent when it comes to designing a unique piece of property,'' says Elan Padeh, founder of a consulting firm called the Developers Group, which spearheaded the gentrification in neighborhoods like Williamsburg. ''Zoning is a complicated process, and he was definitely a great teacher.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Padeh and others like him acted as intermediaries between property owners -- oftentimes, in Williamsburg and elsewhere, members of Brooklyn's insular Orthodox Jewish communities -- and a worldly new buyer, who might not have money for Richard Meier but still wanted a modernist habitat. Scarano began producing designs to meet this market's demand. ''His architecture attracts the eye, and there is something to be said for how that radiates to the sale side,'' Padeh said. ''When developers saw that, they decided that they wanted to work with Robert.'' By 2004, Scarano was collaborating with the Developers Group's clients on dozens of projects. Over the next few years, he submitted plans for nearly 250 new buildings and many more renovations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the space of just a few years, Scarano's practice more than tripled in size, to 55 architects and design professionals. His business was headquartered on the top floor of a converted warehouse building, flush against the Manhattan Bridge. When the firm outgrew its space, he built an addition on the building's roof, a geometrical riot topped by triangular trusses that were lighted in many colors at night. It was a jaw-dropping sight from the bridge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's an overriding theme in a lot of our work, which I would call this Mondrianic composition in terms of the materials,'' Scarano told me. The 5,000-square-foot addition also functioned as a prominent advertisement for his theories about living large. ''The volume of space and the way people feel in spaces that are more grandiose is quite different, and it affects the psyche,'' Scarano said. ''The idea that the zoning could be used to help create space, interesting spaces, I think was something that wasn't really being explored.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The purpose of zoning is to provide for restrained development. But in Scarano's view, the city's code was a Talmudic document, open to endless avenues of interpretation. Through a variety of arcane strategies, he could literally pull additional real estate out of the air. In the high-ceilinged warehouses of SoHo and TriBeCa, for instance, an earlier generation of gentrifiers had increased their living space by constructing mezzanines, creating the loft look that so many buyers were now after. ''The population of factory buildings was unfortunately being used up,'' Scarano said. ''So what did we do? We created the factory aesthetic in new construction.'' And he didn't just take the aesthetic -- he also adapted the zoning rules that applied to warehouse conversions. Under certain circumstances, the code classified loft mezzanines as storage space, not floor area, and Scarano assured developers their new building plans could slip through this loophole. Effectively, he said, he could fashion double-decker apartments, in buildings that were four stories for legal purposes and eight stories for marketing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That was the line: Go to Bob, he'll get you a bigger building than anyone else,'' says the Brooklyn architect John Hatheway, who helped lead a successful campaign for new height restrictions in his neighborhood, inspired by various projects, including Scarano's. Developers began demanding more from their architects, or else they would just seek an audience with Scarano, who always seemed to find ways to magically enlarge a competitor's plan. ''We would see people lining up, sitting down, waiting in the waiting room to see him,'' said Samy Brahimy, a developer who had been visiting Scarano's office for years. ''It was a little baffling.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few clients delved into the secrets of Scarano's leger/demain. ''I assumed it was some combination of expertise, knowledge of the code and relationships'' at the Department of Buildings, said a developer who, like many other former Scarano clients, asked not to be named because he no longer wants his buildings associated with the architect. ''If people are delivering good things, you don't want to ask questions.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scarano, like many in his voluble profession, has strong opinions about other architects. He appreciates Jean Nouvel for his visionary use of glass; he's not a fan of Meier, whose work, he once said, is characterized by ''a tremendous slavery to Modernism.'' One building that he's particularly fond of is the Porter House, a Meatpacking District renovation, where SHoP Architects added a zinc-paneled four-story addition to an existing Renaissance Revival warehouse. So Scarano said he was excited when, one day in 2005, ''a job walks into my office that's almost a twin of that building.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A developer named Isaac Fischman had acquired a redbrick warehouse on Carroll Street in Brooklyn, a block from the Gowanus Canal. Over the decades, the industrial site was connected to a jute mill, a light-bulb manufacturer and a lunch-cart business, but the brownstone blocks just to the north and west were now some of the most desirable in the city. ''It's historical, it's a three-story building, it has a lot of air rights and potential, and an unusual addition could be put on it,'' Scarano said. ''Well, again, what was a really cool addition to us was not a really cool addition to a lot of other people.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2005, a framework of steel began to go up on top of the warehouse -- and up, and up, until the cubic structure was nearly as tall as the original building. Chris McVoy watched the progress with mounting annoyance from his town house down the block. He thought the warehouse addition was grossly out of proportion, and as an experienced architect himself, he was suspicious. ''I know the floor-area ratios in the neighborhood,'' he said. ''There was no way they could be putting that much area on that site. There was something wrong.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McVoy wasn't the only one who was incredulous. ''It was this monstrous cage on top of a beautiful old manufacturing building,'' Katia Kelly, a community blogger, said. ''And on top of it, the name Scarano.'' The architect's popularity with developers had met with an equal and opposite reaction from Kelly's crowd, which considered him a crass enabler of greed. Complaints about the Carroll Street project soon flooded the buildings department, which briefly halted it. In late 2006, though, construction restarted, and McVoy decided to examine Scarano's plans himself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McVoy quickly identified what he described as several ''pretty glaringly wrong'' floor-area calculations, in part related to mezzanines, and concluded that the building under construction was nearly 8,000 square feet too large. He took his analysis to a buildings-department official. Scarano had come up with a complex justification that involved placing parking on the basement level, but that didn't make sense to McVoy, either. He eventually discovered that Scarano's survey of the existing building made a key misstatement about its dimensions. (Sidebar, right.) ''It's very hard for me to believe that it was an accidental error,'' McVoy said. (Scarano says that the plans were accepted by the buildings department; a spokesman for the department said that happened only after major revisions.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scarano boasted that he knew every nook and cranny of the zoning code, and few thought to question his expertise. He had a genial relationship with the buildings department, and he usually submitted his designs under the city's self-certification program, an honor system instituted to save money during the Giuliani administration. This meant that, in the vast majority of cases, buildings were being constructed with the go-ahead from just one person: Robert Scarano. In neighborhoods all over the city, though, concerned citizens began to throw up obstacles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few, like McVoy, had the specialized knowledge necessary to scrutinize Scarano's fine print. In Manhattan, Kevin Shea, a lawyer specializing in building-code work, grew curious about a new building on the Bowery that he walked by every day -- it just looked too tall. When Shea checked, he discovered that the 16-story Bowery Tower development was being constructed under an allowance for college housing, even though no school was involved with the project. After protesters complained that the tower was clearly meant to be apartments, the project stalled, and it was taken over by new developers, who replaced Scarano, refaced the exterior with traditional brick and opened the chic Bowery Hotel. Scarano takes credit for the acclaimed result.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Even though I was in the industry,'' Shea said, ''it had never occurred to me that you could put up a building in Manhattan without getting an approval of some kind. The further I looked into it, the more crazy it looked.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elsewhere, others were hit with similar realizations, and the opposition came together in a loose-knit network. There was another proposed 16-story tower in Williamsburg, nicknamed ''The Finger,'' because neighbors said that was what Scarano was giving them. There, the architect met zoning requirements by proposing a shared outdoor deck -- on the roof of a neighboring property. The owner, who sued, claimed the architect and developer had conspired to defraud him out of the rights to the space. (Scarano denied wrongdoing, and the case has been settled.) In the neighborhood around Greenwood Cemetery, a graphic designer named Aaron Brashear rallied opposition to a number of Scarano's buildings, including one that would have blocked a hilltop view of the Statue of Liberty. Critics began to question how Scarano was counting his mezzanines as storage, when the spaces were being marketed as bedrooms, sometimes with adjoining baths.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scarano vigorously defended himself, saying he was merely ''pushing the envelope'' of the zoning code's established interpretation. The controversies over his designs made irresistible material for a multiplying chorus of boom-time news organs devoted to real estate. ''Blogs tend to have these heroes and villains,'' said Lockhart Steele, founder of the Web site Curbed, who gleefully cast Scarano in the villainous category. ''It was like this slowly dawning realization, that all these things we found distasteful were all the work of one man.'' Scarano was more than willing to mix it up with opponents. Some received furious ALL CAPS e-mails, others plaintive or ominous phone messages. On the blog Brownstoner, among others, Scarano often posted taunting comments: ''Happy to see that all my good friends and critics from the crazy house are still out there'' and ''Ah, the wild imagination of those who are not in the know. Its [sic] fantastic to read. Get a life!''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scarano made such comments under his own name -- ''who wants to go through life being anonymous?'' he wrote -- but ultimately, his high profile was his undoing. All the complaints and negative press roused the buildings department, which began auditing his projects. Elan Padeh quietly warned his clients that his favored architect had become a liability, and some builders began re-examining their plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2008, Isaac Fischman removed Scarano from the Carroll Street warehouse project, after the buildings department ordered the developer to stop work. For the last three years, Scarano's skeletal addition has loomed over the area, symbolic and unfinished. ''They got greedy,'' McVoy says. ''If they had just renovated in that time and not tried to get around zoning, the irony is they would have been done before the crash.'' Fischman recently announced that all the steel will come back down, and he will convert the building to apartments while maintaining its existing dimensions. Fischman told me he lost ''a serious amount of money'' to Scarano-related delays. ''I was one of his victims,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scarano scoffs at the notion that any developer, Fischman included, was duped into accepting his designs. Architecture ''is not so dissimilar from the accounting profession,'' he said, dropping all Mondrianic pretense. ''When someone goes to their tax accountant . . . they don't tell the fellow to figure out how to not have the most deductions.'' Everyone was happy until the auditors arrived, and then came recriminations. Over the past few years, numerous developers have sued Scarano, claiming he prepared faulty plans, while he has countersued to recover hundreds of thousands in unpaid fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In early 2006, after a meticulous review, the city filed a series of civil charges against Scarano in an administrative court, among other things claiming that he ''made false or misleading statements'' in submissions for 25 self-certified projects. Most of the violations concerned mezzanines. The buildings department had just promulgated new guidelines, holding that if the mezzanines had more than five feet of headroom, they could not count as storage space. A few months after the case was filed, the city settled the charges in return for Scarano's giving up his right to self-certify. ''I believe strongly and until today that my interpretations and my decisions were founded on things that were permissible,'' Scarano says, contending that many of his audited buildings were eventually cleared by examiners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some wonder, if what he was doing was so blatantly illegal, why Scarano met with approval for so long. Robert LiMandri, the commissioner of the buildings department, said he had ''no information that indicates that there was any sort of corruption'' and that no employees were disciplined. Rather, he contended, the department was overwhelmed by a ''frenzy'' of building activity, and it relied on Scarano's representations, which were often voluminous and confusing. At the time, the department had no way to punish him for lying. In 2007, though, state legislators, inspired by complaints about scofflaw architects, passed a law that allowed tough sanctions. ''We really needed this stick to be able to say to people, look, there are no more cat-and-mouse games,'' LiMandri said. The department created a new Special Enforcement Unit, focusing on Scarano as an initial target.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city brought a new prosecution, a complicated case involving adjoining properties and supposed double counting of zoning rights, but then, in late 2008, a seemingly unambiguous bit of trickery dropped into investigators' laps. Scarano was seeking a routine approval for a commercial building, which could not be occupied as long as an electrical pole was sitting in the middle of a new driveway. The architect submitted a curious photo of the building: shot from an off-center angle, it gave the appearance that the driveway was no longer obstructed. When the city sent an inspector to the site, he saw the pole hadn't actually been moved. An excited buildings official e-mailed a colleague: ''It is a smoking peashooter.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At trial, Scarano testified that he tried to get his ''knucklehead'' client to deal with the obstructing pole, and his lawyer called the city's repeated investigations a ''vendetta.'' Last March, though, the judge found that Scarano had engaged in ''deliberate subterfuge'' and actions ''so deceptive that they call to mind out-and-out fraud.'' He was given the maximum punishment -- a total ban on filing any documents with the city. The sanction is currently stayed while Scarano fights it in a state appeals court, but if it's upheld, the architect says he could be put out of business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many architects who know Scarano were mystified. ''He's the guy that they're out to get, and when it comes down to charging him with something, they charge him with such a minor thing,'' said Donald Weston, head of the urban-design committee of the A.I.A.'s Brooklyn chapter. To some, Scarano looks like a scapegoat for the city's inconsistency and winking enforcement. But other architects view his violations as egregious. ''I think you can't legislate aesthetics,'' said Chris McVoy, but he added, ''there's a certain public trust in these regulations whether you agree with them or not.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scarano's firm has been devastated by the scandal and the housing bust. His fabulous office is now occupied by just 20 employees, he said, and even appreciative clients are reluctant to give him business, lest his name attract unwanted scrutiny. But he is hardly the only one who has suffered. Some residents of his lofts, who bought believing a broker's assurance that they were two-bedrooms, have since learned that they count as one-bedrooms for appraisal, while others complain of faulty construction. ''I am only the architect,'' Scarano replies, saying he never had any control over how developers built or marketed his designs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scarano maintains that his reputation will ultimately rest on how his buildings hold up in the eyes of the public and critics. He revels in his inclusion in the A.I.A. Guide: if the mentions weren't always positive, they did prove he mattered. Fran Leadon, the volume's co-author and a City College professor, told me he struggled with how to describe Scarano's unquestionable contributions to the cityscape. ''I felt like it was a challenge to talk of them as being symptomatic of the extreme end of the building boom,'' he said. ''Not caring about history on a certain site, not really caring about the context, but caring very much about maximizing square footage and very much about buildings as commodities.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Visiting Scarano's Brooklyn projects today is like reliving the bubble's deflation in a series of freeze-frame photos. There are completed high-rises along Fourth Avenue and a creamy white building in Bedford-Stuyvesant, where giant windows gave me a glimpse of a Saturday afternoon open house. Other buildings appeared to be ready but empty, or moldering unfinished. On the plywood that fenced in one forlorn Fort Greene construction site, a graffiti artist had spray-painted a frowning face and the word ''Help.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of people got destroyed,'' said Alan Messner, a developer who built three Scarano buildings. Standing on a Williamsburg street corner, admiring the wood-paneled exterior of a condominium building called the Artisan, Messner told me he barely managed to survive after a lengthy buildings-/department audit, which he credited Scarano for working through.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Messner's building looked great, but many other projects managed to pass the review process only after extensive alterations and downsizing. Developers claim that the buildings department imposed its new standards arbitrarily. In some buildings, they were allowed to cut their mezzanines' headroom to five feet by constructing flimsy wood platforms. (When my wife and I visited a Scarano building's open house in 2009, a broker was quick to mention how easily such a platform could be removed.) Elsewhere, inspectors apparently accepted a veneer of plausible deniability. A mezzanine could still be a storage space, it seems, if it didn't have a bathroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hence, a builder might erect a mysterious wall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, in New York, space seldom goes to waste or waits long for rediscovery. Last year, Cody Brown and Kate Ray, recent New York University graduates and partners in a Web start-up, happened to find a rental in a Bushwick building by looking for the keyword ''sunny'' on Craigslist. It was maximalist Scarano: a three-story triplex with a mezzanine and several outdoor terraces. ''It's designed to make yuppies smile,'' Brown told me when I visited recently. Originally conceived by the developer as luxury condos, the building was briefly leased to an ex-con who ran it as a halfway house, but the neighborhood protested, and now Brown and Ray were dividing the triplex with three other roommates, exploiting every bit of space. They were young and thrilled with the rent, and they weren't sweating the details. ''It's like, beautiful things,'' Ray said. ''And then you start pulling the doorknob too hard, and it comes off.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a secret room,'' Brown told me, conspiratorially. Up on the mezzanine level, next to a pair of D.J.'s turntables, he knocked on a wall. It sounded hollow. I recounted the story of the hidden bathroom and left them to consider their options.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Down eight flights of stairs -- no elevator -- I walked past another building resident, a young guy in a hoodie, chatting up some women on the sidewalk. He was going to give a party, he said, and as they walked off, he shouted out how to find it: ''I live in the penthouse!''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHOTOS: All buildings are in Brooklyn: [1] 110 Fourth Avenue [2] 214 Richardson Street [3] 99 Gold Street [4] 406 Lorimer Street [5] 255 Fourth Avenue [6] 78 Ten Eyck Street. (MM68-MM69); 4 EAST THIRD STREET: Scarano's original plan was for a 16-story residential condominium tower. Under zoning regulations in the neighborhood at the time, residential developments were only allowed a floor-area ratio (FAR) of 3.44, while developments with a ''community use'' could have a FAR of 6.5. Scarano and the developer claimed the units were to be college housing, which would allow him to build using the more generous community standard -- at the time a widespread and notorious dodge. Complaints were fi led with the Department of Buildings. The original developer then sold the tower to a group that decided to convert it to the Bowery Hotel, which, as a commercial use, was permitted a more generous FAR. (MM71); 333 CARROLL STREET: Scarano tried to build a two-story addition to the roof of this old warehouse by transferring floor area from the building's lowest level, which he planned to convert to parking, to the top of the roof. But the zoning code distinguished between a basement (which is partly above ground, defined as habitable, and therefore counted toward the floor-area ratio) and a cellar (which is underground and uninhabitable). Opponents accused Scarano of trying to finesse the difference, and eventually the Department of Buildings declared the space a cellar. New height limits have been established in the neighborhood, and the partly built addition is coming down. (MM72); PHOTO (PHOTOGRAPHS BY GABRIELLE PLUCKNETTE FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) (MM73)</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NORTH ATTLEBORO, Mass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN the year 2000, Charles and Alice Sadoski sold their small ranch house, bought a three-bedroom trailer, and moved down the road to the Wamsutta Mobile Home Village, an 86-unit property right behind Wally's Auto Mall. Mr. Sadoski was ailing, and could not keep up the ranch house anymore, but ''he wanted a place that if something happened to him, I would be safe,'' Mrs. Sadoski explained. ''Here, I'm not too far from the bank, and CVS is up the street.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sadoski died last year, at 72, and Mrs. Sadoski, 66, seems to be living the tranquil and secure life her husband sought for her. A retired child-care worker, she spends her days doing volunteer work -- making more than 200 colorful ''coverups,'' or giant bibs, for a nearby adult day-care center, for example. Sometimes she knits in the dark green recliner in her living room; other times she sews at a small desk under a window in her kitchen, where she keeps rows of spooled thread, a sewing machine and a tomato-shaped pincushion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But despite her peaceful life, Mrs. Sadoski has one looming worry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It scares the daylights out of me that some big corporation is going to come in and raise the rent until I can't pay for it anymore,'' she said as she folded a just-completed blue plaid coverup. ''I'm on a very limited income, and I don't know where else I would go.'' It is not the mobile home that Mrs. Sadoski rents; she and her husband bought the trailer, vintage 1962, for $29,900. But, like 25 percent of the roughly 18 million Americans living in one of the nation's 50,000 mobile-home parks, she rents the underlying land, and is thus as vulnerable as any tenant to rent increases or even eviction, if a landlord sells to a developer with other plans for the property. Many of these residences, also called manufactured homes, are fairly large, and to move them might cost several thousand dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To avoid these risks, Mrs. Sadoski and her neighbors set out in 2009 to create a cooperative and purchase the park's land themselves. After a rival buyer bowed out, and after a price drop by the park owner, the residents are now nearing success. They have secured a mortgage, and are scheduled to close the deal in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such purchases are not new. In a few states where property values have historically been high, like California and Florida, mobile-home residents began to form for-profit cooperatives in the 1960s. In New Hampshire in the mid-'80s, a nonprofit model emerged that aims to keep shares inexpensive enough so every resident can join and to reinvest any profits in the property. That model soon spread to Massachusetts, New York and Rhode Island.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But now the movement is expanding. Since 2004, Connecticut, Maine, Minnesota, Montana, Texas and Wisconsin have all welcomed their first nonprofit mobile-home cooperative, and the number of cooperatives has grown as well in the states of Delaware, Oregon and Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recent real estate boom has fueled this surge. ''Manufactured housing communities were routinely being closed down, due to change of use, in the real estate run-up in the mid-2000s,'' said Paul Bradley, president of ROC USA, a nonprofit group that provides assistance to these residents. ''That led to a lot of front-page stories that rattled both homeowners and advocates.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, legislators have lent these buy-minded residents a hand. Since 2005, the states of Montana, North Carolina, Oregon and Washington have set up tax breaks and other incentives for landowners who sell parks to a residents' association or other qualified group. (Vermont, the only other state with such a law, passed its in 1998). Those measures join similarly supportive laws in 12 other states, including new ones in Delaware and New York, that, among other things, require owners of mobile-home parks to notify residents of any impending sale or give them a right of first refusal. Last August George Everett, 64, the former owner of the Green Acres Park in Kalispell, Mont., became the first property owner to sell his mobile-home park to its occupants under that state's new law. ''I hated to see them have to get up and leave if somebody bought the property,'' said Mr. Everett, who received a capital gains tax break for selling to the residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Sinrud, 43, president of the Green Acres residents' group, hopes the sale of the 32-unit park -- which sits deep in the Rockies and is surrounded by mountains on three sides -- will make the homeowners' future more secure. ''We have several individuals that are living paycheck to paycheck,'' he said. ''Our board's goal is to keep costs as low as possible.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bradley said: ''The real big win, in terms of the homeowners, is that that cooperative removes the property from the speculative real estate market. No third party is going to profit off of the land in the short term.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this arrangement may not be for everyone. ''Unless residents decide to hire somebody for on-site management, they are left to do it themselves,'' said Thayer Long, executive vice president of the Manufactured Housing Institute, a trade group. ''That can be a challenge. A lot of folks don't have the experience doing that or just don't want to do it. A lot of residents just want to live in a community, pay rent, and have everything taken care of for them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, one reason that Mrs. Sadoski and her neighbors have nearly succeeded in buying their park is that the rival buyer backed out once he learned how much updating was needed for the park's roads and water, sewage and electrical systems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You can't run a dryer or a modern appliance in some of these lots because some of the park's electrical service is so old,'' said Andy Danforth, the housing program manager at the Cooperative Development Institute, a nonprofit group that is helping the Wamsutta homeowners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Unadilla, N.Y., a town of 5,000 about 100 miles southwest of Albany, the residents of Meadow Valley Manufactured Home Park are confronting these challenges firsthand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The occupants of that 54-unit park bought it at a foreclosure auction in October, and now, said Pat Scheidegger, 68, the secretary of the residents' association, ''There's all these laws we've had to find out about. We're finding new vendors, and finding new things that have to be fixed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Scheidegger, a divorced mother of four, sold her home and moved to Meadow Valley in 1992, after her youngest child graduated from high school. ''I just decided that since I was by myself I didn't need anything that big,'' she said. So she bought a new, three-bedroom, two-bathroom manufactured home for $23,000, and selected a lot on top of the small hill that splits the park into two levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I just love it,'' she said. ''I have a terrific view. And I don't have to look at another house out my back door. I can just see for miles and miles and miles.'' There are thickets of trees on Ms. Scheidegger's horizon, and in the winter a never-ending snowfield that unfolds almost to the alpaca farms that are scattered about the local hills.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Nothing goes on here,'' conceded Ms. Scheidegger, but she likes it that way, she said. During the day, she quilts or makes hook rugs, or does word-search puzzles in one of the books she receives monthly -- a Christmas gift from her dad and sister. Occasionally, she goes to dinner with some fellow residents, often to a nearby restaurant called The Cream of the Crop at the Barn. The featured dish at the Friday night fish fry, she said, ''is such a big piece of fish that it sticks out on both sides of the plate.'' This quiet country life has its downsides for the residents, but owning the land has helped on that score already.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For six years there was an abandoned home, just sitting here, full of rats,'' Ms. Scheidegger said. ''The neighbors on both sides complained to the park manager, and he always said that they were waiting for the courts, waiting for the courts. After we bought the park, we just gave it away to get it out of here. And now we're going to try and rent that lot because that's our only empty lot in the whole park.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Scheidegger also values the park's growing sense of community. One resident's son ''goes around the park on his four-wheeler if there's a lot of snow and just plows anyone who hasn't been plowed out,'' she said, adding, ''He doesn't even want money.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the spring, the residents will plant $100 worth of tulips, daffodils and other perennials, and then, Ms. Scheidegger said, ''We're going to close off one of the streets and have everybody come and have a picnic. We said when we won the auction and bought the place we would have a celebration, but we couldn't then because it was winter.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gaining title to the land is also fostering a new sense of pride. ''Now we're somebody,'' said Terri Aker, 53, a machine operator at a calendar factory. ''We're owners.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for Mrs. Sadoski back in Wamsutta, she eagerly anticipates another fruit of residential ownership: peace of mind. ''Having a corporation would be out of my comfort zone,'' she said. ''I feel like if the residents get the park, then I will be O.K. I'm comfortable with these people. They've been my neighbors a long time.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Producer prices surged in February at their fastest pace in about 18 months, lifted by high food and energy prices, according to a government report on Wednesday that pointed to a buildup in inflation pressures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a second report, the government said housing starts declined the most in 27 years in February while building permits dropped to their lowest level on record, a sign that the beleaguered real estate sector has yet to rebound from its deep slump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department said on Tuesday that its seasonally adjusted index for prices paid at the farm and factory gate jumped 1.6 percent, the largest increase since June 2009, after rising 0.8 percent in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.7 percent increase in producer prices last month. In the 12 months to February, producer prices increased 5.6 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report came a day after the Federal Reserve said it expected the upward inflation pressure from energy and other commodities to prove transitory but that it would keep a close eye on inflation and inflation expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase in wholesale prices last month was broad-based, with energy prices surging 3.3 percent -- the biggest increase since January 2010, after 1.8 percent the previous month. Gasoline prices, which rose 3.7 percent, accounted for over 40 percent of the increase in the energy index. Food prices jumped 3.9 percent, the biggest increase since 1974.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stripping out volatile food and energy costs, core producer prices rose 0.2 percent last month, matching expectations, and retreating from a 0.5 percent rise in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, the core index was lifted by 1.0 percent increase in apparel, which was the biggest rise since 1990, while passenger cars rose 0.6 percent, the Labor Department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 12 months to February, the core Producer Price Index rose 1.8 percent, in line with expectations. It was the largest increase since August 2009 and followed a 1.6 percent increase in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the housing report, the Commerce Department said that groundbreaking on new construction dropped 22.5 percent in February to an annual rate of 479,000 units. This was just above a record low set in April 2009 and way below the estimates of economists, who had been looking for a smaller drop to 570,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">January's figure was revised up to 618,000 units from 596,000. But that did not change the tenor of the report, which confirmed that the sector was failing to recover despite interest rates near record lows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits, a hint of future construction demand, fell to a record low of 517,000 units from a revised 563,000, and were down by about 20 percent from levels seen in February 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One impediment to the sector's recovery is a vast backlog of unsold inventory, while a shaky job market has also made consumers reluctant to embark on any major new financial commitments. A glut of foreclosures, stalled in recent months by revelations of improper loan documentation, is further depressing the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department also reported that the country's current-account deficit narrowed in the fourth quarter, snapping five quarters of gains as export growth outweighed increases in imported goods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deficit, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments in and out of the United States, shrank to $113.3 billion -- or 3.1 percent of gross domestic product -- in the last quarter of 2010. That was down from a revised third-quarter deficit of $125.5 billion, and the lowest since the first quarter of 2010.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're in the market for a home, you may want to consider some advice from academics before sealing the deal. Research papers on the topic of negotiation offer numerous tips to help potential real estate buyers better navigate the process, as I recently learned when I wrote a paper for my business school negotiation class on the subject. This post is part of a series on some of the findings that I thought were worth sharing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It may be common sense to keep your lips sealed if a real estate agent ever asks you what the most is you'll pay for a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if you ever wanted proof that this is a good idea, the findings in a 1992 paper, "Agents as Information Brokers: The Effects of Information Disclosure on Negotiated Outcomes," published in Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, highlight why it's important for buyers to keep their reservation prices to themselves and not reveal them in any way to a seller's agent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a study simulating a real estate transaction where all communication between the buyer and seller is passed through an agent negotiating the sale of the house, the researchers found that "agent knowledge of reservation price affects the settlement price, the commission garnered by the agent and the amount of benefit or surplus gained by both principals in the negotiation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More specifically, the researchers found that the final price "was significantly higher" when the agent knew the buyer's reservation price and it was lowest when only the seller's reservation price was known.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why? The thinking is that a seller's agent who only knows one reservation price uses it as an anchor for what the final price should be, while a seller's agent who knows both reservation prices aligns with the seller in an effort to garner a high sales price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the researchers write in the paper, "The findings suggest it is generally unwise for buyers to release information about their bottom line to an agent whose compensation is based on a percentage of sales price."</p>

</div><div class="author">By CASEY B. MULLIGAN   </div><div>686 words</div><div>16 March 2011</div><div>NYT Blogs</div><div>NYTB</div><div>English</div><div>© 2011 The New York Times Company. All rights reserved   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Casey B. Mulligan is an economics professor at the University of Chicago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate's future can often be understood by closely watching the supply of residential and commercial buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In early 2009, employment and gross domestic product were dropping sharply, and real estate values had plummeted from their highs in 2006. The housing market was already in crisis, so it felt right to expect the commercial real estate market to follow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nouriel Roubini predicted, "More than 700 banks could fail as a result of their exposure to commercial real estate." Elizabeth Warren later reported, "There is a commercial real estate crisis on the horizon."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And journalists frequently referred to a looming commercial real estate crisis.But none of this commentary noted how the supply situation in commercial real estate was drastically different than it was in housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By 2008, it was clear that too many homes were built for the market to bear. But the four-to-five-year boom in housing construction had taken resources away from commercial building, holding down the inventory of structures that would be available for business use.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With commercial structures in relatively short supply, I concluded in early 2009 that there would probably not be a commercial real estate crisis creating waves of bank failures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My conclusion was greeted with much skepticism (one example was Salon's article on "The NYT's Chicago Economist: Wrong Again," insisting that warning of a commercial real estate meltdown was part of "reliable economy-watching"). Paul Krugman also weighed in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than two years have passed, and we no longer hear much about the once-imminent crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Professor Roubini still thinks that a commercial real estate crisis is ahead. Others said the crisis was averted. Either way, it is now recognized that the relatively low supply of commercial real estate made a big difference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In order to assess the likelihood that the housing sector double dips - that is, has another crisis something like the one in 2008 - it helps to look at the supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The black line in the chart below shows an index of housing inventory per person at the end of each year from 1990 to 2011 (with housing inventory measured as square footage, adjusted for quality; 2011 is a forecast). Housing supply almost always increases faster than population, but the housing boom of 2002-6 stood out compared with the other years in terms of the relative rate of housing construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By 2007, housing supply was well above the trend of the 1990s (before the housing boom). If you think that a rational market would have more or less followed that 1990s trend, then the excess supply in 2007 meant that housing prices had to come down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, housing prices did come down a lot in 2007 and 2008, and the housing supply stopped growing. By the end of 2010 - the second-to-last observation shown in the chart - housing supply had fully returned to the trend of the 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the pace of housing construction continues to be slow, it looks as if housing supply will be significantly below trend by the end of this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These supply results tell us something about the future of housing prices. Those prices depend on demand, too, but as long as housing demand is near or above the preboom trend, it looks as though housing prices are low enough already.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the inventories of housing and commercial property sit vacant, but those vacancies are largely part of a slow economic recovery and the difficult task of dividing property losses from previous years among homeowners, landlords, banks and commercial tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the slow pace of new construction, neither the housing nor commercial real estate markets can any longer be characterized as having supply that significantly exceeds the fundamentals of demand.</p>

</div><div class="author">By VIVIAN MARINO   </div><div>872 words</div><div>13 March 2011</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>9</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Maidman, 77, is the chairman of the Townhouse Management Company, which develops and manages residential and mixed-use property in the New York area, as well as operates the private real estate investment trust Amsterdam Realty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is also a lawyer in the law firm Maidman and Mittelman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Do you identify more as a lawyer or as a developer?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A I identify myself more as an attorney. I went to law school, became a lawyer and worked a number of years. I wrote an article for The Yale Law Journal the year after I graduated -- on a proxy fight I won in the late '50s-- and I think it's still a record for a graduate having the soonest signed article in the journal. My first job was at Saxe, Bacon &amp; O'Shea with Roy Cohn, and I assisted him for three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q How did you become involved in real estate?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A My father, William Maidman, was in the real estate business. He developed his business while he was a successful manufacturer of ladies' dresses -- he made dresses for Eleanor Roosevelt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Do you consider yourself now a steward of his business?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Yes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q How do your duties differ from those of your son Mitchel, Townhouse Management's president?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A My son is the active manager -- he is dynamic. And I'm here to give strategy, to consult and to give direction. I'm available to deal with problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Your daughter has been described as pretty dynamic, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A My daughter, Dagny Maidman, was named by Barron's as the sixth top female wealth manager. Everyone in my family is either a doctor, a lawyer or has an M.B.A.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q What are some of Townhouse Management's recent projects?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A My son spearheaded the development of two large buildings with Marriott -- the Chelsea and the Aurora.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q What's happening with your property on East 63rd Street?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A I own 35 and 37 East 63rd, and I acquired 39, just in case 35 and 37 didn't sell as a town house, and they didn't. The market went down at the wrong time. So now we have a 60-odd-foot rental building. We're selling the lower level to the Garden House School. It's all built and ready for them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q How many rental units will there be?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A It's fluctuating. We're just finishing one apartment; somebody's moving in in about two months. And then the duplex, or triplex, that will rent for $150,000 to $200,000, that is being configured. They're being rented with an option to buy if it's ever a condo or co-op.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Is luxury your specialty?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A I wouldn't say that. We do have maybe 1,000 apartments in New York -- in Upper Manhattan and the Bronx -- that are far from luxury. When I first bought a building on 82nd Street in Yorkville, it was not even a middle-class area in many respects. But we've seen all of Manhattan --including the West Side, which was a jungle -- becoming better. So we're hopeful that as Manhattan is filled up, other areas will grow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Speaking of distressed opportunities, your company has been involved in deals to buy nonperforming mortgage notes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A I just did one -- it's in the Bronx -- and we're negotiating several others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If we acquire a mortgage, we're willing to work with the old owner as long as we end up with a reasonable return on our money. We've gone through enough difficulty in the ups and the downs not to want to take away people's property. There are good people in the real estate business and there are -- let's say -- difficult people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q You've been involved in some squabbles yourself -- one with the Durst family 10 years ago, involving property it wanted to buy from you in Times Square.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A The transaction on 42nd Street was my most significant transaction, and it was well recorded. I really was reluctant to sell for such a low price, but after 9/11 it just didn't make sense to hold onto it. Today I'm on friendly terms with the Durst family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Tell me about your Richard Meier home in Sands Point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A This is our weekend home. It also has two structures -- a carriage house and a boat house -- that he designed. It's on the water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Did your wife Gail, a professional interior decorator, work on the inside of the house?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Oh no, Richard Meier decorated my home. All the furniture -- everything -- Richard Meier picked out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And I have the only Richard Meier house with colors. Why do I have colors? Richard said, ''I don't do colors.'' I said, O.K., you don't do colors, then do different shades of white. He thought for a while, and said, I'll do colors. So he gave me colors.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE ''A'' in A.C. Lawrence &amp; Company stands for Anthony, as in Anthony DeGrotta, who co-founded this upstart real estate firm in 2006. The ''C'' doesn't stand for anything -- Mr. DeGrotta and his partner, Larry Friedman, just thought it sounded good. ''Lawrence'' is for Mr. Friedman, even though his name isn't Lawrence; it really is just Larry. The overall effect that the now-35-year-old co-founders were striving for is a name that suggests experience, longevity and venerability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We wanted the firm to sound like something that passed down through the generations, started by Grandpa,'' Mr. DeGrotta said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Something must be working in the name or otherwise, because in less than five years, A. C. Lawrence has grown from five agents in a tiny Chelsea office to more than 100 in swankier Midtown digs on East 45th Street. The founders say the company stands out for its attention to training and low agent-to-manager ratio of seven or eight to one, and for its transparency. ''There are no pocket listings within our company,'' Mr. DeGrotta said. ''If an agent knows of a listing, they don't keep it to themselves'' for competitive advantage. ''They put it into our proprietary data base.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firm's expansion -- which took place during the rockiest property market in decades -- raises an interesting question: Could we be heading toward an era of the little firm in New York real estate?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Big firms like <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span> and Prudential Douglas Elliman, with thousands of agents, still dominate the market, of course. (Elliman says it sells 33 homes a day.) But whether the clout of little firms is growing is an important question for buyers and sellers, as they decide between a highly visible name with vast listings and resources, and a smaller firm that promises to shower the client with individual attention, in many cases focusing on a particular segment of the market, like new downtown condos, prewar Classic 6's or East Side brownstones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in 2005, none other than Barbara Corcoran, the queen of big firms who built the multibillion-dollar <span class="companylink">Corcoran Group</span> from a $1,000 (borrowed) investment, declared in a Business Week interview, ''I think the future belongs to small brokers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She acknowledged that not many people held that view but went on to argue that while the big firms were richer and had more resources, the little ones were more creative and nimbler, having far less bureaucracy and layers of management. ''We need to be responsive to a changing market,'' Ms. Corcoran said. ''And more often than not, the little guy can move. The big guy is still thinking about it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reached last week, Ms. Corcoran, who sold her firm in 2001, stood by her pronouncement. ''Definitely,'' she said. ''On the Internet everyone is equal. The small agent can look as classy as the big agent.'' She added, ''Ten years ago, if you wanted your property noticed you were far better off with large brokerage firms because they were the big buyers on the print ads. That's out the window now.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shaun Osher, a top-producing broker at Douglas Elliman who left in 2005 to start his own firm, CORE, relies heavily on social media to get his firm's name into the public eye, sometimes in subtle ways. Mr. Osher has a blog, COREtalks.com, where he sometimes muses on matters that range far afield from real estate. Last month, for example, he posted a video interview he had done with the designer Nicole Miller during New York Fashion Week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The conversation touched only tangentially on real estate -- but the interview went out on Twitter to all Ms. Miller's followers (as well as, of course, Mr. Osher's), and was picked up by numerous fashion blogs and other sites outside of the real estate realm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Osher has also taken advantage of reality television, taking part in the HGTV reality show ''Selling New York.'' CORE, which started with four people, has grown to 50 agents and 16 staff members. The company focuses on new residential developments, many in downtown Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the main things that any small business -- whether an independent bookstore, a corner toy store or a neighborhood hardware store -- would have customers believe is that service is better and personal attention greater at a little firm. Whether that is true in real estate depends -- because the company name may be ubiquitous, but the client's relationship is usually with a single person.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, Solomon Asser, the principal of the Tecny Group, a design-and-build firm, who would probably get a high level of service no matter where he went, said he thought there could be advantages to smaller firms like Leslie J. Garfield &amp; Company, which currently has two of his listings, including a $26 million Upper East Side town house. ''Dealing with a smaller firm goes with faster answers to things, quicker resolution to things,'' Mr. Asser said. ''You don't need to get an answer from someone else to get something done.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inexperienced players can find smaller brokers less intimidating. When Kelly Snyder and her fiance, Darien Ward, began hunting for their first home, they had trouble reaching the Elliman broker they were dealing with in Harlem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was like pulling teeth trying to get in touch with him,'' Ms. Snyder recalled. She wondered if their age -- she is 27, he is 32 -- and price range had anything to do with it. She recalled thinking: ''We're not looking for a multimillion-dollar place. Are they slighting us because we won't fill their wallet?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was really, really frustrating,'' Ms. Snyder said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then she saw some properties posted on Craigslist by Jennifer Ferland, an agent at A. C. Lawrence, and contacted her. ''From the beginning she was a dream,'' Ms. Snyder said. ''She understood the process and how daunting it can be. She said: 'Let's go through this together. I'm here for you.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end, with Ms. Ferland's guidance, they found a condo in Jersey City that they loved and, at around $300,000, was in their price range. They closed last fall and have been living there happily since.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Snyder says she doesn't know if it was Ms. Ferland's personality and work ethic that made her so effective or if it was that she worked for a smaller firm, but she suspects that size did have something to do with it. ''I think when you have a huge corporation,'' she said, ''it just ends up being so micromanaged that you lose that sense of friendliness.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dottie Herman, the president of Prudential Douglas Elliman, says that no matter the size of the firm, there will always be clients who have issues with individual agents. But she stresses that the personal attention that people expect from small agencies is also part of the Elliman culture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're very hands on,'' Ms. Herman said. She posts her e-mail address on the firm's Web site and when she gets messages, she said, ''I will respond to every single one of them.'' If properties have problems, she said, she herself visits them. The money the firm spends on technology, marketing and research overpowers anything smaller firms can offer, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pamela Liebman, the president of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, expressed similar sentiments. ''We got to be big because we were very good,'' she said, ''and we grew based on the fact that we were so successful.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Liebman says Corcoran has the resources to provide an in-house research department that assists agents, a training center and a 40-person tech department. The result, she said, is a Web site that receives four million hits a day, as well as innovations like Corcoran apps for the iPhone and Android. All that, she said, leads to better and more thorough service for clients. ''Bigger does not mean less service,'' she said. ''To me, bigger should mean better service because we have more resources behind us.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For all the small-firm talk about how technology has leveled the playing field, it can still present high hurdles. A few months ago, Michael Bolla gave up his independent brokerage, Luxury Lofts &amp; Homes, to join Prudential Douglas Elliman because he was about to handle some large developments and was not willing to invest the money to upgrade the servers for his Web site to handle the increased volume in his listings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you have a 120-unit development on a small guy's Web site,'' Mr. Bolla said, ''it will crash.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many smaller firms say specialization is the key to success. Since its founding in 1988, D.G. Neary Realty has trained its sights on downtown Manhattan, specifically Chelsea and the West Village. The firm still has just one office -- on the second floor of a building at 16th Street and Sixth Avenue. Though it now has agents posted elsewhere, including Harlem and the Upper West Side, downtown is the company's stronghold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Real estate is a referral business to a large extent,'' said Gil Neary, the founder. ''If you have a reputation in a neighborhood, people see you and hear you and know you're around and you're available.'' The focus, he said, means that his firm knows ''the nuances of the neighborhood'' -- like the preferences of certain co-op boards, the finances of specific buildings, and the best grocery and barber.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not that other brokers don't have that information,'' Mr. Neary said. ''But I think you have a certain amount of credibility by virtue of familiarity.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tami Hausman, a client of Mr. Neary's, said that local expertise had proved valuable when she and her husband, James Crispino, were looking for a two-bedroom apartment in the Village. ''It was especially important when we saw the apartment we are now in contract for,'' she said. ''Before we stepped in, I remember him saying to us, 'If I was going to buy an apartment in the building, this is the line I would buy in.'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He knew a lot about the history,'' Ms. Hausman continued, ''the kind of people who lived there, where it was in the building, that it was a stable building. Those are the kinds of questions you might ask later.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jed Garfield, the managing partner of Leslie J. Garfield &amp; Company, the nine-broker firm that his father, Leslie, started in 1972, said 95 percent of his firm's business was town houses. The company does business only in Manhattan, having embarked upon what Mr. Garfield describes as a ''very unsuccessful foray'' into Park Slope a few years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To underscore his firm's ''single-minded focus on one type of asset,'' he publishes a quarterly newsletter about town houses that he mails to every town-house owner in Manhattan. Sure, there have been temptations to branch out into co-ops and condos. But, Mr. Garfield said, ''I felt, rightly or wrongly, that it would dilute the brand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If we can't do one thing hopefully a little better than anyone else or know the market better, then what are we worth?''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AT last, the hunt was over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After months of having her hopes dashed as swiftly as they were raised, viewing nearly 40 apartments and cycling through three different brokers, Deborah Herman finally found the perfect New York City home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The moment she stepped into the two-bedroom apartment at 59th Street and First Avenue, with its oversized windows and sweeping views of the Queensboro Bridge, she just knew.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We made an offer, and we got it,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was in August. But it was only in February, nearly six months later, that she finally closed on the $1.15 million apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the intervening months, as she battled through a computer glitch and reams of documentation, Ms. Herman underwent a crash course in the complexities of navigating the mortgage market -- which itself continues to undergo profound change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dread of not finding a lender after the market collapsed in 2009 has been replaced by uncertainty, confusion and frustration. According to brokers and lenders, the list of demands that stand between finding a place to buy and signing on the dotted line simply never stops morphing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Changes proposed by the Obama administration to limit the role of the federal government in the mortgage market could further alter the rules of the road, for borrowers and lenders alike.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York City, there is particular concern about the federal government's lowering the limit on the loans it will buy through the <span class="companylink">Federal National Mortgage Association</span>, known as <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, and the other housing finance giant, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower-income buyers could also be affected as the federal government seeks to limit the size of loans eligible to be bought by the Federal Housing Administration and Department of Veterans Affairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And let's not forget the federal government's proposal to eliminate the mortgage interest tax deduction for high-income earners; the changes in the way brokers will be compensated because of new regulations; and the fact that banks -- despite recent profits -- are still leery of lending. Taken together, all these elements create a situation that can paralyze potential buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Confusion and uncertainty can have the same impact as fear, unfortunately,'' said David S. Marinoff, a mortgage broker and managing director of the Guard Hill Financial Corporation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel and a market analyst for Prudential Douglas Elliman, said that even though affordability was at an all-time high, the usual equation involving interest rates, housing prices and personal income was almost irrelevant, if shoppers were unable to get mortgages to buy properties now tantalizingly within reach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private banks have swung too far in overcorrecting for the excesses of the credit boom from 2003 to 2008, he said, and are actively looking for ways not to lend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Housing does not truly recover until lending does,'' Mr. Miller said. ''It is currently dysfunctional.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the moment, the federal government, through Fannie and Freddie, is supporting about 90 percent of new mortgage loans, because banks are reluctant to make loans without government guarantees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently, Fannie will buy loans of up to $729,750.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September that limit will fall to $625,500 if no action is taken by Congress. Considering that the average Manhattan apartment in the last quarter of 2010 sold for $845,000, according to Mr. Miller, the change could affect a wide swath of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, even if a buyer put 20 percent down -- which would be $169,000 for the $845,000 home -- the total loan needed, $676,000, would still be above the new limit. The buyer would have to come up with $50,500 more to avoid paying the likely higher interest rates that a lender would charge on a ''jumbo'' mortgage, assuming that the buyer could qualify for a loan at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet many politicians have been calling for the federal government to lessen the role it plays in the mortgage market, even if the first steps prove painful. There are also plans, several years down the road, for ending <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> altogether.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the credit crisis in 2008, the limit on loans that Fannie would buy was $417,000. But when private lending all but disappeared and the government seized control of Fannie, the agency raised the limit of loans it would buy to $729,750 in more expensive cities like New York, Boston and San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks simply weren't lending at that time, Mr. Marinoff said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate brokers and private mortgage lenders say that although 2010 was not as bleak as 2009, tighter credit has affected nearly every sector of the market in New York City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For lower-income families, mainly outside Manhattan, the collapse in subprime lending to borrowers with a problematic credit history or low incomes has led to a boom in the number of loans backed by the F.H.A. and Veterans Affairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2005, fewer than 1 percent of all the loans issued in the city were backed by these agencies. In 2009, 16 percent of loans in the city were made possible by these federal programs, according to a recent report by the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But another change being proposed by the Obama administration -- shrinking the size of loans eligible to be bought by the F.H.A. and V.A. -- could mean that less affluent buyers would need to come up with larger down payments as well. The government also said it would raise fees on F.H.A. borrowers for the third straight year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reasons for all the proposed changes are well chronicled, since it was easy credit and lax oversight that led to the bubble to begin with. And there has been bipartisan agreement that the role of the government needs to be scaled back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sarah Gerecke, the executive director of the Furman Center, says changes that bolster the confidence of borrowers and lenders will be a positive step.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But others worry about the effect that all the changes will have on a still-fragile market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Borrowers and developers in New York City will also be facing new hurdles resulting from two regulations that Fannie put in place starting March 1. In the first, if a buyer wants to get a federally backed loan for an apartment in a new condominium conversion, Fannie is requiring that the property be inspected to determine how much cash the condo board needs to keep in reserve for capital improvements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Especially for older buildings, the rule could require that developers keep more than 20 percent of their annual budget in reserve -- much more than the current norm of 10 percent for condos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One result, according to Orest Tomaselli, the chief executive of National Condo Advisors, an independent advisory group, could be higher maintenance fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Co-ops are not covered under the new regulation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other new regulation declared that <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> would not issue loans to people buying into converted condominium buildings in which more than 30 percent of the units remained rent-stabilized, unless the project had been previously approved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These changes, taken together with lower limits on the loans Fannie will issue, could severely affect what is still a halting recovery, Mr. Tomaselli said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond the new rules and regulations, even those who qualify for a loan can be flummoxed by the process of getting from preapproval to closing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Herman, who bought the apartment overlooking the Queensboro Bridge, said she had been armed with $440,000 in cash in the bank and tax returns from the previous three years showing an annual income of $700,000 to $1.1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weeks turned to months as Ms. Herman, who owns a linen supply company, awaited final approval on the loan. And every 30 days she was required to update all the financial information she had turned over to the bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, at some point during her wait, a glitch surfaced in the electronic transfer of her mortgage payment for her Florida home, making it seem as if she had missed a payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her credit score fell to 670 from 740, and the deal almost collapsed. Only after another flurry of letters, a phone call from her lender in Florida to the prospective lender in New York, and another three-week delay, did the matter get resolved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She had always planned to put 20 percent down, but as the deal drew closer, she was told by the New York lender that the only way she would get the seven-year adjustable-rate mortgage at 3.5 percent was to put 38 percent down, bringing the amount below the $729,750 ceiling for a federally guaranteed loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Fortunately,'' she said, ''I had the money.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Around 200 parishioners were gathered on a recent Sunday for the 10 a.m. Mass at St. Cecilia's Roman Catholic Church in Greenpoint, a grand limestone pile a block from the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The bare minimum is for others to do, not for us,'' the pastor, the Rev. James Krische, 52, preached from the pulpit. ''Jesus calls us to leap beyond the minimum.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">St. Cecilia's has more than heeded its pastor's call. Since 2009, the parish has bridged the cultures of old and new Greenpoint by hosting an arts program in buildings that once served as the hub of a booming Irish community but had lately had little reason to turn on their lights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That Sunday, while the pastor was delivering his sermon, there were artists at work in the former school building; an art show in a convent building turned gallery; a photo shoot in the former residence for the Christian Brothers, members of the religious order who, with nuns, staffed the school; and two film crews setting up in the school's basement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The arrangement is keeping St. Cecilia's vibrant at a time when the city is littered with underused or empty church buildings, and there have been few original ideas to put them to good use. Instead of falling victim to vandalism and decay, St. Cecilia's buildings have been emerging as a haven for space-starved artists, in a part of Brooklyn that is increasingly young and creative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When ''Father Jim'' arrived in early 2008, he found the parish in a condition that has become all too familiar in New York: in debt, the school facing declining enrollment and little money to spend on maintenance of the empty convent and the brothers' residence. The church itself, built in 1891 for a mostly Irish congregation, was still drawing 300 parishioners every weekend, far from its 800-seat capacity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All over the city, other churches and parishes have faced similar challenges: high upkeep costs, a declining number of parishioners and a shortage of the priests and nuns who minister to them. Late last year, the Brooklyn Diocese began considering closing down or merging some of its 198 parishes. The Archdiocese of New York has already closed 10 churches and merged 11 others with neighboring parishes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The demographics of many of these neighborhoods have shifted,'' said David Noonan, with the real estate company Newmark Knight Frank, who has assisted the Brooklyn Diocese and other religious groups in evaluating their property options.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They have to think about how do they support their mission and do what's consistent with their principles and right for their community.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At St. Cecilia's, the decision had been made by spring 2008 to close its school. At the time, condominium buildings were springing up like glassy weeds all over Greenpoint and Williamsburg, and the diocese began marketing the school, schoolyard and other empty buildings to developers. But then the real estate market crashed, and that slice of the St. Cecilia property was no longer attractive. The pastor began thinking about a Plan B, and about the artists flooding into the neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Father Jim wanted art to be part of the raw space,'' said Daniel Navetta, a location scout and founder of ApK Media, who has shot more than 50 projects at St. Cecilia's. ''And he wanted musicians around because St. Cecilia is the patron saint of music and because he wanted people who could infuse energy into the spaces.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The arts program evolved almost accidentally. People who worked on film shoots there in late 2008 began telling friends about the Greenpoint parish with the amazing buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then a parishioner who works in real estate told band members looking for rehearsal space that they should talk to her priest; another parishioner told one of her tenants, an artist looking for a site for a show, to do the same.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pastor said yes in both cases, and soon more people showed up with ideas and requests. After putting some ground rules into effect -- all art shows must end by 11 p.m., the thermostat would be set at 50, the artists would give donations for use of the space -- the pastor kept saying yes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's like a weird commune or something that nobody ever intended to exist,'' said Nathan Spondike, the artist whose landlady referred him to her priest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over Labor Day weekend in 2009, Mr. Spondike organized the first large exhibit at the convent-turned-gallery, a group show with 30 artists, 2 bands playing and throngs of the young and the hip descending on St. Cecilia's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shortly after, Mr. Spondike and some of the other artists from that show asked if they could look around the empty school, five floors of classrooms with 16-foot high ceilings, some with views of the Manhattan skyline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within weeks, all of the 36 classrooms that the pastor made available for studios were claimed by painters, sculptors, a dressmaker and a choreographer. (There are now 93 artists on a waiting list.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three bands use the school's basement for rehearsal space. And out back, the former schoolyard is home to the Tenth Acre Farm, a dozen above-ground planters full of organic eggplants, tomatoes and other vegetables. That is all in addition to the 10 or so film or video shoots each week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The parish property's various buildings have been host to feature films like ''Brooklyn's Finest,'' television shows like ''30 Rock'' and ''Rescue Me,'' and hundreds of smaller productions. The pastor charges on a sliding scale, but even for the bigger budget commercial productions, it ends up being less expensive than elsewhere, with the added benefit of less red tape and a multitude of options.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not only the filmmakers benefit. While the artists give donations for their studio spaces and shows, the commercial film and video shoots are what pay for the upkeep and maintenance of the buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All this activity has led to occasional complaints, particularly about production crews' taking up too much on-street parking space, but they have been few.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Some people didn't understand it,'' said Rosalie Washack, a lifelong parishioner and neighborhood resident. But, she added, ''It's being Christian: You extend the hand and bring the church into the community.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the school's closing still stings, parishioners view the arts program as a way to keep their church relevant and open.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What Father Jim has done here is open up the doors to the new people who have moved into the community,'' said Francis Brancato, another lifelong parishioner and second-generation product of St. Cecilia's school. ''And they're not all going to come to church, but maybe a few of them will. And in the meantime, it's brought life back to those buildings and to this block.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the moving parts have multiplied, the pastor, who is the sole clergyman, has absorbed the additional work, keeping track of everything in a collection of bulging binders and overflowing calendars in his office in the rectory. Not that there are not occasional hiccups. That Sunday morning, a film crew had mistakenly set up in a room the pastor had reserved for a Sunday school class. He straightened it out before Mass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The artists seem to take some pleasure in their chapter of the church's long history of artistic patronage. And though that relationship has historically been a complicated one, at St. Cecilia the pastor has remained hands off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''His attitude is that he's providing the platform and the space for the work to happen,'' said Celia Rowlson-Hall, a dancer, choreographer and filmmaker who occupies a cavernous studio on the school's fifth floor, ''and he's never said 'This certain kind of work' needs to happen.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Washack, who attends many of the gallery shows, said the parishioners sometimes ''stick out like a sore thumb.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've seen some art shows in there that I've cringed a little at,'' she added, ''but they've been so nice and so grateful, and the energy in there has been so positive.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The future of the arts program, and the parish itself, is unclear. Though the program could most likely continue even if the pastor moved on to another posting, a real estate deal could end it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Rowlson-Hall said, ''I do wonder, are we sitting on something that could be possibly the next PS1?'' referring to the MoMA-affiliated art space that occupies a former school in Queens. She added, ''I would just hope that all this creative energy that's in this place continues.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FOR more than a decade, the American real estate market resembled an overstuffed novel, which is to say, it was an engrossing piece of fiction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage brokers hip deep in profits handed out no-doc mortgages to people with fictional incomes. Wall Street shopped bundles of those loans to investors, no matter how unappetizing the details. And federal regulators gave sleepy nods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That world largely collapsed under the weight of its improbabilities in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a piece of that world survives on Library Street in Reston, Va., where an obscure business, the MERS Corporation, claims to hold title to roughly half of all the home mortgages in the nation -- an astonishing 60 million loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Never heard of MERS? That's fine with the mortgage banking industry--as MERS is starting to overheat and sputter. If its many detractors are correct, this private corporation, with a full-time staff of fewer than 50 employees, could turn out to be a very public problem for the mortgage industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Judges, lawmakers, lawyers and housing experts are raising piercing questions about MERS, which stands for Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, whose private mortgage registry has all but replaced the nation's public land ownership records. Most questions boil down to this:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How can MERS claim title to those mortgages, and foreclose on homeowners, when it has not invested a dollar in a single loan?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, more fundamentally: Given the evidence that many banks have cut corners and made colossal foreclosure mistakes, does anyone know who owns what or owes what to whom anymore?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answers have implications for all American homeowners, but particularly the millions struggling to save their homes from foreclosure. How the MERS story plays out could deal another blow to an ailing real estate market, even as the spring buying season gets under way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MERS has distanced itself from the dubious behavior of some of its members, and the company itself has not been accused of wrongdoing. But the legal challenges to MERS, its practices and its records are mounting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Arkansas Supreme Court ruled last year that MERS could no longer file foreclosure proceedings there, because it does not actually make or service any loans. Last month in Utah, a local judge made the no-less-striking decision to let a homeowner rip up his mortgage and walk away debt-free. MERS had claimed ownership of the mortgage, but the judge did not recognize its legal standing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The state court is attracted like a moth to the flame to the legal owner, and that isn't MERS,'' says Walter T. Keane, the Salt Lake City lawyer who represented the homeowner in that case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, on Long Island, a federal bankruptcy judge ruled in February that MERS could no longer act as an ''agent'' for the owners of mortgage notes. He acknowledged that his decision could erode the foundation of the mortgage business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this, Judge Robert E Grossman said, was not his fault.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This court does not accept the argument that because MERS may be involved with 50 percent of all residential mortgages in the country,'' he wrote, ''that is reason enough for this court to turn a blind eye to the fact that this process does not comply with the law.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With MERS under scrutiny, its chief executive, R. K. Arnold, who had been with the company since its founding in 1995, resigned earlier this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A BIRTH certificate, a marriage license, a death certificate: these public documents note many life milestones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For generations of Americans, public mortgage documents, often logged in longhand down at the county records office, provided a clear indication of homeownership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But by the 1990s, the centuries-old system of land records was showing its age. Many county clerk's offices looked like something out of Dickens, with mortgage papers stacked high. Some clerks had fallen two years behind in recording mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a mortgage banking industry in a hurry, this represented money lost. Most banks no longer hold onto mortgages until loans are paid off. Instead, they sell the loans to Wall Street, which bundles them into investments through a process known as securitization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MERS, industry executives hoped, would pull record-keeping into the Internet age, even as it privatized it. Streamlining record-keeping, the banks argued, would make mortgages more affordable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for the mortgage industry, MERS was mostly about speed -- and profits. MERS, founded 16 years ago by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> and big banks like <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> and <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span>, cut out the county clerks and became the owner of record, no matter how many times loans were transferred. MERS appears to sell loans to MERS ad infinitum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This high-speed system made securitization easier and cheaper. But critics say the MERS system made it far more difficult for homeowners to contest foreclosures, as ownership was harder to ascertain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MERS was flawed at conception, those critics say. The bankers who midwifed its birth hired <span class="companylink">Covington &amp; Burling</span>, a prominent Washington law firm, to research their proposal. Covington produced a memo that offered assurances that MERS could operate legally nationwide. No one, however, conducted a state-by-state study of real estate laws.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They didn't do the deep homework,'' said an official involved in those discussions who spoke on condition of anonymity because he has clients involved with MERS. ''So as far as anyone can tell their real theory was: 'If we can get everyone on board, no judge will want to upend something that is reasonable and sensible and would screw up 70 percent of loans.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">County officials appealed to Congress, arguing that MERS was of dubious legality. But this was the 1990s, an era of deregulation, and the mortgage industry won.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We lost our revenue stream, and Americans lost the ability to immediately know who owned a piece of property,'' said Mark Monacelli, the St. Louis County recorder in Duluth, Minn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And so MERS took off. Its board gave its senior vice president, William Hultman, the rather extraordinary power to deputize an unlimited number of ''vice presidents'' and ''assistant secretaries'' drawn from the ranks of the mortgage industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ''nomination'' process was near instantaneous. A bank entered a name into MERS's Web site, and, in a blink, MERS produced a ''certifying resolution,'' signed by Mr. Hultman. The corporate seal was available to those deputies for $25.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As personnel policies go, this was a touch loose. Precisely how loose became clear when a lawyer questioned Mr. Hultman in April 2010 in a lawsuit related to its foreclosure against an Atlantic City cab driver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How many vice presidents and assistant secretaries have you appointed? the lawyer asked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't know that number,'' Mr. Hultman replied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Approximately?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I wouldn't even be able to tell you, right now.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the thousands?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Yes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each of those deputies could file loan transfers and foreclosures in MERS's name. The goal, as with almost everything about the mortgage business at that time, was speed. Speed meant money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ALAN GRAYSON has seen MERS's record-keeping up close. From 2009 until this year, he served as the United States representative for Florida's Eighth Congressional District -- in the Orlando area, which was ravaged by foreclosures. Thousands of constituents poured through his office, hoping to fend off foreclosures. Almost all had papers bearing the MERS name.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In many foreclosures, the MERS paperwork was squirrelly,'' Mr. Grayson said. With no real legal authority, he says, Fannie and the banks eliminated the old system and replaced it with a privatized one that was unreliable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokeswoman for MERS declined interview requests. In an e-mail, she noted that several state courts have ruled in MERS's favor of late. She expressed confidence that MERS's policies complied with state laws, even if MERS's members occasionally strayed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''At times, some MERS members have failed to follow those procedures and/or established state foreclosure rules,'' the spokeswoman, Karmela Lejarde, wrote, ''or to properly explain MERS and document MERS relationships in legal pleadings.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such cases, she said, ''are outliers, reflecting case-specific problems in process, and did not repudiate the MERS business model.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MERS's legal troubles, however, aren't going away. In August, the Ohio secretary of state referred to federal prosecutors in Cleveland accusations that notaries deputized by MERS were signing hundreds of documents without any personal knowledge of them. The attorney general of Massachusetts is examining a complaint by a county registrar that MERS owes the state tens of millions of dollars in unpaid fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As far back as 2001, Ed Romaine, the clerk for Suffolk County, on eastern Long Island, refused to register mortgages in MERS's name, partly because of complaints that the company's records didn't square with public ones. The state Court of Appeals later ruled that he had overstepped his powers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Judith S. Kaye, the state's chief judge at the time, filed a partial dissent. She worried that MERS, by speeding up property transfers, was pouring oil on the subprime fires. The MERS system, she wrote, ill serves ''innocent purchasers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was trying to say something didn't smell right, feel right or look right,'' Ms. Kaye said in a recent interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Little about MERS was transparent. Asked as part of a lawsuit against MERS in September 2009 to produce minutes about the formation of the corporation, Mr. Arnold, the former C.E.O., testified that ''writing was not one of the characteristics of our meetings.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MERS officials say they conduct audits, but in testimony could not say how often or what these measured. In 2006, Mr. Arnold stated that original mortgage notes were held in a secure ''custodial facility'' with ''stainless steel vaults.'' MERS, he testified, could quickly produce every one of those files.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for homeowners, Mr. Arnold said they could log on to the MERS system to identify their loan servicer, who, in turn, could identify the true owner of their mortgage note. ''The servicer is really the best source for all that information,'' Mr. Arnold said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reality turns out to be a lot messier. Federal bankruptcy courts and state courts have found that MERS and its member banks often confused and misrepresented who owned mortgage notes. In thousands of cases, they apparently lost or mistakenly destroyed loan documents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problems, at MERS and elsewhere, became so severe last fall that many banks temporarily suspended foreclosures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some experts in corporate governance say the legal furor over MERS is overstated. Others describe it as a useful corporation nearly drowning in a flood tide of mortgage foreclosures. But not even the mortgage giant <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, an investor in MERS, depends on it these days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We would never rely on it to find ownership,'' says Janis Smith, a <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> spokeswoman, noting it has its own records.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apparently with good reason. Alan M. White, a law professor at the Valparaiso University School of Law in Indiana, last year matched MERS's ownership records against those in the public domain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results were not encouraging. ''Fewer than 30 percent of the mortgages had an accurate record in MERS,'' Mr. White says. ''I kind of assumed that MERS at least kept an accurate list of current ownership. They don't. MERS is going to make solving the foreclosure problem vastly more expensive.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE Sarmientos are one of thousands of American families who have tried to pierce the MERS veil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several years back, they bought a two-family home in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn for $723,000. They financed the purchase with two mortgages from <span class="companylink">Lend America</span>, a subprime lender that is now defunct.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when the recession blew in, Jose Sarmiento, a chef, saw his work hours get cut in half. He fell behind on his mortgages, and MERS later assigned the loans to U.S. Bank as a prelude to filing a foreclosure motion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, with the help of a lawyer from South Brooklyn Legal Services, Mr. Sarmiento began turning over some stones. He found that MERS might have violated tax laws by waiting too long before transferring his mortgage. He also found that MERS could not prove that it had transferred both note and mortgage, as required by law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One might argue that these are just legal nits. But Mr. Sarmiento, 59, shakes his head. He is trying to work out a payment plan through the federal government, but the roadblocks are many. ''I'm tired; I've been fighting for two years already to save my house,'' he says. ''I feel like I never know who really owns this home.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials at MERS appear to recognize that they are swimming in dangerous waters. Several federal agencies are investigating MERS, and, in response, the company recently sent a note laying out a raft of reforms. It advised members not to foreclose in MERS's name. It also told them to record mortgage transfers in county records, even if state law does not require it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MERS will no longer accept unverified new officers. If members ignore these rules, MERS says, it will revoke memberships.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That hasn't stopped judges from asking questions of MERS. And few are doing so with more puckish vigor than Arthur M. Schack, a State Supreme Court judge in Brooklyn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Judge Schack has twice rejected a foreclosure case brought by Countrywide Home Loans, now part of <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>. He had particular sport with Keri Selman, who in Countrywide's court filings claimed to hold three jobs: as a foreclosure specialist for Countrywide Home Loans, as a servicing agent for <span class="companylink">Bank of New York</span> and as an assistant vice president of MERS. Ms. Selman, the judge said, is a ''milliner's delight by virtue of the number of hats that she wears.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At heart, Judge Schack is scratching at the notion that MERS is a legal fiction. If MERS owned nothing, how could it bounce mortgages around for more than a decade? And how could it file millions of foreclosure motions?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These cases, Judge Schack wrote in February 2009, ''force the court to determine if MERS, as nominee, acted with the utmost good faith and loyalty in the performance of its duties.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer, he strongly suggested, was no.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 80 acres of rich farmland that Jeff Freking and his brother Randy bought near Le Mars, Iowa, on Monday for $10,000 an acre would seem to have nothing in common with a condo in Miami or a house in Las Vegas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as prices for agricultural land surge across America's grain belt, regulators are warning that a new real estate bubble may be forming -- echoing the frothy boom in home prices that saw values in Miami and Las Vegas skyrocket and then plummet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It just seems to be going up in leaps and bounds here,'' said Jeff Freking, who bought a similar farm, also in northwestern Iowa, for $6,000 an acre just two years ago. ''Everybody thinks it's crazy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surge in prices has been dizzying throughout the Midwest, with double-digit percentage increases last year in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota and Nebraska. In parts of Iowa, prices for good farmland rose as much as 23 percent last year, according to the <span class="companylink">Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just a few years ago, farmers marveled as land prices began to rise in response to demand for corn to make ethanol. More recently, soaring prices for wheat, corn, soybeans and other crops have driven the increase. Corn futures on the Chicago Board of Trade closed at $7.27 a bushel on Tuesday, up from $3.70 a year earlier. Soybean futures were $13.67, up from $9.52 cents on March 1 last year. Average grain prices, adjusted for inflation, are nearing the giddy levels they reached in the late 1970s, the peak of the last disastrous boom-and-bust cycle for agricultural land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That has regulators worried.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''History has taught us that it is nearly impossible to determine how much of the farmland boom may be an unsustainable bubble driven by financial markets,'' said Thomas M. Hoenig, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, in testimony before the Senate Agriculture Committee last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officials at Mr. Hoenig's bank warn that farmers face a ''huge'' risk that rising interest rates, perhaps combined with falling crop prices, could undercut land values. Farmland values could drop by a third to a half in such a situation, Mr. Hoeing testified.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices have risen so far so fast that ''it's getting scary,'' said Mike Green, a real estate auctioneer. He brought the hammer down last Friday on a 118-acre farm in Yetter, Iowa, that sold for $11,000 an acre, which he said was a record for farmland in Calhoun County, in western Iowa. In December, Mr. Green said, he got oohs and ahs when a parcel went for $9,300 an acre. Last fall, similar farms were selling for less than $8,000 an acre.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's very hard to guess what a property will sell for these days because it seems like it's been changing on a weekly basis,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide data from the United States Department of Agriculture shows that inflation-adjusted farm prices passed their 1970s peak several years ago, but that includes land, especially on the coasts, whose price rose when it was sold for development. University and Federal Reserve Bank surveys, which give a more accurate picture of the value of land used for farming, show that current prices are approaching the top of the last boom when adjusted for inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Farmland values have been pushed up by several factors. As crops like corn, wheat and soybeans bring higher prices, the land on which they are grown becomes more valuable. Low interest rates have also contributed; they draw investors seeking an alternative to low-yielding certificates of deposit and the volatile stock market as well as create an incentive for farmers to buy more land rather than invest their profits elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Farmland has been a favored asset class in a world where a lot of other asset classes have fallen out of favor,'' said Richard A. Brown, chief economist of the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rapid rise in agricultural land prices has raised alarms at the F.D.I.C., which insures bank deposits and monitors the industry's financial health. The agency sent a letter to lenders in December, warning them to not let high farm land values lull them into lax lending practices. Next week, the F.D.I.C. will hold a forum in Washington to discuss its concerns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If it were to be a bubble,'' Mr. Brown said, ''it would be in its formative stages.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today's farmland market has some crucial differences from the 1970s bubble and the housing boom of the last decade. In the 1970s, another period of low interest and high crop prices, farmers loaded up on debt, using their farms as collateral. In the housing bubble, many buyers were seduced by gimmicky loans, such as subprime mortgages with floating rates, that magnified risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, farmers have about one-third less debt over all than they did at the peak of the last boom, according to U.S.D.A. data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a big worry for regulators is that farmers will start taking out loans on property they already own, based on today's elevated values, and use it to buy more property or make other purchases. That would be similar to what farmers did 30 years ago and what homeowners did in the housing boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jason R. Henderson, a vice president at the Omaha branch of the Kansas City Fed, said he had heard reports from bankers that such a pattern might be emerging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Freking said he and his brother had made their latest purchase using all borrowed money. Their banker lent them half of the purchase price, and the rest of the money came from refinancing and consolidating loans on other property they owned, which are worth more at current land values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said there was some sticker shock at the price but the deal made sense because the land adjoined two other properties that the family farmed. He also got an attractive fixed interest rate of about 5 percent, although the loan must be paid off after eight years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everybody's talking big on commodities, so hopefully this pays out,'' Mr. Freking said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rising prices have also brought in speculators. A survey by Iowa State University found that investors made a quarter of farm purchases in the state last year, a slight increase from 2009. ''It's been very aggressive as far as bidding action,'' said Todd Hattermann, an auctioneer who sold a farm in Paullina, Iowa, about 30 miles from Le Mars, for $9,600 an acre last week. Investors, he said, were ''running the values up. A lot of them may not be the final bidder but they're bidding all the way through.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no agreement on whether a bubble is emerging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael D. Duffy, an agricultural economist at Iowa State University who conducts the annual land value survey, said the market appeared fundamentally sound and that land prices were responding properly to high crop prices. ''If you've got good ground, it's worth a lot of money,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bruce Brock, the broker who sold the farm to the Freking brothers, exudes an optimism that would sound familiar to anyone who bought a home in 2006. ''If you look from the beginning of farming in the United States to now, the long-term trend has been up,'' he said. ''There will be market fluctuations where it will go down. But in 10 years, I won't be surprised if our $10,000 land is $20,000.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A crucial part of the securitization market - the Wall Street credit machine that helped set off the financial crisis - is kicking back into gear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last few weeks, a number of big banks have successfully bundled and sold new securities backed by commercial real estate loans. <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> and <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> completed a $1.55 billion deal last month that included office and retail properties. So far this year, financial firms have sold about $5 billion of commercial mortgage-backed securities, almost as much as was done in all of 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More deals are in the works. <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span>, for example is in the process of selling a $1.5 billion commercial mortgage-backed security. If the pace continues, the volume of these sales could hit $45 billion this year, according to <span class="companylink">JPMorgan</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bankers even have a nickname for the postcredit crisis crop of commercial mortgage-backed securities: C.M.B.S. 2.0, referring to new versions of old products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Things have gone vicious to virtuous,'' said Brian Lancaster, a securitization specialist at the <span class="companylink">Royal Bank of Scotland</span>, which in conjunction with <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo &amp; Company</span> recently sold a $1.3 billion commercial mortgage-backed security.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other sectors of this market, including car loans and collateralized loan obligations, are also showing signs of life. But the recovery is being led by commercial real estate, which did not reach the lows that experts expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commercial real estate was supposed to be the next shoe to drop, sending the economy into a tailspin like the housing market did. But while residential prices continue to sputter, the values of office, retail and other commercial properties are stabilizing. As of December 2010, the <span class="companylink">Moody's</span>/Real Commercial Property Index, which tracks prices on such buildings, was up modestly from its August lows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such stability has helped bond investors set prices on the related securities, even in some of the areas most devastated by the crisis. In a recent $2.2 billion commercial deal by <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> and <span class="companylink">UBS</span>, roughly 15 percent of the underlying assets were in Arizona, a state hit hard by the broad real estate problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some on Wall Street, however, are raising warning flags about the new crop of C.M.B.S. deals. The rating agency <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> says that some of the new deals are becoming increasingly complex and underwriting standard have loosened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have seen some examples where appraisals/valuations look quite aggressive to us, especially given the downward property price movements over the past few years,'' the agency said in a recent report titled ''15 months Later... The Caution Flag is Out for C.M.B.S. 2.0.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As part of the securitization process, commercial real estate loans, credit card balances and other types of debt are bundled into bonds, pieces of which are then sold to investors. The yield on a commercial mortgage security is based on the rent or revenue collected on the underlying properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With Wall Street firms aggressively packaging loans at inflated values at the peak of the boom, the total volume of securitization reached $2.5 trillion in 2007, according to <span class="companylink">JPMorgan</span>. Banks issued a record $230 billion of commercial mortgage bonds that year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then the market collapsed in 2008 as the underlying loans soured, helping to incite the worst economic rout since the Great Depression. Some pundits predicted the end of securitization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with investors nervously on the sidelines, the government started a series of initiatives to help kick-start lending, including the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility. Under the program, which was expanded to include commercial mortgage-backed securities, the Federal Reserve lent money to big investors willing to buy such securities. The shopping center owner <span class="companylink">Developers Diversified Realty Corporation</span> hired <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> to prepare one loan backed by 28 properties - worth about $400 million - through the Fed's program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''TALF really helped the markets to recover,'' said Mike Millette, who is responsible for the structured finance group at <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>. ''It did what it needed to do and then disappeared.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the government steps back, Wall Street continues to chug along on its own. Although the securitization market could always become overheated again, banks seem to be taking a more cautious approach - a discipline in part enforced by the government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the Dodd-Frank regulatory reform, banks are required to hold 5 percent of any securities they sell to investors. The move is intended to reduce risk by forcing banks to eat their own cooking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another rule, which will most likely take effect early next year, requires banks and other financial firms that issue asset-backed securities to review the quality of the underlying assets, including commercial real estate. The banks must then disclose their findings to investors. If the assessment shows that the assets did not meet the underwriting standards promised to investors, financial firms must explain the discrepancy in a filing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks are also improving their lending standards on their own. The securities today are more diverse, including multiple loans from a number of developers across the country. The recent deals, for instance, includes a broad set of properties like the Christiana Mall in Newark, Del., the Kenwood Towne Centre in Cincinnati, the Pearlridge Center near Honolulu and 7 Hanover Square in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The banks can cherry-pick the loans they are making and typically only top-quality prime borrowers are getting financed,'' said Tony Plath, a finance professor at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pinchas Zukerman, who is considered one of the world's greatest violinists, has definite opinions about investing. He likes to buy musical instruments and real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm either sleeping in it or I'm playing it,'' he said of his portfolio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After spending most of the last decade staying in hotels while visiting New York to teach at the Manhattan School of Music and perform in concerts, Mr. Zukerman and his wife, the cellist Amanda Zukerman, have gone into contract on a three-bedroom apartment at the Rushmore, a new condominium on the Upper West Side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The asking price for the apartment, which has three bathrooms and 1,712 square feet of space and is on the 23rd floor of one of the Rushmore's two glass towers, was $2.734 million. The developers, the Extell Development Company, would not disclose how much Mr. Zukerman paid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple's main residence is in Ottawa. But since moving to New York from Israel in 1962, Mr. Zukerman has lived in various apartments and houses in places including Manhattan and Snedens Landing, N.Y., an enclave of actors and artists in Rockland County. He has also bought property in Montauk, N.Y., and near Santa Fe, N.M.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Zukerman said he would bring some suitcases to the city at the end of March and start moving into the Rushmore, on Riverside Boulevard and 64th Street. He said he felt it was a good time to invest in Manhattan real estate and was looking forward to being a New York homeowner again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I left the city,'' he said, ''but I didn't leave the city psychologically.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was also tickled about a soon-to-be neighbor at the Rushmore: the Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A-Rod just bought in one of the towers,'' Mr. Zukerman said. ''Those are my Yankees. I don't know him, but I think it says miles about the kind of people who are going to walk in there and buy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a Renowned Dancer, a Choreographed Move</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mikhail Baryshnikov, the dancer and actor, got to know Mr. Zukerman and his second wife, the actress Tuesday Weld, when they were all living in Snedens Landing. Mr. Baryshnikov has been trying to sell his 4.23-acre estate there since November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The asking price for the property, which includes a 5,800-square foot main house and a 1,500-square foot guest house as well as two building lots, is $6.3 million. The main house, which has six bedrooms and five and a half baths, can be bought on its own for $3.995 million, in which case the guest house, with three bedrooms and two baths, would be marketed separately, according to the broker handling the listing, Richard Ellis of Ellis Sotheby's International Realty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Baryshnikov said that while there had been ''a lot of traffic'' at the property, which he bought about 30 years ago, he may consider lowering the prices. He and his wife, Lisa Rinehart, a former ballet dancer, have bought a smaller house in Snedens Landing. They are downsizing as their children, two in college and one in her last year of high school, reach adulthood, Mr. Baryshnikov said. The estate, known as the Red Barn, was made into a residence in the 1930s, and the couple created a large addition in the 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Baryshnikov said he could not fathom leaving Snedens Landing, which is on the Hudson River roughly 25 miles from Manhattan. He described it as ''really kind of wonderful.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You see the river, this silver river right in front of you,'' he said, adding that he had delighted in watching foxes and deer pass through and bald eagles perch on the top of the main house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's something about Snedens Landing,'' he said. ''It's very romantic, it's dignified in the best sense of the word.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has also been home to quite a roster of celebrities. According to Mr. Ellis, who has been marketing properties there for the last 20 years, residents have included John Steinbeck, Orson Welles, Laurence Olivier, Vivian Leigh, Mike Wallace, Diane Sawyer, William Hurt and Ellen Burstyn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apartment for Sale, Tchotchkes Optional</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is somewhat surprising, after visiting an apartment for sale on the Upper East Side, to learn that it has 11 rooms and 6,000 square feet. That is because the rooms are filled - and we are talking packed - with hundreds and hundreds of figurative sculptures. And clocks, hundreds of clocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the clocks would explain why the man who owned the place, Morton Swinsky, a bond trader and Broadway producer who collaborated on nine Tony Award-winning plays, including ''Guys and Dolls,'' ''Chicago'' and ''Billy Elliot,'' was always early, said his daughter, Karen Swinsky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A woodworker visited every Friday to help Mr. Swinsky, who died of prostate cancer last June, place new pieces in the apartment. His collection includes an 800-pound sculpture by the artist Gwen Marcus, several coffee urns bought from Tavern on the Green when it closed, and a rhinoceros head made of yellow matchsticks. There are also likenesses of monkeys, alligators, zebras, Ronald Reagan, Bernard L. Madoff, Mr. Swinsky himself, and garudas - large, mythical birdlike creatures - many, many garudas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you think there are 20 of something,'' Ms. Swinsky said, ''there are probably 40.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soap in each of the four and a half bathrooms is literally hand soap, cast in the shape of tiny hands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everybody knew Dad was quite different,'' said Ms. Swinsky, who along with her sister, Dana Swinsky Cantelmo, is selling the apartment, a duplex on 70th Street near Madison Avenue. It will go on the market on Monday for $10.2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two sisters have spent months using flashlights and magnifying glasses to find the names of the artists on the work that Mr. Swinsky bought or commissioned over the years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christie's expects to offer 350 of his pieces at auction, said Jamie Krass, the auction house's director of 20th-century art and photographs. Mr. Swinsky, having made about 300 bids at the auction house over the years, bought about 160 items from Christie's, worth about $1.8 million, Mr. Krass said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sharon E. Baum of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, who is handling the listing with Heather Johnson Sargent, acknowledged that buyers might have a hard time imagining what the space would look like without all the art. But she said Mr. Swinsky's daughters did not want to wait to have it cleared out and miss a chance to sell in the spring market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers are welcome to buy anything in the apartment, Ms. Baum said, adding, ''Everything is up for discussion.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON (AP) -- More people bought previously occupied homes in January, but sales increased on a rising number of foreclosures and all-cash deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said Wednesday that sales of previously occupied homes rose slightly last month, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.36 million. That was up 2.7 percent from 5.22 million in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rate is still far below the six million homes a year that economists say represents a healthy market. And the number of first-time home buyers shrank to 29 percent of the market. A more healthy level of first-time home buyers is about 40 percent, according to the trade group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreclosures represented 37 percent of sales in January. And all-cash transactions accounted for 32 percent of home sales -- double the rate from two years ago when the trade group began tracking these deals. In places like Las Vegas and Miami, cash deals represented half of all sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason cash sales are rising is that a growing number of purchases are being made by investors, the association said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Millions of foreclosures have forced down prices, and more are expected this year. The median price of a home sold in January was $158,800. That is a 3.7 percent decrease from a year ago and the lowest point since April 2002.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One obstacle to a housing recovery is the glut of unsold homes. Those numbers fell to 3.38 million units in January. But at the January pace, it would take 7.6 months to clear them off the market. Most analysts say a six-month supply represents a healthy supply of homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For January, sales were up in three of the four regions of the country, led by a 7.9 percent rise in the West. Sales were up 3.6 percent in the South, and 1.8 percent in the Midwest. They were down 4.6 percent in the Northeast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The January increase was driven by a 2.4 percent rise in sales of single-family homes, which pushed activity in this area to an annual rate of 4.69 million units. Sales of condominiums were up 4.7 percent, to a rate of 670,000 units.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">As Boston's Economy Grows, Demand for Rental Units Outpaces Condo Market</span>
</div><div class="author">By SUSAN DIESENHOUSE </div><div>1176 words</div><div>23 February 2011</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BOSTON -- Investments in multifamily rentals have been one of the few hot spots in a sputtering economy, and nowhere is that more evident than in the Boston area, where a high-tech economy is enjoying comparatively strong job growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last several weeks, city officials have allowed developers of three buildings with nearly 1,000 units to decrease or eliminate condominiums in favor of additional rentals. Over all, the Boston Redevelopment Authority expects construction to start this year on 21 buildings with a total of 1,855 apartments, nearly all rentals, compared with just 600 starts last year. Of those units 830 were once planned as condominiums, said the authority's director, John Palmieri.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We think we can build this summer after two years when we couldn't,'' said Anthony Pangaro, a principal of <span class="companylink">Millennium Partners</span>-Boston, which has previously developed luxury condominiums downtown. This month Millennium's $200 million Hayward Place project in the theater district sought city approval to convert from 200 condominiums to 265 units, mostly rentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With rents up to $4 square foot and construction costs down to $500 a square foot, Mr. Pangaro said he could build high-quality apartments that would rent for about $5,000 a month. That gives long-term investors a yield in the mid-single digits, good but far from the 2005 peak of 20 percent for condominiums and about 9 percent for apartments, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few weeks ago, the city approved a switch to mostly rentals for a $130 million, 345-unit mixed-income complex in Chinatown, said Kirk A. Sykes, its developer and the president of the Urban Strategy America Fund, who expects to break ground early in 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason he is moving ahead is that he expects average asking rents to rise 3.5 percent this year, compared with a decline of 6 percent in 2009. A year after the building is completed, he said, he foresees an investment return ''in the high teens.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You can't do these projects everywhere,'' Mr. Sykes said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boston is drawing attention from investors and developers because of strengthening real estate fundamentals and an economy that is growing because of 21st-century industries like biotechnology, and an enduring foundation of medical and educational institutions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year Boston is ranked No. 3 as a strong multifamily rental market, up from No. 8 in 2010, by the National Apartment Index released by Institutional Property Advisors, a Marcus &amp; Millichap company. Boston is ranked after New York and Washington.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Job growth is outpacing other metro areas like San Francisco, which has similar demographics, with 49,000 new positions expected this year in Boston, up from 37,500 in 2010. Especially strong sectors include business consulting, technology, life sciences, health care and higher education. The apartment vacancy rate will fall to 4.5 percent, according to the index.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, since 2007 few new projects have started here or elsewhere in the country. At an average of two years to build, it will be five years until the new supply of rental apartments hits the market. ''That's almost unheard-of in the post-World War II economy,'' said Dan Fasulo, the managing director for research at <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>. Boston's supply has long been constrained by a rigorous permit process, high building costs and a lack of buildable sites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given all that, Mr. Fasulo said, it is not surprising that ''there's a race among developers to deliver new product.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One such project is the $300 million, 500-unit building planned by <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span> in a rental complex called West End Apartments it owns adjacent to Massachusetts General Hospital, where the 18,000-person downtown staff will presumably supply a steady stream of tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">South of Boston at the Pinehills, a 3,200-acre planned community in the town of Plymouth, home sales and apartment rentals have been strong through the downturn, said Tony Green, a partner with <span class="companylink">New England Development</span> in the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Pinehills, 1,411 of an expected 3,052 homes are up and occupied. Half of those are in multifamily buildings, the largest a fully occupied 101-unit complex by <span class="companylink">AvalonBay Communities</span>, one of nine builders there. AvalonBay is completing construction on a second, 91-apartment complex with the first move-ins expected by May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With values rebounding there is also heated competition among investors to buy existing buildings, said Thomas M. Alperin, the president of National Development in Newton Lower Falls, Mass., an owner and investor in commercial property in the greater Boston market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In two recent apartment building sales, the Park Lane Seaport for $193.8 million and Garrison Square in the South End for $90 million, the capitalization rates were about 4.5 percent. ''That's an all-time low that provides an adequate margin to justify new development,'' Mr. Alperin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Capitalization rates -- or the first-year yield -- are one measure of the health of the market. Lower cap rates signal that new development offers investors greater returns (about 6.5 percent) than buying existing property, Mr. Alperin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Alperin is in a joint venture with Kensington Properties, a Boston company that owns and invests in multifamily and other commercial properties, to develop a $165 million, 381-unit apartment building downtown, in which the 75 condominiums initially planned have been replaced by rental units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A combination of economics and demographics is behind the surge in rentals. The pool of probable renters is being fed by people whose houses were foreclosed, have lost a job or taken a new one at a lower salary, or fear residential values will remain flat or fall. Aging baby boomers, fed up with shoveling snow and harsh New England winters, are prime targets for rentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boston also has a pool of 94,000 graduate students who rent. Here and nationwide, home ownership has fallen to 66.5 percent at the end of last year, from a high of 69.2 percent, at the end of 2004, according to the Census Bureau. ''That's huge,'' said William McLaughlin, the executive vice president of development and construction in the Northeast for AvalonBay. ''Across our portfolio most new residents could afford a mortgage but at this time have decided to rent.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McLaughlin said AvalonBay planned to start construction this fall on a $90 million, 188-unit apartment building at the Prudential Center in the city's Back Bay, where the company already owns three buildings with a total of 781 apartments. He described the location as ''the best bet in Boston.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a rush into this space,'' he said, ''and we'll see more conversions into rentals,'' adding that he expected all his competitors' projects would eventually be built.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">December Price Slide Delays the Housing Rebound</span>
</div><div class="author">By DAVID STREITFELD </div><div>1072 words</div><div>23 February 2011</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate prices slid in just about every part of the country in December, pushing a housing market that once seemed to be rebounding nearly back to its lowest level since the crash began.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At this dismal point, some economists and analysts say that the damage has been done, and there is nowhere to go but up. Many others argue that the market has still not finished falling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then there are those who maintain that, possibly, things are about to get a whole lot worse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert J. Shiller, the Yale economist who is the author of ''Irrational Exuberance'' and who helped develop the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller Home Price Index, put himself in this last group. Mr. Shiller said in a conference call on Tuesday that he saw ''a substantial risk'' of the market falling another 15, 20 or even 25 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 20-city Case-Shiller composite is already off 31.2 percent from its peak, according to data released Tuesday. Average home prices in Atlanta, Cleveland, Las Vegas and Detroit are below the levels of 11 years ago. A drop the size that Mr. Shiller says he thinks could happen would put Chicago, Dallas, Charlotte and Minneapolis there, too. It would create a lost decade for housing in much of the country even before the effects of inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Shiller said several political trends indicated a dreary future, including the uncertainty over the mortgage holding companies <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> and proposals to reduce the mortgage tax deduction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Shiller's colleague, the economist Karl E. Case, a professor emeritus of economics at Wellesley College, says he does not think the outlook is so dire. He said in the conference call on Tuesday that he thought the housing market was at ''a rocky bottom with a down trend.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The S.&amp; P./Case-Shiller index of 20 large metropolitan areas fell 1 percent in December from November, although the drop was just 0.4 percent when the data was adjusted for seasonal variations. Eleven cities in the index posted their lowest levels in December since home price peaks in 2006 and 2007, up from nine cities in November. Phoenix and New York joined a list that includes Atlanta, Chicago and Seattle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only city in the index that posted a monthly gain on an unadjusted basis was Washington. Five cities posted a gain on an adjusted basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One data point that favored Mr. Case's optimism: The adjusted declines in December and November were about half the drops in the previous two months, indicating the slide might be slowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most analysts seem to fall between Mr. Shiller and Mr. Case in their forecasts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Even though affordability is exceptionally high and housing is incredibly cheap, the double-dip in house prices that began last year will continue throughout this year,'' Capital Economics, a consulting firm, said Tuesday. Their estimate was that prices would drop another 5 percent unless a ''vicious circle'' of falling prices and rising foreclosures developed, in which case prices would be worse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also released Tuesday was the Case-Shiller quarterly index that covers all homes in the country. It showed prices fell 3.9 percent in the fourth quarter and 4.1 percent for all of 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller index is a three-month moving average, which means it changes slowly. It is now less than 3 percent above the low recorded in the spring of 2009, when there was widespread hope that the market was starting to recover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To accelerate the process, the Obama administration offered a carrot for new buyers: a tax credit. The credit did its job, enticing hundreds of thousands of buyers to accelerate their purchases in the fall of 2009 and the spring of 2010. But the credit did not lay the groundwork for a permanent rebound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Every place is pretty much getting hit a second time for essentially the same reasons,'' said Andrew LePage, an analyst with <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span> Information Systems. ''Slow economic recovery, little job growth, still-tight credit, no more government stimulus, a pervasive and gnawing sense that prices could fall more, too few people getting jobs and too many worrying about losing the one they have.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amid all this gloom, one group thinks the situation is much better than generally portrayed: the National Association of Realtors. Its data shows the median existing single-family home price rose in 78 out of 152 metropolitan statistical areas in the fourth quarter of 2010 from the fourth quarter of 2009, including 10 with double-digit increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even as the group asserts that the market's decline has been overstated, it is being accused of having bad numbers of its own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The blog Calculated Risk wrote last month that the real estate group was planning major downward revisions to the last three years of house sales data. <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>, a data company, said last week that it estimated 2010 home sales at 3.6 million, much less than the 4.9 million the National Association of Realtors was claiming. If accurate, the <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> numbers would indicate a market even more troubled than is generally assumed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Against this welter of conflicting claims and dark predictions, many would-be sellers are opting out until that distant moment when they can get what they think they deserve. Some are renting their home after moving to new quarters; others are simply turning down that new job and staying put.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This can work to the advantage of those who plunge ahead. Jordan and Caitlin Van Horn bought their house in the fashionable Seattle neighborhood of Ballard three years ago. Ever since then, the market has slumped. The couple is moving to Alabama and feared the worst when they put their home on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They were pleasantly surprised. Their four-bedroom house fetched $545,000 after less than a week, only 5 percent less than they paid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The lack of inventory really worked to our advantage,'' said Mr. Van Horn, a co-developer of a bookkeeping system for small businesses. ''We feel thankful for the way things turned out.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BE careful when clicking ''send.'' That is essentially the message to brokers and their clients from a state court, which ruled recently in a real estate dispute that e-mails can carry the same weight as traditional ink-on-paper contracts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Given the vast growth in the last decade and a half in the number of people and entities regularly using e-mail,'' handwriting and e-mail should now basically be considered one and the same, according to the decision in Naldi v. Grunberg, which was handed down on Oct. 5 by the Appellate Division, First Department of State Supreme Court in Manhattan. The ruling, which attracted little public notice when it was announced, was appealed on Monday to the Court of Appeals, the state's highest court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As much as communication originally written or typed on paper, an e-mail retrievable from computer storage'' is proof of a deal, according to the court's opinion, which was written by Associate Justice David Friedman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the case involved accusations of breach of contract in a commercial real estate transaction, the decision applies to residential deals as well. Lawyers says the ruling expands the state's Statute of Frauds, a law with roots in 17th-century England that requires all property deals to be agreed to in writing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its decision, the five-judge panel also took an expansive view of a 1994 amendment, saying that if e-mail can be used for financial transactions like taking out business loans, it should be good enough for home purchases, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, a seller or a broker who, in an e-mail, uses a phrase like ''$700,000 was more of what I had in mind,'' he or she ''might have a problem,'' said Robert J. Braverman, a Manhattan real estate lawyer. ''You need to be mindful of what it is you are saying in electronic communications,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though e-mail is hardly a new form of communication, uncertainty persists about how binding it is, which means the ruling in Naldi v. Grunberg could bring some clarity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some brokers in the city said that they were unaware of the case and that their firms not have hard-and-fast rules in place about e-mail exchanges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In most cases a disclaimer can inoculate senders from having e-mail backfire, real estate lawyers said. Mario J. Suarez, a lawyer at Thompson Hine who handles many commercial transactions, suggested that the wording might say the communications ''shall not be deemed an offer, as no documents are binding unless and until executed.'' Kirk Henckels, an executive vice president of Stribling, said he was under the impression that e-mails are ''what we used to do over the phone,'' and that property cannot truly change ownership until a paper document is signed by both parties. Mr. Henckels said the thinking was, ''I can call this off unless I've received it back,'' alluding to a signed contract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard Steinberg, a broker with Warburg Realty, said he had always treated e-mails seriously. He said he had used e-mail as leverage to extract important information in negotiations, with the knowledge that the e-mailed information might be binding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, if the broker for the seller of a co-op wrote in an e-mail that an apartment measured 2,000 square feet, and then an architect determined it to have just 1,500 feet, Mr. Steinberg said he would call the seller out on it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They always respond much more liberally in e-mail than they do in writing,'' he said. ''And guess what? I print it out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Naldi v. Grunberg involves a dispute over a pair of adjacent brick apartment buildings in Midtown Manhattan, at Nos. 15 and 19 West 55th Street, owned by Michael Grunberg, a major landlord.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2007 an Italian developer, Robert Naldi, sought to build a hotel on the property, according to Kevin Nash, his lawyer. In an e-mail, Mr. Naldi offered $50 million for the two nine-story buildings, which have stores on their ground floors and apartments above.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A contract went out for $50 million, and Mr. Naldi, assuming that he was the buyer, began researching how much structural work the 1920s buildings required, Mr. Nash said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, soon afterward, Mr. Naldi learned unexpectedly that Mr. Grunberg had sold the buildings to another hotel developer, <span class="companylink">Ark Investment Partners</span>, for $52 million, which prompted the suit for breach of contract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What happened might seem typical in real estate -- a seller wants to make the most money he can on a sale, after all -- but Mr. Naldi's lawyers dusted off an old e-mail, sent on Feb. 12, 2007, by Mark Spinelli, a broker with Massey Knakal Realty Services.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In it Mr. Spinelli granted Mr. Naldi a right of first refusal, according to a copy of the e-mail published in court documents, meaning that he should have had at least a chance to counter Ark's offer. Mr. Grunberg sought to dismiss the suit, but a lower chamber of the Supreme Court blocked him from doing so, while concluding that e-mail is a legitimate form for deals to take.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Grunberg then took his case to the higher appellate court, where he had better luck. In the October 2010 ruling, the justices said that the suit should be dismissed because there was no real evidence that the two sides had agreed on a deal. Because Mr. Naldi never acknowledged the e-mail from Mr. Spinelli with one of his own -- in essence, because he never pressed ''reply'' -- he could not claim that the right of first refusal had ever been extended to him, the court said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But like the lower court, the justices affirmed that e-mails are binding in real estate negotiations, which is perhaps the most important implication for buyers and sellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Naldi case is continuing. On Feb. 14, Mr. Nash filed papers in the Court of Appeals. He said Mr. Naldi was still seeking damages, ''in an amount to be determined.'' Mr. Grunberg did not return calls for comment, nor did Andrew N. Krinsky, his lawyer.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JON LIGHTMAN and Judy Batalion never learned the name of the sociable beige cat in attendance when they checked out a seventh-floor loft in north Chelsea last fall.But the couple fell for him hard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have a cat ourselves, a graceful adolescent tabby that was a rescue animal,'' said Ms. Batalion, a writer and performer. ''But unlike our Shpilkes, who is anxious and standoffish, this one was incredibly friendly. When we came to visit the apartment, he'd invite us in and practically show us around.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Batalion's husband, a management consultant, added: ''We were so flattered by the cat's attention. He was so warm and social. He'd climb on anyone, even our real estate broker and us. He made the apartment feel lived in, homey.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple, renters in the Flatiron section who were eager to buy, had been looking for a year. After several visits to the north Chelsea loft -- the cat present every time -- they bought the place in December and will move in within a few weeks. But as much as they love their future home, something seems missing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now when we visit the apartment, it seems empty,'' Ms. Batalion said. ''The absence of the cat is noticeable. I guess we'd grown accustomed to him.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The experience of Mr. Lightman and Ms. Batalion bolsters the case, made by some brokers, that the presence of a pet can help sell a property by making the place seem warmer or more appealing. But the couple's experience runs contrary to the conventional wisdom, which is that when a house or apartment is on the market, the presence of a pet -- or even evidence of the pet's existence -- is ill advised. Brokers and stagers generally agree that sellers should remove animals from the premises during times when prospective buyers are likely to visit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Let's face it,'' Starr C. Osborne, founder of a home-staging firm called Tailored Transitions, wrote in her book ''Home Staging That Works.'' ''As much as we love them, they tend to be dirty and smelly, and -- like dreams -- they're often not as interesting or endearing to others as they are to their owners.'' Citing the number of house-hunters with allergies, she added, ''The best pet when staging your home is no pet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Don't get me wrong,'' Ms. Osborne said in a telephone interview. ''I love animals. My dog is sitting on my lap as we speak. But it's rare that other people will love your pet as much as you do. There's nothing appealing about a litter box. Maybe a cute little Yorkie will be a plus, but it's not the norm. Having evidence of a pet is risky, and it definitely narrows the market.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a sentiment many brokers agree with.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I sold an apartment last year where for each open house I had a wheaten terrier in a cage in the living room -- whimpering!'' said Mike Lubin, a vice president and associate broker at Brown Harris Stevens. ''I implored the sellers to take the dog with them, but 50 percent of the time he was there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His worst memory about pets and real estate involves an apartment he sold last year on East 65th Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That owner had seven Yorkies,'' recalled Mr. Lubin, who likes animals personally but thinks they are usually a liability at the showing of a property. ''They all barked like mad in unison whenever anyone came in, and they followed potential buyers from room to room. Ironically we sold the apartment to a non-dog-lover, a man who actually disliked dogs. It was truly a miracle.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet some brokers insist that the presence of a winsome pet can actually help seal the deal. This is one reason Barry Silverman, a Halstead broker, frequently includes his own Jack Russell terrier, Sammy, in photographs of pet-friendly apartments that accompany his listings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People remember the place better in putting their lists together,'' Mr. Silverman said. ''They'll ask for 'the one with the Jack Russell on the stairs.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes the family pet is so winning, a broker will make sure the animal is in evidence during showings. This was the case with a one-bedroom condominium on the Upper East Side, being offered for $749,000, that went on the market this month. Karen Heller, the Halstead broker handling the sale, arranged for the owner's 11-month-old miniature schnauzer, Mookie, to attend the first open house, held on Feb. 13. ''She is friendly, well behaved, cute and a puppy,'' Ms. Heller said. ''I'm hoping she'll be a wonderful sales associate.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mookie is part of the sales campaign by design. But a handsome and sweet-tempered Cavalier King Charles spaniel named Wraggles proved his worth in the real estate market accidentally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His owners, Deborah Pilla and David Volpi, were selling a five-room apartment in a white-glove prewar building on East 85th Street that had Venetian plastered walls, crown molding and hand-stenciled wood floors. During open houses and showings, the housekeeper took Wraggles on walks through Central Park. But one day the housekeeper was late.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Then Wraggles curled up on a Fortuny upholstered chaise in the living room, next to a window overlooking St. Regis Church,'' said Cristina Cote, <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span> broker who handled the sale with her mother, Victoria Terri-Cote. Wraggles proved such a crowd pleaser that the brokers requested that he be present for all future showings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was sent to a doggie spa beforehand so he would look his best, and like clockwork, before the doorbell rang and visitors entered, he would take his place on the ivory and beige chenille chaise next to the window, framed by the treetops and the stone church tower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everyone involved with the ultimate sale of the apartment agreed that Wraggles had played an important part. As Dr. Pilla summed it up: ''The person who bought the apartment told me that with the dog on the chaise lounge and the fire in the fireplace, it felt like a real home.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the apartment was sold in November, for under $2 million, a grateful Ms. Cote sent the sellers a basket of gourmet food that contained chocolates shaped like Cavalier King Charles spaniels. She sent Wraggles a package of gourmet dog biscuits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Wraggles was enchanting prospective buyers uptown, a tiny black affenpinscher named Elbow was working similar magic in a two-bedroom co-op in Tudor City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment, created by combining a studio and a one-bedroom, was in mint condition. But that was not the only attraction. According to June Iseman, the Striblingbroker handling the sale, every visitor fell in love with Elbow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''She escorted every buyer around to see the apartment and waited patiently if they lingered in one room,'' Ms. Isemansaid. ''Sometimes she asked to be lifted onto the sofa -- she was too tiny to get up there by herself -- to show buyers the view of the gardens out the casement windows.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tamasin Ramsay, a 44-year-old United Nations employee who bought the apartment in September for $750,000, said Elbow had been part of its appeal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm a big animal lover,'' Ms. Ramsay said. ''And her presence created a sense of love and family, a sense of belonging. The apartment was beautiful, but what got my attention was the very cute dog that was always bounding around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When there's an animal in an environment,'' she added, ''a warm, living, breathing thing, you feel a sense of love.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before making a final decision, Ms. Ramsay took her parents and a close friend to check out the apartment, specifically requesting that Elbow be present during the visit. And Ms. Ramsay, who acquired some pieces of furniture from the previous owner, still thinks of Elbow fondly. ''I think about her every time I look at the chewed arms on the couch.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes a pet proves so appealing, prospective buyers ask hopefully whether it will be included in the sale. This was the case at a town house on West 71st Street recently offered for sale by Vandenberg, the Townhouse Experts. The house, now in contract, featured a small black cat named Henry, along with a cat door through which Henry could go into the back garden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People would ask, does the cat come with the house?'' said Katharine Muir, the owner. ''And people were very much impressed with the cat door, especially since sometimes a neighbor cat would come in to visit.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the opinion of Dexter Guerrieri, the president of Vandenberg, the cat served as an icebreaker for nervous buyers. And Ms. Muir was not surprised at the interest in Henry and his means of egress. ''New Yorkers are so cat-crazed,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also dog-crazed. When Andrea McDermott, a 26-year-old graduate student, was apartment-hunting last year, a golden retriever named Remy helped her settle on a one-bedroom on East 87th Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I looked at the apartment twice,'' said Ms. McDermott, who is studying school counseling at Fordham and working in her family's business, a company that makes warning lights. ''The first time I visited, there was no dog. But the second time, he was there, and he was such a friendly dog.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I eventually want to get a pet myself,'' she added, ''and this dog made this apartment very memorable. I must have seen 20 apartments, but this one stood out. If you like animals, you'll remember the apartment with the animal.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. McDermott bought the apartment, for $430,000, with the help of her parents. And at the walk-through just before the closing last month, much to her delight, the dog was in attendance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes a pet proves so instrumental in a sale that the memory lingers in the broker's mind years after the ink is dry on the contract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I had a listing at Chelsea Lane a few years ago with a cute cocker spaniel who would help me show the apartment,'' said Sara Settembrini, a senior vice president of Corcoran. The dog was a dirty blond, and as she remembered, his name was Brandy. ''He knew in which order I showed the rooms, and he'd stand at attention while I explained the features of each one.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It wasn't an easy apartment to sell, Ms. Settembrini recalled: ''It was dated and it was dark. There was nothing exciting about the place except Brandy. As far as I'm concerned, Brandy sold that apartment.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Producer prices rose in January to their highest rate in more than two years, hinting at a build up in inflation pressures as the recovery gathers pace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The core Producer Price Index, excluding food and energy, rose 0.5 percent, the highest since October 2008, the Labor Department said on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Including food and energy, producer prices rose 0.8 percent in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The advance came after increases of 0.9 percent in December and 0.7 percent in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in producer prices, which exceeded economists' expectations for a 0.2 percent gain, reflected a jump in pharmaceutical preparations, which accounted for 40 percent of the increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The price increase might be a little troubling because it suggests that inflation is spreading across all raw materials,'' said James Meyer, chief investment officer at Tower Bridge Advisors in West Conshohocken, Pa. ''If you print money and have a stronger economy you're going to have some inflationary pressures,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in core index comes at a time when a surge in commodity prices has caused most advanced economies to raise red flags on inflation. The Federal Reserve has so far shown little concern about pricing pressures, and officials have repeatedly said that core consumer inflation remains too low for comfort. Economists believe that could change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Wednesday that industrial output unexpectedly fell in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industrial production fell 0.1 percent in January after an upwardly revised 1.2 percent jump in December, which had been driven by unseasonably cold weather and heating demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop was the first decline in output since June 2009 and was well below the median forecast for a 0.5 percent increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Excluding motor vehicles and parts, factory production rose 0.1 percent in January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The output of utilities fell 1.6 percent in January, as temperatures moved closer to normal after unseasonably cold weather. Mining output fell 0.7 percent. Manufacturing output in January grew just 0.3 percent after an upwardly revised 0.9 percent gain in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Capacity use, a measure of how fully firms are using their resources, dipped to 76.1 percent from an upwardly revised 76.2 percent. Economists polled by Reuters had predicted a 76.3 percent capacity use rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report from the Commerce Department showed housing starts jumped 14.6 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 596,000 units, from 520,000 units in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists polled by Reuters had forecast housing starts edging up to a 554,000 unit rate. Compared with January last year, residential construction was down 2.6 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New building permits dropped 10.4 percent, to a 562,000-unit pace last month.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">7:24 p.m. Updated</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">ING Group</span> said Tuesday that it would sell most of its real estate investment management business for more than $1 billion in two separate deals and use the proceeds to repay state aid it received during the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis Group</span>, the property broker, will acquire ING's real estate securities business in Europe and Asia as well as its global listed securities unit for $940 million. With the deal, <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span> will add nearly $60 billion in assets to its portfolio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our firms fit together well and our investment program offerings are highly complementary,'' Brett White, chief executive of <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>, said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ING also agreed to sell <span class="companylink">Clarion Partners</span>, the United States real estate investment manager, to the firm's management and the private equity group <span class="companylink">Lightyear Capital</span> for around $100 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the financial system on the brink in 2008, the Dutch government bailed out ING, providing 10 billion euros ($13.5 billion) in rescue funds. As part of the terms of the deal, ING agreed to separate its banking and insurance businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently, the company is moving forward with plans to spin off its insurance operations, possibly through an offering in the United States and one in Europe. The bank, which is set to report fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday, still owes about 5 billion euros, plus a 2.5 billion-euro penalty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With these transactions we continue to deliver on our strategic objectives of reducing exposure to real estate, simplifying our company and further strengthening our capital base,'' said Jan Hommen, chief executive of ING, in a statement.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SEATTLE -- Few believed the housing market here would ever collapse. Now they wonder if it will ever stop slumping.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rolling real estate crash that ravaged Florida and the Southwest is delivering a new wave of distress to communities once thought to be immune -- economically diversified cities where the boom was relatively restrained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last year, home prices in Seattle had a bigger decline than in Las Vegas. Minneapolis dropped more than Miami, and Atlanta fared worse than Phoenix.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bubble markets, where builders, buyers and banks ran wild, began falling first, economists say, so they are close to the end of the cycle and in some cases on their way back up. Nearly everyone else still has another season of pain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When I go out and talk to people around town, they say, 'Wow, I thought we were going to have a 12 percent correction and call it a day,' '' said Stan Humphries, chief economist for the housing site Zillow, which is based in Seattle. ''But this thing just keeps on going.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seattle is down about 31 percent from its mid-2007 peak and, according to Zillow's calculations, still has as much as 10 percent to fall. Mr. Humphries estimates the rest of the country will drop a further 5 and 7 percent as last year's tax credits for home buyers continue to wear off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We went into 2010 feeling gangbusters, thanks to Uncle Sam,'' Mr. Humphries said. ''We ended it feeling penniless, with home values tanking.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fact that even a fairly prosperous area like Seattle was ensnared in the downturn shows just how much of a national phenomenon the crash has been. The slump began when the low-quality loans that drove the latter stage of the boom began to go bad, but the resulting recession greatly enlarged the crisis. Many people could not get a mortgage, and others simply gave up the hunt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, though the overall economy seems to be mending, housing remains stubbornly weak. That presents a vexing problem for the Obama administration, which has introduced several initiatives intended to help homeowners, with mixed success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>, a data firm, said last week that American home prices fell 5.5 percent in 2010, back to the recession low of March 2009. New home sales are scraping along the bottom. Mortgage applications are near a 15-year low, boding ill for the rest of the winter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has been a long, painful slide. At the peak, a downturn in real estate in Seattle was nearly unthinkable. In September 2006, after prices started falling in many parts of the country but were still increasing here, The Seattle Times noted that the last time prices in the city dropped on a quarterly basis was during the severe recession of 1982.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two local economists were quoted all but guaranteeing that Seattle was immune ''if history is any indication.'' A risk index from PMI Mortgage Insurance gave the odds of Seattle prices dropping at a negligible 11 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, the mood here is chastened when not downright fatalistic. If a recovery depends on a belief in better times, that seems a long way off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who must sell close their eyes and hope for the best. Those who hope to buy see lower prices but often have lighter wallets, removing any sense of urgency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Arne Klubberud and Melissa Lee-Klubberud paid $358,000 for a new, 960-square-foot townhouse on trendy Capitol Hill a few weeks after that Seattle Times article was published. Now, with one child and with hopes for more, they need more space. They just put the townhouse on the market for $300,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Obviously, this is not the ideal situation,'' said Ms. Lee-Klubberud, a 32-year-old lawyer. They are hoping to take advantage of the sour market to buy at a good price, but first, they must sell for an amount that is acceptable. ''Everyone has their limits,'' she said. ''We have ours.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a dark, dank Sunday, a handful of people came to look at the three-level unit. One of them was Katherine Davis, who had just sold her house in the far eastern suburbs. It took 14 months, during which she had to drop the price several times. The equity she had accumulated over the decades disappeared quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''At first, I thought it would be nice to come out of this with $200,000, but I adjusted my expectations,'' Ms. Davis said. She ended up with less than half of that. Her goal is to buy a small place in the city, but not yet. ''Selfishly, I'm hoping the market continues to drop,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Increasing numbers of sellers are simply surrendering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Megan and Ryan Dortch tried to sell their one-bedroom Eastlake condo for $325,000 two years ago. They rejected an offer of $295,000 as inadequate. A year later, they relisted it for $289,000, then $279,000, which was less than they paid. Without a sale at that price, they could not afford to buy a place big enough for them and their new baby.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They have given up on real estate. They are renting out their old apartment at a small loss every month, and living in a rented house. ''I don't expect the market to get better,'' said Ms. Dortch, 31, a customer service consultant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither does Gene Burrus, another frustrated seller who became a landlord. ''Rent is so cheap it doesn't make sense to buy now,'' he said. He might reconsider if 10 or 15 percent more comes out of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Redfin, a real estate brokerage firm based in Seattle, says foot traffic began picking up in the last several weeks. Mortgage rates are rising, which could nudge those who need to buy to make a deal now for fear rates will rise even more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But whenever the market finally does pick up, all those accidental landlords will want to unload, putting another burden on the market. ''So many sellers are waiting in the shadows,'' said Redfin's chief executive, Glenn Kelman. ''The inventory is going to expand and expand and expand. I don't see any basis for significant price increases.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While almost every economist is expecting another round of price declines for the next few months, many see a leveling off in the second half of the year. Fiserv, the company that produces the monthly Case-Shiller Home Price Indexes, analyzed prices in 375 communities. About three-quarters of them will be stable by December, Fiserv calculates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're at a period near the bottom but with more volatility than we normally see at this point,'' said David Stiff, Fiserv's chief economist. ''This sort of double dip is unprecedented for housing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe that is why belief in a bottom is as elusive now as fears of a top were in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We would love to have a house,'' said Dan Cunningham, a 41-year-old renter. ''I have more than enough for a down payment. I'm preapproved for a loan. But I have to have confidence it's not going to lose another 20 percent.'' He plans to wait until he sees prices rising before making any offers.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CHARTS: Location, Location, Time: In the real estate market, it's not just important where one buys, but also when one buys. The change in a home's price in the last decade has also depended largely on when the home was purchased. Here is how two cities -- Seattle in a relatively stable market and Las Vegas in a more volatile one -- compared with the national average.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHEN Robert Hassler of Larchmont, N.Y., went to see a lawyer last fall about devising an estate plan, he received two pieces of unexpected advice: wait until Congress enacted changes in tax law, which it did in December, and remain flexible in your planning, so that whatever you do will withstand further changes from Congress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The new law only lasts two years,'' said Mr. Hassler's lawyer, Joseph Septimus of Kostelanetz &amp; Fink in Manhattan. ''That means you have to plan for what we know for 2011 and 2012, and then for what the law may be in 2013 and beyond, because most people are just not going to come back in two years from now to redo their plan.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax law enacted in December included a variety of income, gift and estate tax breaks for people with significant incomes and net worth, along with some potential traps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, Mr. Septimus said, people with less than $10 million need to refocus their estate plans, moving from tax avoidance toward flexible plans for the distribution, protection and management of their assets no matter how Congress tinkers with the tax laws.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hassler, a partner in a national firm that manages industrial real estate, said he learned that ''what's important in your plan is the structuring and having flexibility to adapt my will for future changes in the tax law.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The law set a $5 million-per-person exemption from the federal estate tax and raised the maximum amount that could be passed tax-free to heirs before death to $5 million from $1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trust and estate tax lawyers said it was unlikely that Congress would lower that $5 million threshold, but all those interviewed said it would be imprudent to devise a plan that did not take into account that possibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One key feature of the law is what is known as portability, allowing a surviving spouse to use the $5 million exemption of her deceased spouse, even if he did not leave a will. (Portability is denied to married same-sex couples under a Clinton-era law that remains in effect.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before this change in the law, the only way a couple could use each other's exemption was by creating a credit shelter trust in advance; these trusts also required that couples hold property separately, while most couples own property jointly. With portability, it does not matter if assets were held jointly or separately.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But ''to qualify for portability, you have to promptly file an estate tax return no matter how little the first spouse had,'' said Bridget J. Crawford, who teaches about gender issues in estate tax law at Pace University Law School in White Plains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surviving spouse gets this $5 million exemption under the new portability rules even if the first spouse was penniless -- a valuable tax break for the surviving spouse if she either had $10 million in her own name or later acquired that much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, if you leave all of your assets outright to your spouse, you get the benefit of not owing any tax on appreciated value of up to $5 million in assets, known as a step-up in basis, ''but you lose all the benefits of a trust,'' said Martin Shenkman, an estate tax specialist in Paramus, N.J.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the gift-tax front, the new law allows individuals to give heirs up to $5 million during their lifetimes without incurring gift taxes -- which has intrigued many clients, estate tax lawyers said. Yet the lawyers cautioned against making such gifts outright, especially to children under 40 or so, because of the risk that the children would fritter the money away or ease up on their careers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many lawyers, including Mr. Septimus, recommended disclaimer trusts. These allow the surviving spouse to choose whether to take all or only some of the marital assets in her or his own name -- disclaiming, or waiving his or her right to, the remaining assets -- as a way to create flexibility as familial relationships, personal fortunes and the tax laws change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You cannot overemphasize the fact that you have two years of certainty and then we have uncertainty just as we had from 2001 until the end of 2010,'' said Steve Leimberg, a tax specialist whose Web site on estate and gift tax developments is widely followed by practitioners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trusts can also protect the elderly from having their estates looted by con artists, said Mr. Shenkman. ''Half of people age 85 and older have cognitive impairment,'' Mr. Shenkman said, ''so you want to protect them from our epidemic of elder financial abuse.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Providing for health care costs also needs more attention, because medical advances allow people with chronic, and costly, illnesses to survive for many years. About a fourth of people age 64 to 75 have a serious chronic medical problem, said Mr. Shenkman, the author of ''Estate Planning for People with a Chronic Condition or Disability'' (Demos Health, 2009).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mitchell Gans, a professor at Hofstra University Law School in Hempstead, N.Y., cited a long list of reasons to use trusts, including ''protection against creditors, permitting the beneficiary to continue enjoying benefits from the trust even if bankruptcy were to occur.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are some other key provisions in the new tax law that affect high-income or high-net-worth individuals:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PERSONAL EXEMPTIONS Until last year, personal exemptions were phased out for high-income taxpayers ($254,350 or more for married couples in 2011). This phase-out has now been suspended through 2012. For a heterosexual married couple with two children at the 35 percent tax rate, the annual tax savings is $5,180. However, personal exemptions are still denied to taxpayers subject to the alternative minimum tax, which applies to half of those with cash incomes of $200,000 to $1 million and 40 percent of those making more than $1 million, the Tax Policy Center estimated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ITEMIZED DEDUCTIONS The rules that reduced itemized deductions, including charitable gifts, for high-income taxpayers will also remain suspended through 2012. This suspension is the equivalent of a roughly one percentage point cut in marginal tax rates for high-income taxpayers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAPITAL GAINS Congress continued through 2012 the 15 percent tax on most long-term capital gains. But starting this year, brokers must report both the purchase and the sales price, to stop cheating by those who overstate their cost basis. In 2012, the rules expand to include mutual funds and dividend reinvestment plans, and in 2013 to include bonds and other debt instruments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STATE AND LOCAL TAXES This year and next, taxpayers who itemize may choose whether to deduct their state income tax or their sales taxes, but not both.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX In December, another annual patch, or adjustment, was applied to the alternative minimum tax, which primarily affects married heterosexual couples with children who own homes in high tax states. Nearly 30 million taxpayers would have been affected, but because of the adjustment, just under five million will be, the Tax Policy Center estimated. Another patch is expected for 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taxpayers on the alternative system pay a maximum marginal rate of 28 percent, compared with up to 35 percent for other high-income taxpayers, yet they pay higher total taxes because they lose their personal exemptions, standard deduction and itemized deductions for state and local taxes, as well as for some medical bills. However, deductions for charitable gift and mortgage interest are allowed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a couple with three or more children the alternative levy is the equivalent of paying a tax rate as much as 5.7 percentage points higher, the Tax Policy Center estimated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RETROACTIVE ESTATE TAX Estates of those who died in 2010 can choose to be subject to a retroactive estate tax Congress enacted in December. For estates of $5 million or so, especially if most of the value is in appreciated property that has not been taxed, choosing the tax is smart because no estate tax is applied on the first $5 million and the property gets a readjustment in value, to a fair-market price level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those who elect to avoid the tax get only a $1.3 million step-up in basis, so any gains above that will be subject to capital gains taxes when sold. This option is attractive for the very largest estates because no estate tax is owed and capital gains taxes are due only when property is sold, not when it is inherited.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STATE ESTATE TAXES Many people who will not owe federal estate tax may owe state estate taxes because the exempt amount is typically much smaller than the $5 million federal threshold (16 states and the District of Columbia have an estate tax). In New York, for example, only $1 million is exempt from the state estate tax; amounts above that are subject to tax at rates that rise from 5.085 percent up to 16 percent on the very largest estates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ENERGY TAX CREDIT The tax credit for energy-efficiency improvements to homes has been severely cut, said Laurie Asch, a tax lawyer at Thomson Reuters. The credit was previously 30 percent of energy-saving furnaces, boilers and the like up to $1,500. The new credit is just 10 percent with a $500 lifetime cap.</p>

</div><div class="author">By CARA BUCKLEY   </div><div>707 words</div><div>9 February 2011</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>24</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hundreds of vacant building sites are strewn about New York City, the scars of the housing crash and credit crunch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the city's housing department is hoping to kick-start construction at the lots by extending a deadline by which developers must finish their projects to qualify for tax breaks. But critics said it would cost the city too much in property taxes and would be a missed opportunity to build more affordable housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax benefit in question, called 421-a, bestows property tax breaks for up to 25 years on new multifamily buildings. It was put in place in the 1970s to spur development, but it drew criticism as an unnecessary giveaway as the local real estate market heated up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The benefit, which has been used primarily for luxury development, cost the city $408 million in foregone tax revenue in 2006, according to the city's finance department, and a projected $930 million in 2011, the Independent Budget Office said. So the City Council, in 2006, and State Legislature, in 2007, tightened the program's rules to require that developers build more affordably priced units in order to be eligible for the exemption.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To qualify under the older, more relaxed rules, developers had to file building permits and start laying foundations by June 2008, and complete their projects within three years. This deadline caused a wild flurry of activity as developers rushed to file permits under the old rules: 17,000 building permits were issued in June 2008, according to the Real Estate Board of New York, an increase of more than 300 percent from the same time a year before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then the real estate market went from bad to much, much worse, as demand and lending dried up. Many sites that were to be developed under the old 421-a tax benefit remain fallow as the June deadline draws closer. Now the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, which determines eligibility for the abatement, wants to extend the completion deadline by three years, in the hopes of jump-starting construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rafael E. Cestero, the city's housing commissioner, said that his agency was granting many individual developers extensions anyway, and that this change merely extended benefits that the developers would have taken advantage of had the market never crashed. He also expected the proposed adjustment, scheduled to be the subject of a public hearing on Wednesday, would help the ailing local construction industry, for which unemployment is hovering at 20 percent, according to the New York City Central Labor Council. The Real Estate Board of New York estimates that the number of stalled sites filed under 421-a account for 7,000 to 10,000 units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What we ought to do is get sites in construction, create jobs, fuel the economy,'' Mr. Cestero said, ''I don't think there is any other route to take.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But critics of the proposed change, among them Councilman Brad Lander, said that many of the stalled sites were owned by speculators and that the three-year completion deadline should remain in place. This would mean that many of the fallow sites would have to be developed under the newer, stricter guidelines, as well as include housing for low- and middle-income earners, to receive 421-a benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lander, a Democrat from Park Slope, estimated that the extension could cost the city $420 million in tax revenue, presuming that the extension would lead to the construction of 7,000 units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What we need is affordable housing,'' Mr. Lander said. ''We don't need to be giving a huge bailout tax break to assist vacant sites to become the next luxury projects.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet representatives of the Real Estate Board of New York and several developers said the extension, which does not need Council approval, was needed to help projects get off the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of proposed construction projects, especially in the outer boroughs, do not make any economic sense even with a tax abatement in place,'' one developer, Isaac Katan, wrote in an e-mail. ''In the majority of cases, removing the tax abatement is just the straw breaking the camel's back.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bloomberg administration announced Wednesday morning that it had selected a development team led by Related Companies to build the first phase of a development on the Queens waterfront, which, when completed, will be the largest middle-income complex built since the 1970s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Related, and its partners - Phipps Houses, the largest nonprofit moderately priced housing operator in the city, and <span class="companylink">Monadnock Construction</span>, one of the largest builders of such housing - will erect two buildings at what is called Hunters Point South with 908 rental apartments, at least 685 of which will be set aside for working- and middle-class families earning $32,000 to $130,000 a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The entire project, which was first announced by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg more than four years ago, will offer subsidized housing for an unusually broad swath of working- and middle-class families. The city has invested heavily in the site, by buying this once industrial stretch of waterfront where Newtown Creek enters the East River for $100 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city will also build a 10-acre park and install the necessary water and sewer lines for the entire site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At Hunter's Point South," Mayor Bloomberg said in a statement Wednesday, "not only will we build the largest affordable housing complex in more than three decades, we'll do it on a long-vacant waterfront property that has incredible views and sits adjacent to one of New York City's fastest growing neighborhoods."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project has been a long time coming. Years ago, the Bloomberg administration wanted to use the land to build housing for athletes as part of its ultimately unsuccessful bid for the 2012 Olympics; after the Olympics, the housing would have been converted to apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As developers and investors continued to buy up much of the city's stock of housing for poor and working-class families, Mr. Bloomberg announced plans to build 5,000 units of middle-income housing on the site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephen M. Ross, chief executive of Related Companies, at first hoped to persuade the Real Estate Board of New York, the powerful lobbying arm of the real estate industry, to build it on a nonprofit basis. But Mr. Ross, who then headed the board, had trouble persuading his fellow developers to take it on, and the city was reluctant to turn the site over to a single entity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is something I believe in passionately," Mr. Ross said. "To succeed and prosper, the city has to build work-force housing. It can't be the most expensive city to live and work in. But there haven't been any middle-income housing programs for the past 20 years."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rival developers complained privately that the city was likely to favor Mr. Ross because of his close ties to the Bloomberg administration. City officials went to great lengths to explain why the Related team was chosen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rafael E. Cestero, the city's housing commissioner, said that Related-Phipps-Monadnock had submitted the lowest cost bid and adhered most closely to the city's design guidelines. Indeed, the group was the only one, he said, that offered to build all the apartments for poor, working- and middle-class families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At this point, Mr. Cestero said 75 percent of the units would be subsidized with a $50 million grant from the city, with the remaining units leased at market rates. The Related proposal is a victory of sorts for the city, which was hoping for at least 60 percent of the units to be moderately priced. The city plans to begin building the water and sewer lines next month, along with the first section of a 10-acre park. Construction of the two apartment buildings will not begin until June 2012.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's exciting," said Councilman James Van Bramer, who represents the neighborhood. "The Hunters Point project will bring us an incredible park, a new school, new retail and some affordable housing."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THERE are nearly a million rent-stabilized apartments in New York City. Which means that there are at least a million lucky people who know they have relatively low rent that isn't going to rise too far, too fast. These fortunate souls also know that their leases, especially for apartments in Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn, are worth far more than the paper they are written on, should the landlord or a developer decide to buy tenants out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A whole industry is built around paying tenants to move, and it is cloaked in mystery. Developers, seeking to spend as little as possible, make offers quietly and individually. Neighbors, wary of spoiling a deal, don't talk to one another about those offers. There are no guidelines to help people figure out what an apartment is worth, and no easy ways to calculate the emotional toll that comes with moving from a home, sometimes after decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We always have battles between tenants and landlords as to what the true market value of an apartment is,'' said Luigi Rosabianca, a lawyer and managing member of Rosabianca &amp; Associates, who has worked on dozens of cases involving rent-stabilized apartments, representing both tenants and landlords.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Often, in the end, it comes down to whether one has the stomach for a fight: the longer one of these battles plays out in a building that the owner is determined to empty, the worse conditions tend to get.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The whole process is usually slow as molasses,'' Mr. Rosabianca said. ''These tenancies are sacred.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How much cash it will take to get a tenant to break the sacred bond can vary wildly, even within one building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, at one building on 23rd Street, many tenants took the $17,000 initially offered by the developer, said Steven R. Wagner, a real estate lawyer at the firm Wagner Davis who represented a tenant there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wagner said his client, after months of refusing to budge, skedaddled when the developer agreed to pay more than $400,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are even more extreme cases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 220 Central Park South -- a trophy address by any estimation -- a development team from <span class="companylink">Vornado Realty Trust</span> and the Clarett Group, after years of court battles, has reportedly paid more than a dozen tenants $1.3 million to $1.6 million apiece to vacate their rent-controlled homes so the building can be torn down and a luxury condominium tower put up in its place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokeswoman for the developers, who bought the 22-story white brick building for $131.5 million in 2005, refused to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For anyone outside of New York City, the notion of turning down tens of thousands of dollars simply to remain in an apartment may seem crazy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And to be sure, many rent-stabilized tenants take the first offer they receive and move on with little regret. Some even approach their landlords if they think they can make a quick buck by agreeing to depart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others hold on for dear life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the buyout stories you hear are at best secondhand, whether a tale of landlord threats and intimidation, or of a multimillion-dollar project stonewalled by a recalcitrant renter. That said, almost everybody involved in buyouts -- developers, tenants, landlords and sometimes even lawyers -- is reluctant to discuss the process, even years later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, a longtime tenant of a rent-stabilized apartment and a new landlord, in separate interviews, agreed to provide a peek from two very different vantage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maggie Kim, 34, had heard about people bought out of rent-stabilized apartments, and when a developer bought her building, she knew it might be worth her while to hang tight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When she moved to New York more than a decade ago, she went through all the frustration that usually comes with looking for a place in Manhattan. Then she went to see an apartment in a building owned by ''the friend of a friend'' of her mother. Located in the 40s, near Bryant Park in Midtown, it was a spacious one-bedroom that was clean and, most important, rent-stabilized. At $700 a month, it was about as cheap as one could hope to find in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As an artist, Ms. Kim doubts she could have afforded to live in the neighborhood if she had had to pay market rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the next decade, with the rent increasing only $75, she happily called the apartment home, even after she started making more money and might have been able to afford a bigger place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's Manhattan,'' she said, ''and if you've got a big, cheap apartment to yourself, it is kind of stupid to give it up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The developer first offered to let her move into another building for three to six rent-free months, but she refused. Then she was offered $10,000 to leave. Again, she refused. After turning down yet another offer, this one for $25,000, she decided to consult with Mr. Wagner, the real estate lawyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He found out that the developer had around $22 million in financing outstanding on the project -- making any delays very expensive and giving Ms. Kim some leverage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Weeks went by before the developer reached out to Ms. Kim again, this time offering $75,000. She said no again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Kim said that her decision to fight was easier than it might have been because she had been planning on moving out of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it was still fraught with risk, especially because she did not know what her neighbors were doing. By this point, many had taken the money and cleared out. And as the weeks passed, the building descended into disrepair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It did get a little spooky living there,'' she said. ''There were a lot of problems with rodents, and one night I discovered a homeless man sleeping in the entryway.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those tenants who remained did not speak to one another about the various offers on the table.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was all hush-hush,'' Ms. Kim said. ''Originally, I'd asked the two remaining tenants if they wanted to present a united front, but one backed out because she had negotiated a few tens of thousands more than the original offer of $10,000, I think, and was afraid to lose it. And I don't know what happened with the other guy. He was there after me, and we definitely were wary of discussing our negotiations when we crossed paths in the building.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As part of the settlement, Ms. Kim is not allowed to discuss the exact amount she received to leave her apartment, but it was substantially more than the last offer of $75,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wagner, the lawyer, says big development companies usually figure the cost of buying out rent-stabilized tenants into the overall budget. But they are really just guessing. There is no telling how high a hurdle they will face -- both legally and financially.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He cited several cases in which the gap between the first offer made by developers and that accepted by tenants had been hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the fortunate few like Ms. Kim, being bought out can be a life-changing experience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She moved to Paris, where she has just begun a new venture, HiddenConcerts.com, through which she will host private musical performances in her new apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The venture is another reason she is glad she left New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's no way I had the space to have concerts in my N.Y.C. apartment,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without rent stabilization, she might not have had a Manhattan apartment at all. ''I know there are people who can afford market rate, and then some, but have lucked out with a rent-stabilized place,'' Ms. Kim said. ''That certainly doesn't seem fair. Then again, Manhattan real estate has a lot to do with luck, doesn't it?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, that question is at the heart of the perennial debate over the fairness and effectiveness of rent-stabilization laws.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The windfall payments only add fuel to the always heated discussion, which is picking up as the rent-stabilization law is set to expire in June. Debate persists over whether to extend the law, revamp it or simply let it lapse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the years, it has been revised many times, and in 1993 a significant change made it easier for landlords to destabilize property. Essentially, the law allows landlords to raise the rent as much as 20 percent when a tenant vacates a property. And once the rent goes above $2,000, the vacant apartment is destabilized.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, according to a report prepared by the Rent Guidelines Board, the stock of rent-stabilized apartments has been shrinking. In 2009, 18,588 housing units left rent stabilization, the largest number since the board's first report was prepared in 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, 8,536 rent-stabilized units entered the market that year, mainly through a program that offers developers tax breaks if they include rent-stabilized apartments in their projects. That program -- known as the 421-A tax break -- expired in December, and it is unclear whether the state legislature will reinstate it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between 1994 and 2009, 97,384 apartments were subtracted from the rent-stabilization rolls when they crossed the $2,000 threshold and were vacated. The majority of those apartments -- 75,376 -- were in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many landlords would rather not wait for an apartment to become deregulated over time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Matthew Haines, the founder of PropertyShark.com, which aggregates real estate data from hundreds of private and proprietary sources and puts the information online, is no stranger to tales of New York City real estate woe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as a landlord himself, he was struck by how difficult it can be to persuade rent-stabilized tenants to leave a building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2003, he bought an eight-unit apartment building on West 119th Street that included rent-stabilized apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the building was profitable from the start, even with the regulated units, Mr. Haines wanted to refurbish and upgrade it, and bring all the rents to market rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The experience, he said, was enough to make him ''never want to be personally involved in a building again.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was in the building every day working on it with my hands,'' Mr. Haines said. ''I let the tenants know that if the unit they were living in was no longer ideal for their life needs, I would give them money to help them move on.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I gave one woman a couple of thousand dollars to help her move to a bigger place in the Bronx,'' he recalled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Haines was eventually able to buy out four of the tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you want to talk about the daily experience of most New Yorkers,'' he said, ''they don't get half-million-dollar buyouts. Usually, from what I have seen, they get four or five thousand dollars and don't engage a lawyer.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he had a holdout who drove him crazy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I had a tenant in a stabilized apartment who did not pay his rent for five months,'' he said, adding: ''He was employed. I have no idea why he didn't pay his rent.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After consulting with a lawyer and deciding that an eviction process would be both lengthy and expensive, he paid the man $4,000 to move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The law creates so many situations where one person can hold all the other people hostage,'' he said. He got so fed up with ''the mental energy that goes into dealing with the bureaucracy'' that he sold his share of the building to his partner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was the indignity of it all,'' he said. ''Now I just write a check and invest in properties without getting personally involved.''</p>

</div><div class="author">By ALISON GREGOR   </div><div>957 words</div><div>6 February 2011</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>9</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EVEN in a sluggish market, property developers are continuing to bet on Long Island City's transformation from towering smokestacks to residential towers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last August TF Cornerstone, one of the city's most prolific builders, broke ground on a 41-story tower at 46-15 Center Boulevard that is to have 367 rental apartments when finished in April 2012. In December at 45-40 Center, the developer poured the foundation for a 32-story high-rise that will have 345 rental apartments, and in March it will begin a third tower, at 45-45 Center, with 806 rentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By 2013, along with those three towers, TF Cornerstone plans to have finished a fourth, with 586 apartments, at 46-10 Center, directly behind the huge Pepsi sign on the East River waterfront.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">K. Thomas Elghanayan, the chairman of TF Cornerstone, said he wasn't worried about going ahead with high-rise buildings in a city development market that remains largely stagnant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We know the market there,'' Mr. Elghanayan said. ''We're able to get the financing, and no one else is building. I believe by the time we finish these four buildings, the whole community will be an established market, and we'll do well.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long Island City's formerly industrial waterfront, only a subway stop away from Manhattan, was designated by the city and state for cleanup and redevelopment in the early 1980s. A plan was adopted to create roads and infrastructure on 74 waterfront acres to support 11 residential towers, two schools, a park, and a library designed by the architect <span class="companylink">Steven Holl</span> and his partner Chris McVoy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Queens West Development Corporation, a government agency, has been working with private developers, who lease the land they build upon, to achieve that plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are now seven apartment towers in the area. Neighborhood amenities include parking garages, a new Duane Reade store and a supermarket called Food Cellar. A spa, a wine shop and more restaurants are opening or are planned. Vernon Boulevard is a thriving commercial strip with a new health food store and restaurants like Madera Cuban Grill and Steakhouse and Testaccio Ristorante.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The existing towers, the oldest of which is Citylights, built in 1997, have a total of about 2,600 apartments (not including a building with senior housing). The four new glass buildings -- which, with two of the existing buildings, are part of what TF Cornerstone calls East Coast -- will add about 2,100 apartments. New York City also has a plan to develop 5,000 apartments, about 60 percent of them for middle-income residents, on 30 of the 74 acres immediately to the south at Hunters Point South. TF Cornerstone has submitted a plan to participate in that development as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One-bedroom rentals in Long Island City's waterfront area start at $2,000 a month, while two-bedrooms start at $2,400 to $2,500 a month, said Silvette Julian, a vice president and project director with the brokerage Nest Seekers International. Landlords in the area said they were optimistic that demand for apartments would continue, especially among renters priced out of Manhattan. Over the last decade, <span class="companylink">AvalonBay Communities</span> built two rental towers, Avalon Riverview and Avalon Riverview North, and both have rented easily, said Frederick S. Harris, a senior vice president of AvalonBay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There hasn't been a lot of competitive price pressure,'' he said, meaning the company has not had to reduce rents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year ago, TF Cornerstone began testing the sales waters with condominiums at the View, a glass-clad terraced building that looks a bit like an Incan pyramid, at 46-30 Center Boulevard. The 185-unit building is more than half sold, with prices at $800 to $1,000 a square foot, Mr. Elghanayan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among available units in mid-January, a one-bedroom was listed for $616,000; a two-bedroom for $840,000; and a three-bedroom for $995,000. Common charges on those units ranged from $546 to $981 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Elghanayan said the View had mostly larger apartments, even some four-bedrooms, because the developers believe Long Island City's waterfront is evolving into an attractive neighborhood for families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 662-seat school for kindergarten through eighth grade will be built by the New York City School Construction Authority adjacent to the rental building going up at 46-15 Center. The area already has one small school, Public School 78Q, for kindergarten through fifth grade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10-acre Gantry Plaza State Park is being expanded, and the library design was recently approved by the Queens Library Board of Trustees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each building in the East Coast development has its own fitness room and amenities, but the 806-unit building will have a 1,000-car parking garage, along with an amenity center for all residents of East Coast buildings. On top of the parking garage will be a recreational area with a pool, tennis courts, beach volleyball courts and other outdoor amenities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recreational area will also have a large gym for which East Coast residents will pay a nominal membership fee to join, Mr. Elghanayan said. Those amenities should be available in early 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of people don't even know this development is here yet,'' he said. ''They have a vague idea of a Pepsi sign and seeing it as they cross the Queensboro Bridge. But once you get out here, it's pretty spectacular.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next year, <span class="companylink">Fidelity Investments</span> will move from Lower Manhattan to Jersey City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deloitte &amp; Touche, the auditing and financial advisory firm, is also leaving the area, for Rockefeller Center, while a neighbor, the Japanese bank Nomura, appears headed to Midtown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loss of additional companies from the city's historic financial district and the surrounding blocks has in the past led to hand-wringing by planners, politicians and landlords about the dubious future of Lower Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this time, the news has been greeted with as many yawns as laments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finance still dominates the neighborhood, but Lower Manhattan has changed remarkably over the past 10 years. The residential population has more than doubled since Sept. 11, and the number of hotels has tripled to 18. More important, there are a growing number of law firms, tech companies and nonprofit organizations moving into the district.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the 60 media firms that now, or soon will, call Lower Manhattan their home are Newsweek, which recently merged with The Daily Beast; The Daily News and <span class="companylink">American Media Inc</span>., publisher of The National Enquirer, Playboy and other titles. <span class="companylink">Conde Nast Publications</span> is negotiating a 1 million-square-foot lease at 1 World Trade Center, the skyscraper under construction at ground zero. And the number of tourists continues to swell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You never want anyone to leave,'' said Elizabeth H. Berger, president of the Alliance for Downtown New York. ''But the real story is that while financial services remains our signature industry, Lower Manhattan has diversified. The bottom line is we're a very attractive place for a lot of different kinds of commercial tenants.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 40 percent of residents walk to work, Ms. Berger said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Federal Reserve Bank is still in Lower Manhattan, as is <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>. <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> recently built a new headquarters for thousands of employees. Oppenheimer Funds, Dow Jones and <span class="companylink">Commerzbank</span>, whose leases expire soon, are expected to remain in Lower Manhattan. <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>, whose headquarters is in Times Square, is looking for more space there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the very institutions that symbolize the citadel of capitalism are moving or changing in ways that will continue to transform the old financial district. With an ever-increasing percentage of trading conducted electronically at both the New York Stock Exchange and the Commodities Exchange, financial firms no longer feel that being located near those institutions is necessary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span> moved to the Empire State Building from Lower Manhattan last year, and next year, the <span class="companylink">Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation</span>, which clears and trades securities for many brokerages and banks, will move the bulk of its operations and 1,400 employees to Jersey City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both <span class="companylink">American International Group</span> and <span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span>, once among the largest employers in the area, are shrinking. So the loss of Deloitte, and possibly Nomura, is a blow to Lower Manhattan, some real estate executives say, especially with at least two skyscrapers being built at ground zero.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The situation with Nomura and Deloitte isn't the end of the world,'' said Peter G. Riguardi, president of New York operations for <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>, a commercial real estate broker. ''But it's disappointing, a setback.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the 1960s, financial firms have been moving from the area to more modern buildings in Midtown, where they could be closer to clients and to the homes of their workers. Concerned about costs, banks began shifting their data operations to the office towers sprouting on the Jersey City waterfront 20 years ago. Fidelity, like its rivals <span class="companylink">Charles Schwab</span> and <span class="companylink">TD Ameritrade</span>, also moved there to reduce costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for many city officials, landlords and real estate executives, the idea that Deloitte and Nomura would remain in the financial district was a foregone conclusion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last August, the Bloomberg administration agreed to provide Deloitte with up to $21 million in tax breaks to expand its payroll, with the understanding that it would enlarge its presence at the World Financial Center. It would take as much as 630,000 square feet as it moved its world and United States headquarters from Midtown to Lower Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in December, Deloitte began to focus on Rockefeller Center, which offered more prestigious, but older and presumably more expensive office space in Midtown. Real estate executives familiar with the negotiations said that many Deloitte partners preferred being in Midtown, closer to their competitors and to Grand Central Terminal. Since the deal is not yet finalized, no one involved is willing to discuss it. But city officials told Deloitte that they would be far less generous with tax incentives if the company left the financial district.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate brokers said that Deloitte's move to Rockefeller Center would be dependent, in part, on the law firm <span class="companylink">Chadbourne &amp; Parke</span>'s vacating its offices there. The brokers said that the law firm is talking to Boston Properties, which was hoping to build a new billion-dollar office tower at Eighth Avenue and 55th Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nomura had also nearly renewed its lease at the World Financial Center when the bank opened talks with the owner of Worldwide Plaza, an office tower on Eighth Avenue between 49th and 50th Streets. Nomura's current landlord, Brookfield Office Properties, is still battling to keep the bank downtown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Downtown's success cannot come just from financial services,'' Mr. Riguardi said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loss of both Deloitte and Nomura, more than 1 million square feet combined, would increase Lower Manhattan's already rising vacancy rate. But officials contend that the neighborhood, where rents are about 30 percent lower than in Midtown, will be increasingly attractive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, the city's two newest and most technologically advanced skyscrapers are expected to open in 2013 at ground zero. Conde Nast, which was negotiating to bring its stable of chic magazines to the first tower, would draw an increasing range of companies to the area, brokers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seth W. Pinsky, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, said that financial services must remain an important part of that area's economy. But, he added, ''We're encouraged, though, by the complementary evolution that has been taking place in the area, evidenced by the explosive growth of its residential population and the arrival of new and growing industries.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the Mortgage Bankers Association bought a state-of-the-art office building five blocks from the White House in 2007, the industry trade group thought it was a wise investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was -- just not for the Mortgage Bankers Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, the trade group sold the building at a huge loss. On Thursday, the new owner flipped the property for a hefty profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mortgage group never envisioned such a debacle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We came to the inescapable conclusion last year that owning our own building was the smartest long-term investment for the association and it is only right that the national association for the commercial and residential real estate finance industry owns its property," Jonathan L. Kempner, the former chief executive of the mortgage group, said in 2008 after moving into the 170,000-square-foot building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then the real estate market crashed, causing thousands of property owners to sell buildings for less than their mortgage - including the trade group for mortgage lenders. The group, according to news reports, had briefly fallen on difficult times after struggling to find tenants for its building and losing some 600 dues-paying members in the wake of the mortgage meltdown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the height of the mortgage bubble in 2007, the mortgage group bought the newly constructed glass tower for $79 million, with the help of $75 million in financing arranged by <span class="companylink">PNC Bank</span>. Less than three years later, the Mortgage Bankers Association sold the building for $41 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's more than doubled in value since then. The real estate data firm CoStar, which last year bought the trade group's building at 1331 L Street, flipped the property on Thursday for $101 million, generating a $60 million profit. CoStar sold the property to GLL Real Estate Partners, a German property-fund manager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CoStar, which occupies the majority of the office space in the building, is staying put. Unwilling to abandon the 10-story building's panoramic skyline views or the allure of its Italian marble-floored lobby, CoStar negotiated a long-term lease with GLL.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The opportunistic acquisition of this building for our headquarters office was part of our larger strategy to create value through our occupancy of the building," Andrew C. Florance, CoStar's founder and chief executive, said in a statement. "This sale will enable us to unlock the value of this formerly distressed property and provide an attractive return on our investment."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal is scheduled to close later this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the mortgage group, they are now among the ranks of the nation's renters. The group relocated to 1717 Rhode Island Avenue, just a few blocks from its former home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move was necessary, the group's new chief executive, John Courson said, because staying in the building would have been "economically imprudent."</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scott James is a columnist for The Bay Citizen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tenancies-in-common, a type of shared homeownership that is widespread in San Francisco, were once considered an affordable option for first-time home buyers in an expensive city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now some homeowners, unable to sell, are calling them traps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the recession, sales and property values of T.I.C.'s have dropped more than the market as a whole. At the same time, mortgages for these properties have become scarce, which has diminished the pool of potential buyers. Some units have been on the market, unsold, for more than a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it could get worse, according to about a dozen experts familiar with the situation. City ordinances are clashing with real estate realities, and many T.I.C. owners might lose their homes unless city leaders intervene.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That, however, would take a majority of the Board of Supervisors, which appears unlikely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, on Wednesday the city once again toyed with the fates of these besieged homeowners with its annual condo conversion lottery. The process transforms selected T.I.C.'s into condominiums, which are more easily financed and sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clutching their application forms like Willie Wonka chocolate bars in the hope of finding a rare golden ticket, 2,309 property owners applied for the lottery; only 200 were picked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rachel Pechter had her hopes up for the seventh straight year. Ms. Pechter, a stay-at-home mom and a San Francisco native who grew up in a rental, and her husband, an electrician, used their savings to buy a small two-bedroom T.I.C. in the Castro in 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We were just excited at the time to buy a house,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now they have two children and need more space, but there are no buyers. ''We're stuck,'' Ms. Pechter said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike condominium units deeded to their owners, T.I.C. apartments share one deed for an entire building, creating co-ownership of the whole property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having one's financial fate so tied to others -- sometimes strangers -- makes these properties less desirable and less expensive to buy, hence their relative affordability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of T.I.C.'s has grown since limits were put on condominium conversions nearly 30 years ago as a way to protect tenants' rights, a popular cause in a city where two-thirds of the residents are renters. The idea was to thwart speculators from converting buildings to condos to raise rents, since condos are not covered by rent control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, some homebuyers transformed buildings into T.I.C.'s, which are subject to more tenant protections, if rented. The assessor-recorder's office estimates that at least 5,000 buildings are now T.I.C.'s, home to tens of thousands of residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To secure financing, many T.I.C. buyers obtained ''fractional mortgages,'' a nontraditional loan that allowed them to finance their part of the building. Few banks ever wrote those exotic loans, and many that did have stopped since the recession. Those that write the loans charge higher rates, can require 25 percent or more down, and do not offer 30-year fixed terms -- only adjustable-rate five- or seven-year loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Julian Hebron, San Francisco branch manager for RPM Mortgage and editor of thebasispoint.com, a Web site that reports on loan rates, said fractional loans were ''just too much risk for most lenders.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's non-standard,'' Mr. Hebron said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those unusual loan terms have consequences. Many of those short-term mortgages are expiring now or in the next year or two. At the same time, T.I.C. prices have dropped at least 20 percent since 2008 (down 38 percent in some cases), according to an analysis by Paragon Real Estate Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When those loans reset, people could be in a world of hurt,'' said Britton Jackson, a veteran agent with Zephyr Real Estate. Without equity to refinance, Ms. Jackson said, many could lose their homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To prevent this from happening, Scott Wiener, a city supervisor for District 8, which contains more T.I.C.'s than any other, wants a one-time expansion of condo conversions. Only owner-occupied units in good standing would qualify -- no real estate speculators -- and a hefty fee would be charged that would go toward financing lower-cost housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Board of Supervisors rejected a similar proposal last year, and the new board does not appear to have the votes to pass such a plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The San Francisco Tenants Union is ''absolutely opposed'' to any increase in condo conversions, said Ted Gullicksen, the group's executive director.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gullicksen called most T.I.C. owners ''elite,'' noting that properties sold for an average of $700,000 before the recession. Any tinkering with the current system could undermine rent control, he warned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Pachter is not rich, but she is lucky. This week she beat the odds and won the condo conversion lottery. ''There's a light at the end of the tunnel,'' she said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SUNNYVALE, Calif. -- City officials are hoping that <span class="companylink">Nokia</span>'s new building here, transformed in just six months to a gleaming corporate headquarters from a structural skeleton, will be the catalyst to revive a troubled 36-acre downtown redevelopment project after more than a decade of false starts by one developer after another.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The regional operations of <span class="companylink">Nokia</span>, the Finnish cellphone maker, will be centralized in the $76 million building, which is home to some 500 employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The <span class="companylink">Nokia</span> lease is a game changer,'' said L. Gerald Hunt, a managing partner of the Quattro Realty Group, a court appointed receiver of the building. Quattro is serving as the developer on a fee basis and has no ownership in the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To complete the <span class="companylink">Nokia</span> transaction, which was signed last May, Mr. Hunt had to overcome several obstacles. Many tenants might be wary of leasing a property that was half completed in a region that already had a surplus of vacant finished buildings. And the fact that the building was in receivership might not fill prospective tenants with confidence in the owners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Technically, the project is owned by a venture of RREEF, an institutional investor based in San Francisco, and Sand Hill Property Company of San Mateo, Calif., which ceded control of the property to the courts in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hunt would not disclose the lease terms, citing confidentiality. Office space in Silicon Valley has hovered in the mid-$30s per square foot annually for the past year, according to Colliers International, a real estate brokerage. <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span> represented <span class="companylink">Nokia</span> in lease negotiations, while Cassidy Turley/CPS represented Quattro.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Equally unusual, at least among the high-tech businesses of Silicon Valley, <span class="companylink">Nokia</span> decided against creating a stand-alone, enclosed campus, with features like its own commissary and gym. On looking for a location in which to consolidate its offices in Santa Clara County, ''there were many vacant buildings, but they tended to be isolated places,'' said Karen Lachtanski, a spokeswoman for <span class="companylink">Nokia</span>. ''We wanted to be in an area with amenities, such as being able to go out at lunchtime and have a choice of different places to eat.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The addition of hundreds of <span class="companylink">Nokia</span> employees to the city's downtown benefits merchants, particularly those on historic Murphy Avenue, a row of mostly vintage buildings that stands between the Caltrain commuter rail station and the new office building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Some restaurant owners on Murphy have told us they have already seen an increase in their business'' since December, when the <span class="companylink">Nokia</span> employees began arriving at the Sunnyvale office, said John Pilger, the city's spokesman. An official ribbon-cutting ceremony is scheduled for Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sunnyvale, a city of some 140,000 people about 50 miles south of San Francisco, is less well known than other Silicon Valley cities like Palo Alto or Cupertino, but is a major job center. The city says it has a daytime population of 230,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The history of Sunnyvale mirrors that of Silicon Valley as a whole. The city was a whistle-stop for local farmers until the early 1940s, when the federal government built up the military industry on the West Coast. Sunnyvale and surrounding cities remained the home of major contractors throughout the cold war; <span class="companylink">Lockheed Martin</span> remains the city's third-largest employer, Mr. Pilger said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like many other cities, Sunnyvale has tried to use various redevelopment tools to create a coherent, pedestrian-friendly downtown area. In the late 1970s, following the fashion of the times, the city built a regional downtown mall to compete with suburban shopping centers. But less than 20 years later the mall, called Sunnyvale Town Center, changed hands, began to founder and went into receivership in 2002.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the closing, a revolving cast of developers failed to revive the project. In 2006, a set of owners razed the mall and proposed a mixed-use center with 500,000 square feet of retail, 292 residential units and 275,000 square feet of office space, with more than 5,500 parking spaces. They were unable to find financing, and the project changed hands several more times. The last owners found their financing cut off as real estate crashed in 2007 and the project went into receivership again, this time with Mr. Hunt as the receiver.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While lenders are generally wary of extending more money to failed projects, the interest from <span class="companylink">Nokia</span> was sufficient to induce the current lenders -- <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> and <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo</span> -- to advance $70 million to complete the building and related infrastructure like streets and sidewalks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We were given a project that was distressed, and with work and some luck we were able to add value,'' Mr. Hunt said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He may need further luck. His next challenge is to find an investor to buy the entire redevelopment area, which has an estimated value of $750 million when all buildings are completed.</p>

</div><div class="author">By ALISON GREGOR   </div><div>1338 words</div><div>2 February 2011</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2011 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the developer Harry Macklowe contemplated building a boutique office tower with unparalleled amenities at 510 Madison Avenue in the late 2000s, he expected it would be filled with hedge funds and other financial sector tenants who would pay rents well above $100 per square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the economy slumped in late 2008, and Mr. Macklowe found himself fighting to maintain ownership of 510 Madison, at 53rd Street, where just one company had signed a lease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He lost that ownership battle to Boston Properties last September. Now, a series of leases signed at 510 Madison late last year for well north of $100 a square foot signifies a turnaround for the building -- and may presage a recovery of Manhattan's overall high-end office market, brokers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Boston Properties had the vision to buy the building at a time in the market five months ago when even then people were very cautious about $100 rents,'' said Paul Amrich, an executive vice president of the commercial brokerage <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>, which is representing 510 Madison. ''But they knew the trophy status of the building and the location of the building would prove that we would get to those rents again.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While there were a total of 91 office leasing deals signed in dozens of Midtown buildings for $100 or more per square foot at the height of the office market in 2008, that number plummeted to just 18 deals in 2009, according to data from the commercial brokerage <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tally for 2010 is about the same, with a total of 19 deals signed in eight buildings, including three at 510 Madison.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many of those deals took place late in the year, reducing the inventory of available space by 23 percent in buildings that <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> considers ''trophy'' properties -- and potentially capable of capturing rents of $100 or more per square foot. Those 52 Midtown buildings tend to be located around the Plaza Hotel on Fifth Avenue, in what is known as the Plaza district, and many have views of Central Park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They may seem more like country clubs than workaday office buildings, with grand lobbies and elevators, tight security and amenities like upscale restaurants to attract financial companies for whom image and high profit margins go hand in hand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those 52 buildings had a vacancy rate of 10.1 percent, compared with 13 percent in 2009, and are poised to outperform the office market in general this year, said Cynthia Wasserberger, a managing director of <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of that has to do with the recovery of the financial sector and its endless race to trade up into more prestigious office space, she said. With office rents still well below their 2008 peak, landlords are still offering concessions to offset the cost of moving. That may encourage financial tenants looking to upgrade, Ms. Wasserberger said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It sounds kind of funny to say tenants would be taking advantage of a $100 rent,'' she said, ''But a lot of tenants with leases up for expiration may find it justifiable to say, 'I'd rather lock in today at $100 a foot, knowing this building was leasing at $150 or $180 a foot in 2008, so it's a relative bargain.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several towers were developed or rehabilitated in the market frenzy to achieve steep rents, but 510 Madison is the only new office building in the Plaza district.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's an extremely central and rare location to be able to build a brand-new building,'' Mr. Amrich said. ''That alone sets us apart.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While 510 Madison's Central Park views are limited to the top floors on the northwest side, the tower, which was designed by Mr. Macklowe, SLCE Architects and Moed de Armas &amp; Shannon Architects, has column-free interior space, which allows financial companies to create trading floors, as well as 10-foot ceilings with floor-to-ceiling windows in a glass facade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Newer buildings can be built with amenities that draw financial companies. For instance, 510 Madison will have a top-notch fitness club with a 50-foot pool, a large landscaped and furnished terrace, a private dining area for tenants and their clients and a generator that can provide power in a blackout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boston Properties paid $287 million for the 350,000-square-foot office tower and acquired a junior loan on the property for $22.5 million. Besides the three leases signed in 2010 with Senator Investment Group, Chieftain Capital Management and Valinor Capital Partners, Boston Properties also managed to retain the Jay Goldman &amp; Company hedge fund, which Mr. Macklowe signed in 2007 at $135 a foot, at the same rent but on a higher floor. Floors 25 through 28 have been leased, with the exception of 6,000 square feet still available on the 27th floor, Mr. Amrich said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hedge funds, private equity groups and wealth management firms that typically seek expensive space tend to be smaller companies, requiring perhaps 5,000 to 25,000 square feet as opposed to 100,000 square feet or more, Ms. Wasserberger said. For that reason, if 510 Madison continues to lease as anticipated, it may account for many more leasing deals of $100 or more per square foot in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If the numbers were 19 deals in 2010, I bet we see closer to 40 in 2011,'' she said. ''The reason is 510 Madison is now open for business. It's a 30-story building, and those are going to be some partial- and single- and double-floor tenants, so that could account for a sizable number of deals.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, the higher the floor the higher the rent, brokers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's always that premium for the tower view,'' said Alan Desino, an executive managing director of the commercial brokerage Colliers International. ''Is there a building right now anywhere in Manhattan that on the base floor you're going to pay $100 a foot? Probably not.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A large part of 510 Madison's allure is its location in the Plaza district. Another banner office tower developed speculatively, 11 Times Square, was also hoping for $100-per-foot rents, but its location on Eighth Avenue near the <span class="companylink">Port Authority of New York and New Jersey</span> has been a detractor, Mr. Desino said. So far, the law firm Proskauer Rose is the building's lone large tenant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the right kind of building -- for example One Bryant Park on Avenue of the Americas, known as the <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> tower -- delivered at the right time can create a desirable submarket around it, even driving up rents in neighboring buildings, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One Bryant Park is a phenomenal building,'' Mr. Desino said. ''Just due to the efficiency and space you have floor-to-ceiling and, let's face it, the views are phenomenal. It's been able to achieve $100 rents in an area that, three years ago, I would have said, not a chance.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One Bryant Park also happens to be certified by the United States Green Building Council, as does 11 Times Square, and 510 Madison is pursuing that certification. A recent study by the CoStar Group, a real estate information company in Washington, showed landlords could achieve an average premium on rents of 5 to 10 percent nationally if a building was certified as environmentally friendly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if it does not guarantee higher rents, that certification carries a certain cachet, said Christopher Macke, a senior real estate strategist at the CoStar Group. ''Maybe you don't get the premium rent, but you get the tenant, and the other guy doesn't,'' he said. ''Put another way, in a green building, you have a higher absorption rate than one that's not green.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The manufacturing sector in the United States expanded in January, while construction spending fell unexpectedly in December, according to economic data released Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management's monthly manufacturing survey fits into a pattern of steadily improving data and comes ahead of Friday's closely watched payrolls report, which is expected to show that the United States economy added jobs for a fourth month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The manufacturing index climbed to 60.8 in January, the highest reading since May 2004 and well above analysts' expectations. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prices paid component of the index jumped to 81.5, from 72.5 the previous month, and the employment index reached its highest level since April 1973.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a good number,'' said Gary Thayer, chief macroeconomic strategist at <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo Advisors</span> in St. Louis. ''Manufacturing is outperforming other parts of the economy, but we're also seeing some inflationary seeds in costs rising.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most recent growth data showed the American economy gathered speed in the fourth quarter to regain its prerecession peak with a big gain in consumer spending and strong exports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economy grew at a 3.2 percent annual rate in the final three months of 2010, after expanding at a 2.6 percent pace in the third quarter, the Commerce Department said on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the latest report on construction, the Commerce Department said that spending unexpectedly fell in December to touch its lowest level in nearly 10.5 years as investment in both public and private projects declined, suggesting the sector would continue to struggle this year as federal stimulus spending tapered off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction spending dropped 2.5 percent to an annual rate of $787.9 billion, the lowest level since July 2000. The government revised November's data to show a 0.2 percent fall, which was previously reported as a 0.4 percent increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending flat in December. For the whole of 2010, construction spending declined 10.3 percent to $814.2 billion, also the lowest since 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spending in December was weighed down by a 2.8 percent fall in investment in public projects, which reflected an 11.6 percent drop in federal construction projects. State and local government spending on construction projects fell 1.8 percent in December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investment in private construction dropped 2.2 percent in December, ending three straight months of gains. Spending on private home building tumbled 4.1 percent, with private nonresidential outlays dipping 0.5 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home building and the construction of structures were minor contributions to fourth-quarter gross domestic product growth.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MANY people would dream of being fawned over by Renee Zellweger. Not, apparently, Raphael De Niro.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One recent Wednesday morning at the Greenwich Hotel -- the understated chic celebrity magnet that Mr. De Niro helped his father, Robert, open in 2008 -- Ms. Zellweger leapt from her couch when she spotted him. She hugged him. She introduced him to her boyfriend, Bradley Cooper, and to Mr. Cooper's parents. She ticked off prices of various apartments for sale that Mr. De Niro, a real estate broker, had e-mailed to her. Then she smiled and gushed, ''You know your stuff.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. De Niro was unfailingly polite but all business. He chatted briefly and moved on with a tour of Manhattan real estate that had played a major role in his life: the SoHo loft his grandmother renovated in the late 1960s; the once-drug-infested playground near where he grew up and where he now takes his toddler son, Nicholas; the Mercer Street building where he made one of his first sales; Tribeca Grill, the restaurant his dad created in 1990, which helped transform the neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each downtown block, it seemed, had a story: climbing up the water tower on the roof of his father's Hudson Street loft building; bringing his G.I. Joe figures to his grandfather's studio on West Broadway, where he played among easels, stacks of books by Joseph Conrad and Brendan Behan, and a pair of squawking green Amazon parrots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's exactly the way it was,'' Mr. De Niro said as he walked among the paintbrushes, canvases and old-school kitchen, which the family has preserved as a kind of shrine since his grandfather Robert De Niro Sr. died in 1993.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the restaurant, where Grandpa's moody paintings still hang, he said: ''We had a lot of family meals and birthdays here. We still do.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Enough nostalgia. Mr. De Niro headed uptown to show off some of his newer listings. In the six years since he got his broker's license, he has sold $600 million in properties, landing among the top 10 sellers each year at Prudential Douglas Elliman, one of the city's largest firms. Next month, his 11-person team -- which includes his wife, Claudine DeMatos, and two De Niro cousins -- is expected to make the company's top 5.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a real estate market where infighting and lawsuits are standard tools of combat, Mr. De Niro, at 34, has emerged from the recession as the broker of choice for downtown developers and high-profile clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Plenty of rival brokers attribute Mr. De Niro's success to his last name, saying many of his sales began with referrals that his father or Elliman's top management had handed him. But connections alone cannot explain multiple eight-figure deals when similar properties sit idle for months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. De Niro, a cigarette smoker more introspective than gregarious, made many of his sales in the stomach-churning real estate days after the collapse of <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span>. He refused to share the names of clients, but they include megalomaniacal financiers who spend years waffling over purchases, boldface names who bring entourages on apartment tours and temperamental celebrities (Naomi Campbell, a former companion of his father's, was one).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, he acknowledged, his father's stardom has opened doors, and sellers and buyers alike often ask him for favors like tickets to the Tribeca Film Festival, of which Robert De Niro was a co-founder. But now, he said, he is largely operating in a stratosphere where people are unmoved by fame.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People can say whatever they want, but at the end of the day, no one is buying a $10 million apartment because my dad is Robert De Niro,'' he said. ''Many of them have more money than my dad.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His dad, for what it's worth, says he always tries to help his son. ''I put him in touch with people,'' Robert De Niro said. ''Sometimes they don't even call him back.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several early skeptics who dismissed Raphael De Niro's credentials have become fans. Developers including Steve Witkoff, who converted the Cipriani building at 55 Wall Street, and Richard Born, who built the Richard Meier towers on Manhattan's West Side, count on him for his habits of arriving five minutes early to appointments, returning their calls faster than anyone else and playing down his pedigree.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Anybody can be out there selling a home when times are good,'' said Gerard Longo, another major developer, for whom Mr. De Niro has sold at least $80 million in condominiums over the past two years. ''He has clearly become a go-to guy in tough times.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE De Niros never had a portfolio to rival the Trumps, or the blended fortunes of the Tishmans and the Speyers, but real estate runs deep in De Niro blood. The family, Raphael De Niro said, talked about real estate as ''an art, like finding jewels where people may not have found them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Driving through the still-sleepy downtown streets that Wednesday morning, Mr. De Niro talked about how his father's parents were involved in the conversion of SoHo from a manufacturing district into an artists' haven decades ago. His grandmother Virginia Admiral, who lived and taught art classes in the loft she renovated at Spring and Lafayette Streets, he recalled, ''would always say that all great fortunes were built on real estate.'' His great-uncle Jack DeNiro, often called by the family ''Jack of All Trades,'' worked in commercial and residential real estate here and in Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Raphael's mother, the actress Diahnne Abbott, renovated the West Village town house the family bought in the 1970s, removing ugly metal cabinets and painting over lime-green walls. Robert De Niro had transformed a raw two-story space at the top of 110 Hudson Street, and he was buying up a series of buildings in TriBeCa that he converted to restaurants, offices and, eventually, the hotel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Raphael was 10 in 1986 when he moved to Manhattan -- to that ivy-covered town house -- from what he remembers as the idyllic streets of Brentwood, Calif. When he talks about this, Mr. De Niro's face tightens. He describes moving back to New York City, commuting on the subway uptown to the Bank Street Grammar School, and being ''thrown into the fire.'' He hesitates before describing how he remembered New York City in the 1980s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was dirty,'' he said. ''It was loud. There was a lot of drug use. There were a lot of murders.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His parents, and his paternal grandparents, were divorced, but he had a cocoon of relatives whose homes formed ''a huge triangle.'' He lived on one corner of the triangle with his mother and sister, Drena De Niro, in the town house near the James J. Walker Park. He headed to SoHo to run errands for his grandmother while she was teaching, or to play at his grandfather's studio, filled with art and poetry. The third point of the triangle was his father's growing TriBeCa empire: Raphael still remembers conversations about how the bar for Tribeca Grill should look, and about the design of offices for film companies at 375 Greenwich Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(He and Ms. DeMatos, whom he met through a nightclub owner in 2004 and married in the Bahamas in 2008, live a few blocks up Greenwich, in a 2,500-square-foot apartment they bought for $2.9 million in 2009; they are expecting their second child in March.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The De Niros were always wealthy, but Raphael always worked. From age 10, he helped set up tables at street fairs. As a teenager, he folded and unfolded rugs at a store on Bleecker Street. He briefly was a doorman at a building in the East 70s, until residents found out his father's identity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There also were somewhat more glamorous jobs, though Mr. De Niro said that ''seeing it from my perspective as a kid didn't make it that glamorous.'' He glued clamshells onto a set for the 1993 movie ''A Bronx Tale,'' which his father directed. He was a production assistant on ''Witness to the Mob,'' a 1998 television movie about Salvatore (''Sammy the Bull'') Gravano, which his father produced. He appeared in films starring his father, like ''Awakenings'' and ''Raging Bull.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chuck Low, an actor, a downtown developer and a friend of Robert De Niro's, said he thought Raphael could succeed as a professional actor, but knew that he was not interested. In 1995, Mr. Low took him, instead, to a Wall Street trading floor; Mr. De Niro shakes his head at the recollection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There was something about it I didn't like,'' he said. ''I come from a world of artists and hippies and liberals.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he was younger, he was tormented by the New York tabloids.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1991, when he was 15, newspapers reported his arrest for spraying graffiti on an N train in the Canal Street station. Asked about the incident, Mr. De Niro said his juvenile record was sealed and should never have been published, adding, ''I was totally a victim of my circumstances.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New York Post reported in 1998 that he got into a fistfight outside the nightclub Veruka, and four years later that he got angry at a friend for spending too much time in the bathroom at Wye Bar. ''I was never arrested; I was never convicted of anything,'' he said of these episodes. ''I was in the wrong place at the wrong time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through what Mr. Low called Raphael's ''growing pains,'' the young man started thinking more seriously about real estate (he had taken courses on the subject at New York University before dropping out). When Mr. De Niro talked about properties, Mr. Low recalled, he ''asked the right questions.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN 2003, Mr. De Niro started helping his father with plans for the Greenwich Hotel. Mr. Born, a partner on the project, said Raphael back then seemed to be ''a little bit of a wild kid'' and he at first thought of him as ''our partner's son who initially wanted to sit in on meetings.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then the younger De Niro started asking questions. Why would the hotel ask movie stars paying $500 a night to pay for incidentals like minibar snacks? Why not provide a professional gym rather than a typical hotel treadmill and weight stand, given that many guests had to stay in shape as part of their profession?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He clearly knows a lot of celebrities and understands their lifestyle,'' said Mr. Born, adding that he started finding the son's input ''materially beneficial.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. De Niro began thinking about becoming a broker. In 2004, he met Gary Cannatta, an executive vice president of Prudential Douglas Elliman, through a friend over drinks. Mr. Cannatta encouraged Mr. De Niro to get his broker's license and hired him later that year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His first exclusive listing was 303 Mercer Street, a three-bedroom, two-bath apartment owned by the model Carmen Kass, the girlfriend of a good friend. Mr. De Niro sold it for $1.65 million, which he said was less than the $1.8 million asking price but more than what Ms. Kass had paid, which was about $900,000. Also in 2005, he helped the magician David Blaine find a pied-a-terre in Chinatown for $1.675 million, which Mr. Blaine said in an interview was ''exactly what I needed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On his first anniversary at Prudential Douglas Elliman, Dottie Herman, the chief executive, wrote him a personal note: ''I couldn't be prouder to have someone like you in our company.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. De Niro was gracious but cautious. He initially turned down Ms. Herman's request to appear in Avenue magazine, and he had passed up the chance to represent his father on a 2004 deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers started seeking him out. Mr. Born, who had met Mr. De Niro while working on the hotel, asked him in May 2008 to find a buyer for a 12-room unfinished duplex penthouse at 166 Perry Street. The sale closed last March for $14.8 million (far from the asking price of $24 million for the completed apartment, but a rare luxury sale at the time). ''He's the guy who pulls someone out of a hat,'' Mr. Born said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, what people in the industry say is most impressive about Mr. De Niro is how his career thrived as the market tanked with the economy in 2007 and 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Longo, who converted the Pearline Soap Factory in TriBeCa into condominiums, said he was hesitant, at first, to work with Mr. De Niro. He could not imagine how anyone, never mind a relative neophyte, could sell eight lavish 3,000-square-foot spaces in the stagnant climate of early 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By late 2009, Mr. De Niro had sold them all, mainly to finance executives. The prices were discounted 15 percent to 35 percent from the original asking price, according to StreetEasy.com. Justin Timberlake bought one of the apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So when Mr. Longo finished the nearby Fairchild apartment building at 55 Vestry Street in April 2009, he enlisted Mr. De Niro to sell its 21 apartments, most priced from $2.5 million to $5 million. Mr. De Niro has sold 18. The average discount has been 10.2 percent, according to StreetEasy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Longo said he most admired Mr. De Niro's emphasis on making the buildings ''a part of the fabric of the community.'' He had Mr. Longo rent a booth at the Tribeca Film Festival to advertise the project and donate money to Tribeca Partners, which cleans up neighborhood streets. He also supplied buyers with information about local day care centers. ''No one was moving property, and he clearly was,'' Mr. Longo said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NOW, Mr. De Niro is moving uptown, working stretches of Midtown, the Upper East and Upper West Sides and the ''gold coast'' apartments ringing Central Park. While driving north, he explained that ''$10-million-plus buyers want to be uptown.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the <span class="companylink">Time Warner</span> Center, Mr. De Niro has a listing for a 4,800-square-foot apartment on the 76th floor with five bathrooms (asking price: $38 million). He was also selling an apartment two floors below -- that has been taken off the market -- with 3,000 square feet, three bathrooms and a view that is ''almost like being in an airplane'' (asking price: $18.5 million).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Standing in the silent halls of the sprawling 74th-floor space, Mr. De Niro pointed out the reservoir in Central Park and the bridges on the horizon that looked like Tinkertoy constructs; and, to the north, the seven-bedroom penthouse at the Park Laurel that he sold a year ago for $24 million (it was listed for $28 million).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These are never easy sells; with some high-end clients, he said, ''you have to swallow your pride.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The son does not much resemble his father, but sometimes, when he is talking, or not, De Niro expressions familiar from the big screen appear in his face. Raphael said the two men talk nearly every day and ''have traveled the world extensively together'' -- they are clearly very close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The elder Mr. De Niro said he did not push his son toward or away from real estate. ''I was very careful not to say anything to influence him,'' he said. ''As a parent, the most important thing is that he's happy with what he's doing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The younger Mr. De Niro can never be sure, of course, how much sellers -- or buyers -- care about his name. But these days, when he appears in the tabloids, it is almost always about real estate.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PRICES in the New York real estate market may rise and fall, and trends in housing may come and go, but one number has remained largely unaffected: the 6 percent broker commission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But lately that figure is under attack by buyers and sellers looking to save money in a tough economy, and by an array of alternative real estate business models that offer an a la carte menu of services to clients willing to do some of the work themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For as little as a few hundred dollars a month, sellers can pay an agent to post their listing on broker databases and to handle some of the negotiating. And agents -- even those from larger firms -- may settle for 5 percent, or occasionally 4 percent, to get a deal done.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide, the average commission in 2009 was 5.36 percent, according to data collected by Real Trends, a real estate research firm, indicating that there is room for negotiation. ''The standard 6 percent went out the window a long time ago,'' said Steve Murray, the editor of Real Trends. The New York City market is no different from the national one, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, many agents defend the 6 percent commission, saying that for that amount, a full-service broker will land a higher price, market a property more comprehensively, and insulate sellers from the often emotional process of negotiating and closing a sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, as Mr. Murray said, ''For certain kinds of property at certain times, New York City brokers are cutting their commission to get a deal like everyone else.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many brokers are reluctant to speak publicly about commissions; representatives from Halstead Property, <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span> and Prudential Douglas Elliman declined to discuss the topic. But it is hardly a secret that an agent may accept a 5 percent listing if the seller is a repeat customer, a friend or family member, or buying through the agent as well as selling. That lower number is also more common when the agent does not have to split the commission with a buyer's broker, or for properties in the multimillion-dollar range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''At a certain price point, 6 percent just feels vulgar,'' said Kathy Braddock, a founder of Rutenberg Realty. ''I would say there's negotiability in the higher numbers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like many agents, Ms. Braddock emphasized that there were no hard and fast rules as to when a lower commission may be offered, but she said market conditions and a listing's appeal played large roles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not only about price point,'' she said. ''It also depends on how difficult a property is to sell.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another factor is what percentage of the commission the listing agent has to hand over to his or her employer; at large firms, less experienced or less productive agents may not pocket even half of the commission they earn. So for a $1 million property, a 6 percent commission of $60,000 split first with a buyer's broker and then an employer may mean the selling agent earns $15,000. And that's before expenses like marketing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rutenberg Realty follows a different model, with agents paying $99 per month to be part of the company, then $1,000 on deals involving properties that sell for $1.5 million or less and $2,000 for sales above that amount. This arrangement gives agents more flexibility to set their own commissions, since they don't have to get approval from a manager, Ms. Braddock said, though she stressed that Rutenberg does not consider itself a ''cutting commissions'' firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doug Heddings, who started the Heddings Property Group in 2009 after working at Prudential Douglas Elliman, says commissions ''have always been negotiable.'' But now that he is an independent broker, he said, he has more freedom to set his fee than when he worked for a large firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Heddings sees the 6 percent commission as justified by the money and time he spends marketing a property. And, he said, he is more likely to cut a deal on his commission during the negotiating process to bridge a gap between the buyer and the seller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If we're $10,000 or $15,000 apart,'' he said, ''I'll do what I can with a commission to make sure a deal happens.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the sticky wickets in any discussion of commissions is that legally, the industry cannot mandate a 6 percent commission because it would be price fixing, a violation of antitrust laws. But Hall F. Willkie, the president of Brown Harris Stevens, said 6 percent was fair, given increasing marketing costs and the complexities of navigating hurdles like co-op board approvals. He also pointed out that agents earn a commission only when a property sells -- and that this process can take a year or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Brokers are not paid for their marketing costs,'' Mr. Willkie said. ''They're not paid for their time. They're paid for results.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, for some sellers, a commission of tens of thousands of dollars to sell a property seems too steep, especially as they cannot expect to make as big a profit as they might have a few years ago -- if any at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Debra Pohl and her husband, Daniel, opted to list their two-bedroom Morningside Heights apartment last January with an agent who offered an alternative to the standard commission. The agent, Keith Burkhardt, the president of the Burkhardt Group, charged the Pohls a flat rate of $1,000 to submit their listing to real estate databases. The couple handled all the open houses, showings and deal negotiation themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although they advertised that they would pay a buyer's agent a 2.5 percent commission, all of their offers came from people who were not working with brokers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We sold our place for $520,000,'' Ms. Pohl said. ''At 6 percent, that would've been over $30,000, and we did it for $1,000, so the savings was really, really important to us.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Pohl said she and her husband had sold a previous home in New Jersey themselves but decided to list their apartment with Mr. Burkhardt because at the time, Web sites like StreetEasy did not allow for-sale-by-owner listings. It has since changed its policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said she did not believe that a full-service agent could have secured a higher price -- one of the main arguments brokers make to sellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We ended up selling our apartment for slightly more than the bank evaluated it at,'' she said, ''so we feel we did pretty well. That tells me that we couldn't have gotten more with a broker.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Pohls also worked with Mr. Burkhardt last year when they bought an apartment for $750,000 on the Upper West Side. They went with him then because he offers buyers a rebate of up to two-thirds of his commission, based on a similar self-service model. Clients search for apartments and visit open houses on their own, putting Mr. Burkhardt's name down as their broker, and he helps out by booking other appointments and offering advice during negotiations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, Mr. Burkhardt considers himself mostly a buyer's broker, describing his niche as that subset of real estate enthusiasts who are glued to sites like StreetEasy and don't need a lot of hand-holding while visiting Sunday open houses, a task that can take up a lot of a broker's time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They're doing, let's say 60 percent of the research themselves,'' he said, ''and they want to be compensated for that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He acknowledged, however, that setups like his had yet to catch on in a big way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People like to complain about broker commissions,'' he said, ''but they're afraid to break ranks with the status quo and go with a firm or a model that is different than what everybody accepts.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another company offering a hybrid service is RealDirect, which charges sellers $395 per month, or a 1 percent commission, to distribute a listing to major real estate databases; owners handle open houses and showings themselves. Sellers can pay a 2 percent commission for what RealDirect calls ''broker-managed service,'' including pricing and staging advice, and the handling of negotiations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doug Perlson, the chief executive of RealDirect, said 3 of the 13 apartments listed through the company, which started last summer, had sold or were in contract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of those properties is a one-bedroom Greenwich Village apartment owned by Colleen Gray, which is scheduled to close in mid-February. The listing price was $920,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Gray said she listed her apartment with RealDirect in late October after having tried to sell it herself for about a month. She went with RealDirect because she did not feel her previous real estate agents had earned their commissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have a very desirable apartment, in a good building, and I work from home,'' Ms. Gray said, explaining that these factors made it easier for her to opt for a no-frills agency. ''I was available at the drop of a hat for a showing. Realtors, on the other hand, have their own schedule.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RealDirect offers clients some professional backup, an advantage over the lonely sale-by-owner transaction if things go amiss (Mr. Perlson is a member of the Real Estate Board of New York). However, the 3 percent commission that sellers often offer buyers' agents to encourage showings can take a bite out of the potential for significant savings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">D. J. Jaffe, a retired advertising executive, is selling the two-bedroom apartment at West 27th Street that he has owned for 20 years. He chose RealDirect for reasons similar to Ms. Gray's: he has the time -- and the enthusiasm -- to do some of the work himself. He is asking $899,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At an open house in early January, Mr. Jaffe welcomed a steady stream of prospective buyers, talking up the apartment's features (which walls could be altered, where a second bathroom could be added) and the neighborhood's appeal (good transportation, a Whole Foods), as well as playing with visitors' dogs (the building is pet-friendly).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All three sellers who declined the standard commission model said anyone considering this option should be prepared to invest a lot of time in the sale, and to develop a thick skin for comments made during showings and the back-and-forth of negotiations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Murray of Real Trends said he believed cultural reticence about haggling had helped to preserve the traditional broker commission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Will we see more options? Yes,'' he said. ''Will consumers take advantage of them? Some will. But I think a lot of Americans don't have the personal skills or even the desire to negotiate a deal.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let's Make A Deal: SELLERS may be able to reduce the broker's commission. Here are some strategies:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interview several agents before signing a listing agreement, and ask if they will accept less than 6 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the buyer does not have an agent, negotiate a reduced commission -- for instance 5 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Engage the same agent to sell your current home and to buy your next one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Choose an agency that offers fewer services and do some -- or most -- of the work yourself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Use an independent agent who does not have to split commissions with a large company. SUSAN STELLIN</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. LiMandri, 45, is the commissioner of the Department of Buildings, which oversees nearly a million properties in New York City, by enforcing various building codes and laws. He was appointed in 2008, after the resignation of Patricia J. Lancaster, following a series of construction accidents, including a crane collapse in Manhattan that killed seven people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q The department just released its 2010 annual report. Can you discuss some of the numbers?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A There are 975,000 buildings and properties in New York City and we have 1,109 employees, 337 of whom are inspectors. We performed 335,449 inspections last year; issued 136,294 construction permits and 1,517 new building permits and 67,069 violations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What many people don't realize is that we do about 450,000 plan reviews a year. Last year it was 457,375. That rivals some of the largest architectural firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Do you have more or fewer inspectors now?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Slightly fewer, through attrition and budget cuts. But we're doing more with less and using technology to be more efficient.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q How so?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A We've been trying to make it easier for people to get permits, to do plan reviews, online. Electricians can go online as of last year: they put in their ID numbers, pay for the permit online and print it. Construction permits will also go online this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other piece is dealing with plans online. We hope to pilot that by the end of this year. You would submit your plans -- the simplest plans, not the big complicated ones. You open an account with us, send it to us electronically. We look at it when we're available -- we might ask questions or note objections -- and e-mail it back to you.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Could this work with the big developers?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A The number of large buildings that get built every year is like 200 to 300. So if you are a large developer/owner like the Rudins or the Resnicks, you're doing these kinds of filings on a regular basis. Instead of hiring someone to drop off stuff for us to look at, they can save transaction time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q How much time?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A We saw that when they went online for electrical permits, the processing time went from days or weeks to minutes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Getting back to the annual report, what does it tell us about the city's recovery?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A It's in pockets. Permits for new buildings and major alterations fell around 19 percent last year, to 13,000 from 16,000. But permits for small-scale alterations -- like moving a wall -- rose 6 percent, to nearly 103,000. People are still doing smaller work, and that drives the economy as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We're starting to see pockets of demolitions. We just had seven or eight sites in the last couple of weeks. When you see demolitions come back, it's a leading indicator that development is coming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, in Manhattan there are four or five large sites, where maybe they slowed construction, that are starting to pick up. It's the heart of the winter so it's going to be slow anyway, but we're hoping that the spring will bring a set of new buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q It's been over two years since you took office. What are some of your biggest accomplishments?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A We've been working on transforming this department -- making it more accountable and instilling confidence in our training programs. We put G.P.S. tracking on our 337 inspectors, so we know where our people are. We conducted a facade safety initiative, and we investigated illegally converted apartments. We used Craigslist and posed as tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Have you been able to curb construction accidents?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A We had a reduction in 2010 from the year before by about 28 percent. Clearly there's been less large-scale construction, but also I am very satisfied that the industry has heard us and responded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contractors are using cocoon-netting systems to protect the top four floors during the very early stages of construction. These innovative systems prevent people from falling, as well as falling debris. I'm hoping it will become a city standard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building a building is complex, and there are a lot of people you depend on to do it well, and it takes just one of them not to do their job for things to go awry. Our job is to make sure that they put safety ahead of profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Let's talk about some of the new regulations for this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A The big thing that's coming down the pike is the Greener, Greater Buildings Plan, which will rank buildings by energy efficiency. Owners have to benchmark their buildings -- if they're over 50,000 square feet -- and upload information about utility bills into a federal Web site by May 1. The next step is that every 10 years they will have to go through an audit process.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moguls and mansions, conquests and prizes, prestige and social status - this is the language of the blood sport that is big-money New York City real estate. And the word ''trophy,'' as in ''trophy apartment,'' ''trophy building'' or ''trophy sale,'' gets tossed around a lot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the working definition has become somewhat slippery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are those who contend that a trophy property costs at least $20 million. And that price tends to be the benchmark used when sales, like the recent one of a town house on West 10th Street for $20 million, are reported in the media and talked over by those who like to talk about these things.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michael Vargas, a principal and a co-founder of the Vanderbilt Appraisal Company, said he defined trophy properties as those in the top 1 percent of sales, which in Manhattan means $10 million and up. He added that because $10 million sales became almost ''commonplace'' before the housing crash ''and no longer generated any sense of amazement, the $20 million-and-higher sale was generating the market buzz.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Vargas said a trophy property had to be ''rare, special and coveted by many, like a Picasso.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On that point there is widespread agreement. But if you ask real estate brokers to put a price tag on a trophy, the answer is all over the place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is what Donna Olshan, the president of Olshan Realty, found in a recent survey of colleagues from other firms asked for their answer ''if a customer walked into your office today and asked, 'I want to buy a trophy property, what will it cost?' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The responses, from 16 of the city's top-selling brokers and 3 appraisers, ranged from $10 million to $45 million. Most gave higher prices for uptown (and for town houses) than for downtown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One said a buyer would pay $40 million for a trophy apartment uptown but $25 million downtown; another said $12 million for an uptown apartment and $20 million for an uptown penthouse. One said $25 million for an uptown apartment and $15 million for downtown; another specifically said $44 million, which was also the closing price of the most expensive city property sold in 2010, the Duke Semans mansion on Fifth Avenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And interviews with five of the city's top-selling brokers revealed that what makes a trophy can be quite subjective:''It's something I can have but no one else can; I own what you want.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's the one penthouse.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's custom-designed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The architect makes it a trophy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The address makes it a trophy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My neighbors are famous.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Famous people once lived in my trophy apartment.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a trophy because it's an apartment in 15 Central Park West.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(Or, it's not a trophy in 15 Central Park West because it is not the $40 million penthouse sold late last year by one of the condominium's developers, William Lie Zeckendorf.)Dolly Lenz of Prudential Douglas Elliman, one of the best-known brokers in luxury real estate, said she could not put a price on a trophy. She said that a trophy was ''without peer,'' and that if an apartment was identical to another, even if it was in what many considered a trophy building, it could not be a trophy. She closed one of the biggest deals of 2010, the $31.5 million sale of a penthouse at Superior Ink in the West Village, designed by Robert A. M. Stern and often described as a trophy building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ms. Lenz said one of her current listings, a penthouse at the Ice House condominium in TriBeCa owned by Martha Stewart's daughter, Alexis, is a trophy - even with an asking price of under $10 million - because there is no other apartment like it. (And the $9.5 million asking price, even though it has been cut several times, would put that property close to Mr. Vargas's $10 million yardstick.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paula Del Nunzio of Brown Harris Stevens, who in 2006 handled the $53 million sale of the Harkness Mansion on the Upper East Side, the most expensive sale of a single New York City residence on record, said a trophy was mainly ''defined in a buyer's mind.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It depends, she said, on ''the incredible assets the buyer would have - great space, outdoor space, great high ceilings in salons and rooms, a great location.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked if one could find a trophy in Manhattan for, say, $5 million, Ms. Del Nunzio sounded befuddled and said she doubted one could find those assets in anything under $10 million. ''I guess you could have a trophy one-bedroom,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Sharon E. Baum, a broker specializing in high-end properties for <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, said she had seen properties for under $10 million that she considered trophies. ''Trophy for 99 percent of the people means expensive,'' she said. ''But it's like everything else, money doesn't necessarily create taste.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Burger, the top-selling broker for Brown Harris Stevens in 2010, said apartments could be trophies simply by virtue of their address. ''Yes, at 820 Fifth or 2 East 67th, every apartment is identical, every floor is identical,'' he said. ''But in those cases there is no other building like it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Howard Margolis, the Prudential Douglas Elliman broker who handled the sale of a $33.18 million penthouse at the Trump International Hotel and Tower at 1 Central Park West last March, said he would find it difficult to consider anything a trophy that cost less than $4,000 per square foot, or $20 million over all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michele Kleier, a co-president of Gumley Haft Kleier, a boutique firm specializing in luxury properties, said that before the housing crisis she would have put the price of a trophy at $25 million and higher, but that she now put it at $15 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Answering the question she posed to the other brokers, Ms. Olshan, who along with her survey produced a detailed report on the 2010 sales of residences for $10 million and higher, said she firmly believed trophies started at $20 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The definition of a trophy property may be debatable,'' Ms. Olshan added. ''But one thing is certain: You have to have trophy money to buy a trophy property.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- New claims for jobless benefits surged last week as snowstorms in some parts of the United States kept workers at home, but the underlying trend pointed to a gradual labor market improvement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initial claims for state unemployment benefits jumped 51,000 to a seasonally adjusted 454,000, the highest weekly total since late October, the Labor Department said on Thursday. That was the largest weekly increase since September 2005. The rise exceeded economists' expectations for a gain to 405,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The four-week moving average of unemployment claims, a better measure of underlying trends, rose 15,750 to 428,750 last week, implying a gradual labor market recovery that could compel the Federal Reserve to complete its $600 billion bond-buying program aimed at bolstering the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'll buy that it can be blamed on the weather. But it does show that the recovery is growing in fits and starts,'' said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Va.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report from the Commerce Department showed that orders for long-lasting manufactured goods dropped 2.5 percent in December, largely because of a nearly 100 percent drop in civilian aircraft orders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists had expected orders to rise 1.5 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orders excluding transportation rose 0.5 percent, however, and a proxy for business spending increased 1.4 percent, indicating that the economic recovery was still gaining some momentum, though not enough to help the labor market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Reserve officials on Wednesday acknowledged the improvement in the economic picture, but said the rate of the recovery remained ''insufficient to bring about a significant improvement in labor market conditions.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of people still receiving benefits under regular state programs after an initial week of aid increased 94,000, to 3.99 million, in the week ended Jan 15. The numbers were above market expectations for a decline to 3.85 million and included the week for the household survey from which the unemployment rate is derived.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The previous week's number for the so-called continuing claims was revised up to 3.90 million from 3.86 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of people on emergency unemployment benefits rose 63,886, to 3.78 million, in the week ended Jan. 8, the latest week for which data is available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A total of 9.4 million people were claiming unemployment benefits during that period under all programs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the latest snapshot of the housing sector, contracts for pending sales of previously owned homes rose faster than expected in December after the previous month's sales were revised lower, according to data from a real estate trade group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors' index of pending home sales, which is based on contracts signed in December, was up 2 percent, to 93.7, from a downwardly revised reading of 91.9 in November.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists polled by Reuters had expected pending home sales to rise 1 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index has risen in five of the last six months, though it is still 4.2 percent lower than the 97.8 level of a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Yun, the association's chief economist, said the latest sales figures suggested that activity was close to what he called a healthy level above five million units annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Modest gains in the labor market and the improving economy are creating a more favorable backdrop for buyers,'' Mr. Yun said.</p>
