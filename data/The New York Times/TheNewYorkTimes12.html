</div><div class="author">By JULIE SATOW </div><div>1138 words</div><div>13 October 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Benefiting from falling commercial rents and recession-driven demand, discount clothing stores are emerging from the fringes of New York real estate and opening branches along fashionable avenues and in luxury developments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leading the charge is the off-price retailer TJ Maxx, with new stores under construction on East 59th Street and on West 57th Street near the <span class="companylink">Time Warner</span> Center. The company is also in discussions for a third location, at 14 Wall Street, according to brokers who did not want to be quoted by name because the lease was not yet completed. The company had a single store in Manhattan, at Sixth Avenue and 18th Street, until last year when it opened an outpost at 100th Street and Columbus Avenue on the Upper West Side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now is the right time for our company to be expanding,'' said Sherry Lang, a spokeswoman for TJ Maxx, which has 890 stores nationwide. ''We have done better than other retailers in the past one-and-one-half years, and we do think that value is here to stay.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other off-price retailers, which buy excess inventory from designer brands, are expanding in the city. <span class="companylink">Century 21 Department Stores</span> announced plans to open its second Manhattan store in 50 years next fall, while Syms is building a flagship on Fifth Avenue in what the company's chief executive, Marcy Syms, said was its most expensive lease ever. Nordstrom Rack opened its first Manhattan store, in Union Square, this summer, while Bloomingdale's outlets and Saks Off 5th are also on the hunt for a presence in the city, according to brokers who are showing them spaces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer demand for off-price retail has soared, in part because of an improvement in the quality and variety of clothes they offer. This better selection is largely because of the lackluster sales at many top fashion houses. As the top end of the market struggles, designers are stuck with large quantities of unsold inventory that they pass down to the discounters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of top designers who are now selling excess inventory to <span class="companylink">TJX Companies</span>, the parent of TJ Maxx, has jumped nearly 25 percent, said Richard E. Jaffe, a managing director of the research firm <span class="companylink">Stifel Nicolaus</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The off-price business model works,'' Mr. Jaffe said. ''It is a sound, well-grounded business, and it plays an essential role in the apparel food chain.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The popularity of fast-fashion stores like <span class="companylink">H&amp;M</span> and Forever 21, with their ability to deliver the latest trends quickly, is also helping make off-price shopping more acceptable to consumers. Fast fashion has created ''a leveling of the whole shopping experience, with people mixing and matching price points,'' said Margaret A. Gilliam, the president of the retail consulting firm Gilliam &amp; Company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Walking into the old-time 99-cent stores was never appealing,'' said Jeffrey D. Roseman, an executive vice president and principal at the real estate firm Newmark Knight Frank. ''But fast-fashion stores have made discount shopping sexy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forever 21, for example, recently announced it had signed a six-month lease at the Takashimaya Building on Fifth Avenue between 54th and 55th Streets. It will be the fifth New York store for the Los Angeles-based company, which has been ramping up in the city, recently opening a 91,000-square-foot flagship in Times Square.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is quite a trend now toward off-price stores,'' said Robert K. Futterman, chief executive of the real estate broker Robert K. Futterman &amp; Associates. Mr. Futterman, who is working with several discount retailers to find expansion space, said it was once the case that owners of luxury developments would consider only retail stores that catered to the tastes of their residents. But now, ''landlords have adjusted their expectations and no longer have a problem leasing to discount retail,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Syms is another off-price brand that is doing well. The company, which acquired Filene's Basement -- itself a discounter -- for $55 million out of bankruptcy last year, is creating a new brand, fbSY (pronounced fib-SEE). Ms. Syms said the company hoped it the new brand would ''compete for the attention of shoppers with disposable incomes who are attracted to trends.'' To drive home its point, fbSY is opening a 34,000-square-foot flagship at Fifth Avenue and 43rd Street. Ms. Syms declined to discuss the exact terms, but the asking rent for the space was $400 a square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Syms also recently signed a long-term lease at the corner of West 80th Street and Broadway, adjacent to a Filene's Basement, and last month it opened a Syms Tailored and Tux men's store. The two stores will be joined, creating a blocklong three-level location.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There has been an increase in competition with the H&amp;Ms and Forever 21 stores, and a blurring of the lines in consumers' minds about discount,'' Ms. Syms said. ''This is our chance to compete.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lower rents are helping. ''Rents have fallen as much as 20 percent to 30 percent from previous market highs,'' said Peter Ripka, a partner in the real estate brokerage firm Ripco, ''allowing retailers that work on lesser margins to consider new areas of Manhattan.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Landlords have also changed their tune. Many building owners have ''stopped dreaming about luxury,'' Mr. Ripka said. ''Landlords who in the past would have held out for a Prada or Barney's Co-op realize that isn't happening, so they will take a TJ Maxx or Duane Reade.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The willingness of landlords to accept discount retail may have played a role in the news that Century 21 will take over 61,000 square feet that <span class="companylink">Barnes &amp; Noble</span> is vacating at West 66th Street and Broadway, near Lincoln Center. The privately held company, which has stores in Brooklyn, Queens, Long Island and New Jersey, has spent five decades on Cortlandt Street, directly across from the World Trade Center site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the context of what is happening in our economy, off-price retail stores are optimized for growth,'' said Susan Reda, the editor of Stores Media. The company, which is the publishing arm of the National Retail Federation, recently named Syms the fastest-growing retail chain in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you look at the few retailers that are succeeding in this economy, it is those stores that offer discounts,'' Bill Miller, vice president of corporate retail solutions at <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>, said. ''And now, this trend is being reflected in the real estate they are leasing.''</p>

</div><div class="author">By MICHAEL POWELL and MOTOKO RICH   </div><div>2814 words</div><div>13 October 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is not what a recovery is supposed to look like.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Atlanta, the <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> tower, the tallest in the Southeast, is nearly a fifth vacant, and bank officials just wrestled a rent cut from the developer. In Cherry Hill, N.J., 10 percent of the houses on the market are so-called short sales, in which sellers ask for less than they owe lenders. And in Arizona, in sun-blasted desert subdivisions, owners speak of hours cut, jobs lost and meals at soup kitchens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Less than a month before November elections, the United States is mired in a grim New Normal that could last for years. That has policy makers, particularly the Federal Reserve, considering a range of ever more extreme measures, as noted in the minutes of its last meeting, released Tuesday. Call it recession or recovery, for tens of millions of Americans, there's little difference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Born of a record financial collapse, this recession has been more severe than any since the Great Depression and has left an enormous oversupply of houses and office buildings and crippling debt. The decision last week by leading mortgage lenders to freeze foreclosures, and calls for a national moratorium, could cast a long shadow of uncertainty over banks and the housing market. Put simply, the national economy has fallen so far that it could take years to climb back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The math yields somber conclusions, with implications not just for this autumn's elections but also -- barring a policy surprise or economic upturn -- for 2012 as well:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the current rate of job creation, the nation would need nine more years to recapture the jobs lost during the recession. And that doesn't even account for five million or six million jobs needed in that time to keep pace with an expanding population. Even top Obama officials concede the unemployment rate could climb higher still.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Median house prices have dropped 20 percent since 2005. Given an inflation rate of about 2 percent -- a common forecast -- it would take 13 years for housing prices to climb back to their peak, according to Allen L. Sinai, chief global economist at the consulting firm Decision Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Commercial vacancies are soaring, and it could take a decade to absorb the excess in many of the largest cities. The vacancy rate, as of the end of June, stands at 21.4 percent in Phoenix, 19.7 percent in Las Vegas, 18.3 in Dallas/Fort Worth and 17.3 percent in Atlanta, in each case higher than last year, according to the data firm CoStar Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Demand is inert. Consumer confidence has tumbled as many are afraid or unable to spend. Families are still paying off -- or walking away from -- debt. Mark Zandi, chief economist of <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics, estimates it will be the end of 2011 before the amount of income that households pay in interest recedes to levels seen before the run-up. Credit card delinquencies are rising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''No wonder Americans are pessimistic and unhappy,'' said Mr. Sinai. ''The only way we are going to get in gear is to face up to the reality that we are entering a period of austerity.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This dreary accounting should not suggest a nation without strengths. Unemployment rates have come down from their peaks in swaths of the United States, from Vermont to Minnesota to Wisconsin. Port traffic has increased, and employers have created an average of 68,111 jobs a month this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After plummeting in 2009, the stock market has spiraled up, buoying retirement accounts and perhaps the spirits of middle-class Americans. As a measure of economic health, though, that gain is overstated. Robert Reich, the former labor secretary, notes that the most profitable companies in the domestic stock indexes generate about 40 percent of their revenue from abroad.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few doubt the American economy remains capable of electrifying growth, but few expect that any time soon. ''We still have a lot of strengths, from a culture of entrepreneurship and venture capitalism, to flexible labor markets and attracting immigrants,'' said Barry Eichengreen, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley. ''But we're going to be living with the overhang of our financial and debt problems for a long, long time to come.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New shocks could push the nation into another recession or deflation. ''We are in a situation where our vulnerability to any new problem is great,'' said Carmen M. Reinhart, a professor of economics at the University of Maryland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So troubles ripple outward, as lost jobs, unsold houses and empty offices weigh down the economy and upend lives. Struggles in Arizona, New Jersey and Georgia echo broadly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Florence, Ariz.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2005, Arizona ranked, as usual, second nationally in job growth behind Nevada, its economy predicated on growth. The snowbirds came and construction boomed and land stretched endless and cheap. Then it stopped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, Arizona ranks 42nd in job growth. It has lost 287,000 jobs since the recession began, and the fall has been calamitous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Renee Wheaton, 38, sits in an old golf cart on the corner of Tangerine and Barley Roads in her subdivision in the desert, an hour south of Phoenix. Her next-door neighbor, an engineer, just lost his job. The man across the street is unemployed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her family is not doing so well either. Her husband's hours have been cut by 15 percent, leaving her family of five behind on water and credit card bills -- more or less on everything except the house and car payment. She teaches art, but that's not much in demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I say to myself 'This can't be happening to us: We saved, we worked hard and we're under tremendous stress,' '' Ms. Wheaton says. ''My husband is a very hard-working man but for the first time, he's having real trouble.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Arizona's poverty rate has jumped to 19.6 percent, the second-highest in the nation after Mississippi. The Association of Arizona Food Banks says demand has nearly doubled in the last 18 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Elliott D. Pollack, one of Arizona's foremost economic forecasters, said: ''You had an implosion of every sector needed to survive. That's not going to get better fast.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To wander exurban Pinal County, which is where Florence is located, is to find that the unemployment rate tells just half the story. Everywhere, subdivisions sit in the desert, some half-built and some dreamy wisps, like the emerald green putting green sitting amid acres of scrub and cacti. Signs offer discounts, distress sales and rent with the first and second month free.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Discounts do not help if your income is cut in half. Construction workers speak of stringing together 20-hour weeks with odd jobs, and a 45-year-old woman who was a real estate agent talks of her job making minimum wage bathing elderly patients. Many live close to the poverty line, without the conveniences they once took for granted. Pinal's unemployment rate, like that of Arizona, stands at 9.7 percent, but state officials say that the real rate rises closer to 20 percent when part-timers and those who have stopped looking for work are added in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At an elementary school near Ms. Wheaton's home, an expansion of the school's water supply was under way until thieves sneaked in at night and tore the copper pipes out of the ground to sell for scrap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five miles southwest, in Coolidge, a desert town within view of the distant Superstition Mountains, demand has tripled at Tom Hunt's food pantry. Some days he runs out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Henry Alejandrez, 60, is a roofer who migrated from Texas looking for work. ''It's gotten real bad,'' he says. ''I'm a citizen, and you're lucky if you get minimum wage.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mary Sepeda, his sister, nods. She used to drive two hours to clean newly constructed homes before they were sold. That job evaporated with the housing market. (Arizona issued 62,500 housing permits several years ago; it gave out 8,400 last year.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's getting crazy,'' she says, holding up a white plastic bag of pantry food. ''How does this end?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You put that question to Mr. Pollack, the forecaster. ''We won't recover until we absorb 80,000 empty houses and office buildings and people can borrow again,'' he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When will that be?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm forecasting recovery by 2013 to 2015,'' he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cherry Hill, N.J.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market in this bedroom community just across the border from Philadelphia never leapt to the frenzied heights of Miami Beach or Las Vegas. But even if foreclosure notices are not tacked to every other door, a malaise has settled over the market. Home prices have fallen by 16 percent since 2006, and houses now take twice as long to sell as they did five years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's enough to inflict pain on homeowners who need to sell because of a job loss or drop in income. Some are being forced to get rid of their houses in short sales, asking less than they owe on a mortgage. As of last week, 10 percent of all listings in this well-tended suburb were being offered as short sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chrysanthemums bloomed in boxes on the porch of one of those homes as a real estate broker unlocked the front door. In the kitchen, children's chores were listed neatly on an erasable white board. Dinner simmered in a Crock-Pot on the counter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were few signs of the financial distress that prompted the owners to put their four-bedroom colonial on the market for less than they paid five years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The colonial's owners, James and Patricia Furrow, bought near the top of the market in 2005 for $289,900. Mr. Furrow, 48, retired in July after 26 years as a corrections officer and supplements his pension with work as a handyman. But his income is spotty, and his wife, who works in a school cafeteria, does not earn enough to cover the mortgage on the house where they live with their three children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They have already missed a payment; they want to sell the house in hopes their lender will forgive the shortfall between their loan balance and the lower sale price. They are asking $279,900.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When we did buy, the market was still moving pretty good,'' said Mr. Furrow. ''Then it got to the point where people said it is not going to last. And of course it didn't last.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the homes being offered at distressed prices are dragging down prices for less troubled homeowners who hope to sell. And with foreclosures now in disarray, the market could be further weakened. ''Even someone who is trying to sell a normal, well-maintained house is at the mercy of these low prices,'' said Walter Bud Crane, an agent with Re/Max of Cherry Hill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the houses sit, awaiting offers that rarely materialize. According to Mr. Crane, the average number of days that homes sit on the market has nearly doubled, to 62 this year from 32 in 2005. Buyers are chary, not sure if their jobs are secure. Open houses draw sparse crowds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Camden County, where Cherry Hill sits, unemployment is near 10 percent. Several large employers have closed or conducted huge layoffs, and others have pruned hours. With Gov. Chris Christie reining in spending, government workers are jittery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate agents say it has rarely been a better time to buy: interest rates are at record lows, house prices have fallen and the selection is large.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tara Stewart-Becker, a 28-year-old financial services manager, said she and her husband would love to buy a sprawling fixer-upper just three blocks from the narrow colonial they purchased four years ago in Riverton, which backs onto the Delaware River.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a bad kitchen flood and a loan to pay for repairs has left Ms. Becker and her husband, Eric, owing more on their mortgage than the house is currently worth. Even though the couple make far more money than they did when they bought their house and could afford a larger loan and renovations, they cannot sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I would gladly take a new mortgage and stimulate the economy for the rest of my life,'' Ms. Becker said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Unfortunately, there isn't anything that a government or a bank can do,'' she added. ''You just have to settle for less and wait.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Atlanta</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long fast-growing, no-holds-barred Atlanta has burned to the ground before, figuratively and in reality, and each time it was a phoenix rising. But this recession has cut deeper than any since the Great Depression and left Atlanta's commercial and high-end condo real estate in an economic coma.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, assuming a robust growth rate, industry leaders say it could take 12 years for Atlanta to absorb excess commercial space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That one -- see it?'' Alan Wexler points to a gleaming blue tower as he drives. ''A Chicago bank took it over six months ago. Sold at a 40 percent discount.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''And over there'' -- he juts his chin at a boarded-up hotel topped by a <span class="companylink">Chick-fil-A</span> fast-food restaurant crown. ''That was going to be a condo. They just shut it down and walked away.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wexler, a wiry and peripatetic real estate data analyst, describes it all on a drive down Peachtree Road, Atlanta's posh commercial spine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He starts in the Buckhead neighborhood, which has more than two million square feet of vacant commercial space. A billboard outside one discounted condo tower promises ''New Pricing from the $290s!'' There are towers half-empty and towers in receivership. Office buildings that once sold for $85 million now retail for $35 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Approaching downtown, Mr. Wexler hits the brakes and points to an older, white marble building. ''See that one? It's the Fed Reserve. That's where they sit, look, sweat and wonder: How did we get into this mess?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's a question much on the minds and lips of residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The commercial vacancy rate in Buckhead is near 20 percent, and the Atlanta region has added jobs only at the low end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike Alexander, research division chief for the Atlanta Regional Commission, posed the question: ''When do we start to add premium jobs again?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence L. Gellerstedt III, chief executive of <span class="companylink">Cousins Properties</span>, sits in an office high atop an elegant Philip Johnson tower, with a grand view of the Atlanta commercial corridor running north. He does not see improvement on the horizon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're all wondering what gets the economy producing jobs and growth again,'' he says. ''Atlanta always was the fair-haired child of real estate growth and now, it's 'O.K., poster boy, you're getting yours.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Small banks are a particular disaster, 43 having gone under in Georgia since 2008. (Federal regulators closed 129 nationally this year, up from 25 last year.) Real estate was the beginning, the middle and the end of the troubles. In one deal, dozens of Atlanta banks invested in Merrill Ranch, a 4,508-acre tract of desert south of Phoenix.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal imploded and took a lot of banks with it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''No one was demanding documents or reading the fine print, and mortgage banks were fat and happy,'' recalls John Little, a developer. ''Well, that train couldn't keep running.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has a ringside seat on this debacle, as he sits in the office of a handsome condo complex he built in west Atlanta. He faced price discounts so deep that he decided to rent it instead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationwide banks have no interest in lending to local developers, and the regional banks are desperate for cash and calling in their loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Little got lucky; he bought out his loan and kept his property. ''Most of my generation of builders has gone under,'' he said. ''It's still spiraling out of control.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN boom times and bust, international buyers play an integral role in the Manhattan residential marketplace, stabilizing prices in lean years and driving demand when the market is ascendant. They make up an estimated 10 to 15 percent of all sales in the city almost every year, brokers say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while the number of foreign buyers largely stays the same, the players change. In the 1980s, it was the Japanese who came house-hunting in droves, while in the 1990s it was Middle Eastern investors flush with oil-profits cash or newly minted Russian tycoons who rose from the rubble of the fallen wall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last great influx of investment came from Europeans who rushed to take advantage of the record strength of the euro against the dollar in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Foreigners are once again buying in Manhattan, energizing the still-fragile market. In recent months, according to brokers and developers, the money has been just as likely to come from South America or Mexico as Europe or the Middle East.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dollar, more than anything else, drives international sales, and because it remains weak globally, New York is still a good deal for many buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jaime Gorozpe, the founder of an upscale travel agency in Mexico City, spends about 200 nights a year in hotel rooms, including 80 nights in New York City. So instead of paying more than $500 a night for a luxury hotel room in Manhattan every time he visited, he decided to invest in an apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's better to have a small place of my own than a five-star hotel,'' he said as he walked through his newly purchased one-bedroom apartment in the Centurion at 33 West 56th Street, designed by Pei Partnership Architects. He talked about where he would place a favorite Eames chair, and where he would hang some paintings that he had bought at the Gagosian Gallery. Mr. Gorozpe, 38, also enthused about a major draw of the elegant building: it's within walking distance of Central Park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For me,'' he said, ''the park is New York City.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent years, much of the new development in Midtown, whether large projects like the Setai Fifth Avenue, a 60-story hotel-condo, or smaller ones like the Centurion, with 48 apartments, has been directly marketed to foreigners. Centrally located iconic buildings like the Plaza also do well with this market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly half of the units in the Centurion -- ranging in price from nearly $2 million to $13 million -- have been sold, all but one to a foreign buyer, according to Kari Neering, an associate vice president of Rubenstein Public Relations, who is doing publicity for the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The area around the Centurion is known to brokers as the golden triangle, home to some of the city's most expensive hotels -- the Peninsula, the Four Seasons, the St. Regis -- and some of the properties that foreign buyers now find most desirable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Native New Yorkers might prefer the brownstone streets of the West Village or Park Slope, but brokers say foreigners gravitate toward the amenities and convenience of shiny new apartment towers. With little construction on the horizon because of the difficulty developers have had securing financing, some overseas buyers are eager to get it while it lasts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Midtown and the financial district are preferred neighborhoods. The hustle and bustle of Midtown in particular conforms with the image many have of the City That Never Sleeps. Proximity to Central Park, renowned restaurants and transportation is high on the wish lists of house-hunters from overseas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forces at play beyond American borders influence this market. Some countries have eased banking rules that regulate the transfer of currency, making transactions simpler. Many investors are also concerned about political instability in their own countries and view New York real estate as a safe haven.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think foreigners are coming back into the New York City market with a vengeance,'' said Khashy Eyn, the chief executive of the boutique brokerage Platinum Properties, which has opened an office in Paris to serve the New York market. Mr. Eyn says 80 percent of his business comes from overseas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Europeans, with the euro trading at 1.34 to the dollar, ''their money is worth 34 percent more now; it is a very safe bet for them,'' Mr. Eyn said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, Antonio Cosentino, an associate broker at Corcoran, said that while the international money once chased New York, New York now chases the money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cosentino, who specializes in international sales, recalled a business trip to Italy in 2007. ''We would set up in a conference room at the Four Seasons in Milan for three days and from 8 in the morning until 10 that night we would have people coming in looking to make deals,'' he said. The tab for his airfare, hotel and local advertising were picked up by the developer of a Manhattan property. ''We didn't even have time for lunch.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last November, Mr. Cosentino went on a scouting trip to Shanghai.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was a disappointment,'' he said. While he loved the city, business was slow. ''There were two main obstacles,'' he said. ''The Chinese government does not allow currency exports over a certain amount, and for those who could get around those banking rules, there were concerns about getting a visa.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many foreigners, not just the Chinese, complain about the strict enforcement of visa regulations by the United States since Sept. 11, 2001.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">China is one of the two markets that most interest Manhattan brokers. The other, India, also restricts the amount of money that can be taken out of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some wealthy Chinese and Indians have overseas bank accounts, many do not. Those without must find creative ways to put together the cash they need when they shop for properties in the United States. For instance, Mr. Cosentino says he has worked with Indian buyers who give five or six relatives $100,000 each to send out of the country -- the maximum allowed for an individual -- so they can make a down payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More and more, to reach potential clients, brokers and developers must rely on small networks of investors they have cultivated over the years rather than large trade shows or direct advertising in local markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My brokers that focus on foreign buyers tend to hyperfocus on specific countries,'' said Pamela Liebman, the chief executive of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>. Whether it is going to London to meet with private bankers or to Rio to make contacts with brokers who could lead them to clients, she said direct engagement was key.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I had one broker a couple of years ago move to Italy to work the whole Italian market,'' Ms. Liebman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One challenge for brokers and developers is convincing sometimes skeptical investors that Manhattan stands apart from the national real estate market while at the same time tamping down unrealistic expectations about the kinds of bargains that might be available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Some people think they are going to find properties going for 50 cents on the dollar in the New York market,'' said Amy Williamson, the vice president for sales at Prodigy Network, which specializes in international sales. ''That can be a problem.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daniela Sassoun, an associate broker at Corcoran whose focus is the South American market, said she recently received a call from someone who wanted ''a distressed property on Fifth Avenue going into foreclosure.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was, like, let me know and I will buy it myself,'' she joked. ''Manhattan is not Phoenix.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">International buyers often need someone to actively manage the property, overseeing everything from renovations to renting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jason Feng, a general manager of a business in Taiwan, said he had worked with Ms. Williamson to buy a two-bedroom apartment in Chelsea for his daughter when she moved to New York in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A good, patient agent makes the property purchasing process much more transparent, and thereby easier,'' he said, ''especially for a foreigner who is unfamiliar with the market.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Feng later bought a second apartment, a one-bedroom in the financial district, as an investment. For two years, he said, Ms. Williamson has helped ensure that the place is rented out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Sassoun, who often manages her clients' properties for no fee, finds that these days buyers are less interested in short-term investments. And, she said, because of the headache that securing financing has become, many buyers come armed with much more cash for down payments than in the past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recently, she added, there has been a surge of interest from Brazil and Venezuela, although for different reasons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In Brazil, it used to be very difficult to send money from a bank in Brazil to a bank in America,'' she said. As restrictions were eased, more Brazilians came to New York. It also does not hurt that the Brazilian real is trading at about 1.7 to the dollar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it helps that Manhattan real estate has remained stronger than in markets traditionally favored by South American buyers, especially Miami.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nervousness over the political situation at home can also translate into a New York apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We see a lot of capital flight, especially from Venezuela,'' Ms. Williamson said. ''People are terrified of losing their savings.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">South Americans, she said, have a different standard for economic instability. ''You have to understand that for buyers coming from South America, this is not a volatile market,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although international buyers today may come from far-flung corners, they often arrive with a deep knowledge of Manhattan -- even, for instance, seeking an apartment on a certain street or near a favored restaurant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As a foreigner,'' Mr. Gorozpe said, ''you want to be at the heart of it all. For me, there is no better place to be.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: October 17, 2010, Sunday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an article last Sunday about foreign buyers investing in New York real estate misstated the name of the firm that designed the Centurion in Midtown Manhattan, where a businessman from Mexico City bought a one-bedroom apartment. It is Pei Partnership Architects, not Pei Partnership Associates with I. M. Pei.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OCALA, Fla. -- Amanda Ducksworth was supposed to move in to her new home this week, a three-bedroom steal here in central Florida with a horse farm across the road. Instead, she is camped out with her 7-year-old son at her boss's house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like many buyers across the country, Ms. Ducksworth was about to complete the purchase of a foreclosed house when it suddenly went off the market. <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, the giant mortgage holding company that buys loans from commercial lenders, is pulling back sales of homes that might have been foreclosed in bad faith.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I gave up my rental thinking I would have a house,'' said Ms. Ducksworth, a 28-year-old catering assistant. ''Now I'm sharing a room with my son. What the hell is up with that?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With home sales this past summer at the lowest level in more than a decade, real estate is ill-prepared to suffer another blow. But as a scandal unfolds over mortgage lenders' shoddy preparation of foreclosure documents, the fallout is beginning to hammer the housing market, especially in states like Florida where distressed properties are abundant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This crisis takes a situation that's already bad and kind of cements it into place,'' said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist for MFR Inc., an economic consulting firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three major mortgage lenders -- <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>, GMAC Mortgage and <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span> -- have said they are suspending foreclosures in the 23 states where they first need a judge's approval. They are also waving off <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> from selling any of the foreclosed homes whose loans they sold to Fannie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The companies say they are reviewing their operations after disclosures that employees signed documents without determining the accuracy of the material, as is required by law.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those reviews are throwing into limbo hundreds of thousands of foreclosures and pending home sales, analysts estimate, though the lenders and <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> have been mostly silent about precise numbers and other specifics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More broadly, the revelations about the sloppy paperwork are emboldening homeowners and law enforcement officials in many states to question whether lenders rightfully hold the notes underlying foreclosed properties -- further chilling the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Distressed properties, many of which are in foreclosure, make up about a third of all home sales. ''Foreclosures are going to slow to a crawl,'' said Guy D. Cecala, publisher of the trade magazine Inside Mortgage Finance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the 23 states where foreclosures need court approval, Florida has by far the most trouble -- about a half-million cases clog its courts -- and the moratoriums are having a noticeable effect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because most lenders sold their mortgages to <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, it is largely that company that has been sending e-mails to real estate agents about putting off deals and removing houses from the market. In most cases, the agents are being told the freeze will last 30 to 90 days, but agents say there is no way to know for sure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A snapshot of the problems can be seen at the real estate agency that sold Ms. Ducksworth her home, Marc Joseph Realty, based in Fort Myers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agency had 35 deals that were supposed to close this month. As of Thursday, Fannie had postponed 11 of them. Another handful of homes that did not have offers or were being prepared for market had also been withdrawn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If this wipes out half my inventory, that's a scary thing,'' said Bill Mitchell, the agency's closing coordinator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As he spoke, his computer pinged and another message from Fannie came through about withdrawing a house. It had the subject line, ''Unable to Market Notice.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another client of the agency, Richard Clark, is caught in the foreclosure vise on both ends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A delivery truck driver, Mr. Clark has gone through several rough years: his wife lost her banking job and they eventually separated; a vending business did not succeed; he fell behind on his home payments; and <span class="companylink">CitiMortgage</span> rebuffed his efforts to restructure the mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the prospect of being tossed out of his house in a foreclosure of his own, Mr. Clark, 62, cobbled together $58,000 -- most of it from his parents -- and successfully bid on a house in North Fort Myers that was in foreclosure. His offer on the house, with three bedrooms and two baths, a Jacuzzi tub in the master bedroom and a Key lime tree in the backyard, was finally approved on Oct. 1.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's been a rocky two years,'' Mr. Clark, a stocky man with a short pony tail, wire-rim glasses and a gold hoop earring, said while touring the rambling one-story home. ''It's a dream house for me.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least, it was. On Tuesday, Fannie suspended the deal. Mr. Clark said he did not know what to do. ''I'm kind of hoping I have a place to live,'' he said. ''Now, who knows?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is possible the foreclosure on his current house in nearby Cape Coral -- he has a court hearing on Dec. 7 -- will also become caught up in the current problems, but Mr. Clark said he was not pleased by the prospect of staying there any longer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'd rather just get on with it, get on with my life,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the states far from Florida where foreclosures are an equally large problem but there is no judicial review -- Nevada, Arizona and California -- there were early signs this week that the document crisis was spreading. The only time a foreclosure in those states enters a courtroom is when the borrower sues the lender, something few of those in default have the money or the will to do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a telephone interview on Wednesday, Gary Kent, a foreclosure specialist in San Diego who has 80 listings, said he had not heard from Fannie or any lender about withdrawing a property. All his deals were on track, Mr. Kent said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a few hours later, Mr. Kent said he had received an e-mail about removing a home that was under contract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The message was from his title insurer, who said that Pittsburgh-based <span class="companylink">PNC Bank</span> was imposing a 30-day moratorium on all foreclosure sales. (PNC declined to comment to a reporter.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kent's confidence was shaken. ''My buyer's upset, my agent's upset and I'm a little nervous,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several factors are likely to delay many more foreclosed houses from reaching the market and finding new owners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Law enforcement officials in several states, including Texas, Maryland and Connecticut, are demanding a suspension of foreclosures until lenders can prove they are using legal methods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is unclear how many lenders will go along.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a move that sets up a potential showdown in Texas, one major lender, <span class="companylink">CitiMortgage</span>, is arguing that it is being considered guilty until proven innocent by the state attorney general.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have no reason to believe our employees are not following our process, and therefore have no reason to stop foreclosures,'' a Citi spokesman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another factor is the reaction of the title insurers, who defend homeowners in disputes over a home's ownership. Lenders require title insurance before approving a mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crisis took many title insurers by surprise, said Kurt Pfotenhauer, the chief executive of the industry's trade group, the American Land Title Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One possibility the title insurers are discussing is obtaining warranties from lenders against errors in their foreclosures. Every title insurer, Mr. Pfotenhauer said, ''understands there is a brand new risk that has to be evaluated. It's not at all clear that courts across the country are going to be reversing their earlier decisions on foreclosures. But we don't know.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, buyers like Ms. Ducksworth here in Ocala are at a loss for answers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''She's in a mess, actually,'' said Jim Haston, Ms. Ducksworth's agent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I really don't know what to tell her,'' he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Faced with the prospect that New Jersey's buildable open space could be gone by midcentury, developers are turning to projects that tap into existing infrastructure, use vacant buildings and emphasize the vertical over the horizontal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report released in July by Rowan and Rutgers Universities found that, after comparing aerial photos of the state, the years from 1986 to 2007 were New Jersey's most sprawling period, when unprotected land was developed most rapidly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When development ground to a halt in mid-2007 as the housing market collapsed, New Jersey had more acres of subdivisions and shopping malls than it had of upland forests and was down to its last million acres of developable land, according to the report, called ''Changing Landscapes in the Garden State.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two-thirds of the land developed in New Jersey from 2002 to 2007 became ''low-density, large-lot'' residential properties, swallowing farmland, wetlands and unprotected forest, the report found. Preservationists and some developers say that the building of large single-family homes on oversize lots cannot continue at that rate, even if the housing market recovers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You have to build not simply for the market we've experienced in the past, but for where the country is headed. Energy prices could soar. The price of the little remaining open space is unattainable,'' Robert G. Torricelli, a former senator who now has a development company, said in a telephone interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What will trigger denser development is that there's no space left, and what is left no one can build on,'' said David Henderson, a principal at HHG Development Associates, a Trenton company that focuses on sustainable building practices. According to the Rowan and Rutgers report, New Jersey is poised to become the first state to develop every acre of unprotected land, a milestone researchers predict will happen ''sometime within the middle of the century.'' But whatever the imperative, a number of untraditional projects seem to be finding acceptance with home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2006, Mr. Henderson and his partners bought some dilapidated 19th-century buildings in the Trenton Ferry Historic District in Trenton, including row houses and a former oyster cracker factory. They bought the properties for just under $470,000 and then spent $6.94 million, partly financed with a $2.27 million state subsidy, to restore the buildings using recycled materials and energy-efficient products.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The resulting residential development, called Trenton Ferry, went on the market in 2008 with 30 units, a combination of single-family homes, small condominium buildings and loft apartments. Prices ranged from under $49,000 for one of the affordable housing units to $325,000 for a four-bedroom town house. All but one unit has sold. The neighborhood, which is just a few blocks from the Mill Hill district of restored row houses, still lacks some amenities, but it is close to the train lines and within walking distance of shops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signs of a neighborhood rebirth are beginning to emerge: one of the new town house owners planted flowers in his sidewalk box, inspiring another new resident to join him. Now the block is lined with marigolds. The second phase of the Trenton Ferry project -- a renovation of several other abandoned properties and a new structure on an empty lot -- is awaiting city approval.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2005, Mr. Torricelli's development company, Woodrose Properties, paid the City of Trenton $1 for the Golden Swan, a row of early 19th-century buildings in the bustling State House district. After a $3.76 million restoration project that included $204,000 in city grants, there are now three loft rental apartments, offices and ground-floor retail space. Woodrose also bought an empty lot across the street and, with the Communication Workers of America and $100,000 in city grants, built the union a $3.48 million headquarters with space for retail businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One answer to sprawl is to build up rather than out. In 2004, <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> and Pinnacle paid $76 million for a 24-acre former Maxwell House coffee factory on the Hoboken waterfront and razed the 11 original buildings. In their place rose two 12-story luxury condos with ground-floor retail shops and a new street grid that connected the public to the waterfront, which includes a park and a waterfront walkway.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About a block from the ferry dock and two blocks from Hoboken shopping, the development, Maxwell Place, has sweeping views of the Hudson River and Manhattan; interiors designed by Michael Graves; and amenities like a child's playroom, a rooftop pool, a yoga studio and ample garden space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second building, which started selling in mid-2005, is about 75 percent sold, and of the 10 town houses, which start at $1.9 million, four remain on the market. <span class="companylink">Toll Brothers</span> has no immediate plans to build the second half of the project -- two parcels that don't offer the same unobstructed waterfront views.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With prices for Maxwell condos starting at around $550,000, buyers are paying a premium when they could spend the same money on a house with a yard elsewhere in New Jersey. But even as the last 20 years of sprawl show the appeal of large-lot homes in New Jersey, other trends suggest a growing hunger for the conveniences of developments like Maxwell Place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential building permits in urban and suburban town centers in 15 regions across the country more than doubled from 1990 to 2008, particularly in the New York metropolitan area, where redevelopment in urban areas made up half of all new residential construction, according to a study, ''Residential Construction Trends in America's Metropolitan Regions,'' released by the Environmental Protection Agency in January. The increases were particularly sharp in the last five years, with the trend continuing even in 2008, as the residential housing market weakened.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't see that McMansions are going to be the way of the future,'' said Jacqueline Urgo, president of the Marketing Directors, a marketing and residential sales agency. ''Opulence is out. It's smart living that people are looking for.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Robbinsville, a suburb of Trenton in Mercer County, for example, buyers flocked to Washington Town Center, a 400-acre development that first broke ground on sweeping cornfields in 2000. But rather than parcel out large, open lots, the development was focused on an entirely new downtown with modest single-family homes, town houses, loft condos, and central shopping built from the ground up. A decade after the project started, the developer, the Sharbell Development Corporation, is building out the remaining loft condos, many of which have already been sold, and has plans to build a final block of 39 condos for senior citizens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That thing sold out like it was going out of style because no one had built anything like it in decades,'' said B. Timothy Evans, research director at New Jersey Future, a public planning group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2007, <span class="companylink">New Jersey Transit</span> gave Roseland Property Company three acres near the Morristown train station in exchange for the developer's building a new parking lot along with a luxury rental apartment building. As part of the deal, the transit agency reserved ownership of 415 of the 722 parking spaces. The project, the Highlands at Morristown Station, a 217-unit rental building marketed to young professionals, opened last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Roseland has been investing heavily in the downtown Morristown market. This spring, it opened the Metropolitan, a luxury rental apartment building in the city. And in 2007 and 2008, the company opened two condo projects, Vail Mansion and 40 Park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sharbell recently built similar versions of the Washington Town Center model in Eastampton Township in Burlington County and in Plainsboro Township in Middlesex County.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is the way things are heading. It's all about affordability and sustainability today,'' said Thomas Troy, a principal of Sharbell. ''A lot of the shine around the McMansion is gone.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It wasn't just the swinging chair, strung from the ceiling, that was distracting. When apartment hunters stepped into the third-floor studio for sale at 650 Avenue of the Americas, they found a white leather circular bed with red pillows and a hanging L.E.D. lamp with colors shifting from green to blue. Some said it reminded them of the film ''2001: A Space Odyssey.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They would laugh,'' said one of the listing brokers for the building, John Gomes. This was the model apartment for a condominium conversion project, and it was not selling itself, much less helping to sell other apartments in the same building as it was intended to do. Mr. Gomes, of CORE Marketing Group, who took over listings in this Flatiron district building in April, stopped showing the model after roughly six viewings. ''I quickly realized that it hurt more than it helped.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gomes knew it would take more than replacing towels to make buyers feel comfortable in a space where even Lady Gaga might crave beige walls and cream couches. With help from a decorator, he had the white wood floors stained a darker shade and installed furniture more commonly found in Manhattan apartments, like a rectangular bed. He strategically placed on the kitchen counter martini glasses, a bowl of lemons and a shaker primed for after-work cocktails and left around reading material like the <span class="companylink">Sotheby's</span> catalog.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is the way I would live, and a lot of people can identify with this,'' said Mr. Gomes as he walked through the new model unit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His efforts have paid off. Mr. Gomes said that he had sold 20 apartments in the 67-unit building and had three contracts signed last week for apartments similar to the $925,000 model.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He says that the changes mean ''people can see it now.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the real estate boom, eager buyers bought apartments requiring enormous imagination to picture as homes: They bought unbuilt apartments or empty spaces with blank walls. When brokers put any furniture in model apartments, it was often abstract pieces like swinging chairs or orange couches.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, buyers are much less likely to take risks on apartments where they cannot figure out how to fit in their sofa bed or sideboard. So brokers have been redecorating old model units or filling unfurnished apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The difference between three years ago and now is that you could have actually shown an empty apartment without much staging,'' said Shaun Osher, chief executive of CORE. His firm now stages apartments that ''leave as little up to the imagination as possible.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For some high-end listings, Mr. Osher orders brokers to fill cabinets with fine china, not just ''dishes in there from Kmart.'' He has even had brokers fill closets of for-sale apartments with clothing like ''Louis Vuitton, Prada, Chanel, Paul Smith.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you're going to hang anything in the closet, it should be a name brand that the buyer can relate to,'' Mr. Osher said. The clothing and accessories do not go to waste: they get moved to the next condo project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 2007, brokers had been trying to sell a seventh-floor two-bedroom apartment at One Brooklyn Bridge Park. Rachel Poggi, the building's director of sales, had it professionally decorated and reintroduced after Labor Day for $1.275 million. When she opened the door to the apartment, it smelled and looked like an inhabited home. The coat rack at the front entrance had a woman's polka-dotted raincoat. A bedroom was fashioned into a girl's room, painted pink, featuring a bed with a hastily tossed baby doll and a dresser lined with glittery sunglasses and a pink purse. Another model unit had a room made up for a boy. Ms. Poggi said that since she had the apartment staged, two buyers, including a couple wanting to start a family, made offers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's been pretty consistent that when we furnish an apartment that we get multiple offers within days,'' Ms. Poggi said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the developers of 189 Schermerhorn put their apartments up for sale in 2009, they filled units with bright orange chairs and made it what Aaron Lemma, a Corcoran broker selling units there, called ''dormlike.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late last year, the project was taken over by one of its investors, Jamestown Properties, and the developer handed back deposits on the sold units and started from scratch. When the apartments came back up for sale in May, the apartments were fully decorated in subdued designs. One 16th-floor two-bedroom apartment was decorated in pale shades of blues and browns and was decorated with clean-lined furniture like the Goodwin sofa from West Elm and a table set with flatware from Crate and Barrel. Another one-bedroom unit featured dark-wood built-in cabinets that buyers could buy at a discount for their unit to get a better sense of how they would create more storage space. Mr. Lemma said that 137 out of 246 units have gone to contract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some buyers are following the building's decorating style. Liz Day is closing on Thursday on a one-bedroom apartment. She liked how the model apartment was staged so much that she thought about buying its couch, but she needed a sofa bed. She plans to paint her bedroom the same mocha color of the model. She credited the decorations with helping her to think ''about paint colors early and where art would hang.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When they decorate them in a style that sort of feels like your style, you're much more likely to make it feel like home,'' she said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PERHAPS more than any place on earth, New York is a city of real estate fantasists. Imaginations soar with visions of an extra bedroom or even an extra closet, a terrace with a view, a kitchen large enough to entertain in, or the magnificent ways one might fix up that town house down the street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past couple of years, as the real estate market and the economy both sank, the abiding fantasy of some New Yorkers has been that the market will slip low enough to afford them a weekend house in the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A little shingled retreat near a lake. Or a chalet with tall windows and views of mountains. An herb garden. Adirondack chairs and a sloping lawn. A place to grill! Perhaps a swimming pool with a stone patio shaded by a grove of trees ...</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back to reality. Prices have fallen significantly, but given the lingering uncertainty in the economy, is now a smart time to buy a second home?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A look at some of the second-home markets near New York suggests that it might be a very promising moment. From Columbia County to the Jersey Shore, many properties are selling for significantly below their asking prices (which were already a good 20 percent lower than during the market's peak) and sellers are accepting low offers -- in some cases, very low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgages on second homes have always been more difficult to get than for primary residences, and lenders today are more stringent than ever. But for buyers who qualify, rates are so low that financing a second-home purchase may never be cheaper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big question, of course, is this: Will property values fall further, making a purchase now premature, or are prices -- and interest rates -- about to start turning up?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers report that closings and showings are picking up -- two signs of market health. ''People have started to pull the trigger and make offers,'' said Bill Sidoriak, the principal broker at Fleming Realty, which covers Ulster County, N.Y., and towns like Woodstock and Saugerties. Many buyers, he said, have never before owned a second home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the New York State Association of Realtors, the number of resales of single-family homes (which includes primary residences as well as second homes) in Columbia County was up 36.3 percent the first half of this year compared with the first half of 2009, and prices edged up 4.1 percent during that period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Ulster County, the total number of sales grew 43.2 percent and prices grew 6.6 percent. In Suffolk County, on Long Island, which includes the Hamptons and the less pricey North Fork, the number of sales jumped 46.5 percent, but prices were down 0.8 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It seems like all of a sudden, in the last month and a half, people have been coming out of the woodwork and calling,'' said Mary Beaton Stapleton, an associate broker at Halstead Property in the Hudson Valley. But, like some other brokers, she believes that properties continue to be overvalued. ''I think the market still has a little bit of room to drop here,'' she said, ''whereas in New York City, I think it has bottomed out and now is starting to go up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A case in point: At Copake Lake in Columbia County, a new four-bedroom two-bath house with 4,421 square feet of space, cathedral ceilings, two stone fireplaces and a deck on three acres went on the market in April at $1.175 million. One month later, the seller dropped the asking price to $988,000. Just two weeks ago, he slashed it to $828,000. Ms. Stapleton said she advised him that the most recent reduction should have been to $795,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Rifton, a hamlet in Ulster County, an 1825 two-bedroom farmhouse with five fireplaces on seven acres is listed at $299,000. The property, which has a detached studio, would easily have sold for $450,000 during the boom, Mr. Sidoriak said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Litchfield County, Conn., a former fishing cottage on Silver Lake in the town of Sharon languished on the market for four years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The asking price in 2007 was $560,000. By this June it had dropped to $375,000. But there was little interest. A buyer from New York came along at the end of the summer and made an offer of $300,000. No dice. She then came up to $312,000. The seller took the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daniel Chen and Todd Kelly found they could negotiate on matters other than price. Mr. Chen, a graphic designer, and Mr. Kelly, an artist, who rent an apartment in Brooklyn, closed a couple of weeks ago on an 1890s farmhouse in Accord, an Ulster County hamlet less than two and a half hours from the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property, which had been part of a farm, was listed at $389,000 when they saw it. Instead of haggling on price, the couple persuaded the seller to increase the package by five more acres, encompassing a pond and raising the total acreage to 19.27 from about 14. In return Mr. Chen and Mr. Kelly paid a slightly higher price, $399,000. But it was still comfortably below the limit they had set for themselves, $450,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The farmhouse has four bedrooms and a bathroom and a half. But what the couple really love are the seven outbuildings, including a chicken coop, two barns and a corn crib that Mr. Kelly plans to convert into a painting studio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've always wanted a place in the country,'' said Mr. Chen, who grew up in an apartment in Queens. He had saved up enough money to consider buying a condo in Brooklyn, but prices there still seemed prohibitive, well over $500,000 for a one-bedroom, so he set his sights on a weekend place instead. ''The market obviously had a lot to do with it,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers in markets considered less fashionable than, say, the Hamptons or Litchfield County report that they have noticed an increase in interest among people who a few years ago might have aspired to a more glamorous locale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think during the boom years people were thinking big -- more land, a place near the shore,'' said Robert Morini, the brokerage manager of the Houlihan Lawrence offices in Brewster and Millbrook, N.Y. ''Now people are scaling down, saying I just want someplace to run to.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, he said, his firm has experienced a notable pickup in business among weekend buyers in places like Putnam County, N.Y., which includes the town of Cold Spring and the village of Kent and is about an hour and a half north of Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are back to doing weekend business, which is great,'' Mr. Morini said. ''We are not talking million-dollar-plus homes here. We're talking $300,000 to $600,000, or $700,000.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One property, he noted, a three-bedroom house on three acres of pastureland in Southern Dutchess County, was listed at $749,000 two years ago and has been ''chasing the market down.'' The price today: $419,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's an incredible deal for someone,'' said Mr. Morini, who has clients considering making an offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the North Fork of Long Island, sales have been picking up, though prices are still down, said Kathleen Rosenbaum, the principal broker at Lloyd's Realty in Greenpoint. ''I think waterfronts are great values now,'' she said. ''At one time you couldn't touch one for under $1 million. Now there are some for under a mil.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She cited a new listing in Greenport: a three-bedroom two-bath house with 1,300 square feet of space and a one-car garage on a half-acre lot with about 100 feet of ''deep water,'' meaning you could dock a boat as large as 50 feet. The sellers are asking $849,000. The house, the dock and the bulkhead need extensive renovations, Ms. Rosenbaum said, but the price would have been unheard of a few years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the Jersey Shore, Paul Vail, who recently opened his own real estate firm after 10 years of working for others, says opportunities for buyers abound.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Too much inventory has been sitting around for way too long,'' he said. ''It's pretty glutted. But for buyers it's the perfect storm.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, he said, there are bargains to be had in Asbury Park, an oceanfront community that is marketing itself as more affordable than the Hamptons or Fire Island. Recently he closed a deal there on a 100-year-old home for $569,000. It sold at the asking price after only 41 days on the market, he said, because it was fully renovated. ''That's what moves these days. There is so much on the market, the second-home buyer absolutely wants something they're not going to have to put money into.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">North Beach Asbury Park, a luxury condo complex on the ocean, was conceived and built during the boom years. But by the time it opened, the market was starting to fade, so the developers decided to turn the unsold apartments into rental units. Now, Mr. Vail said, they are putting some back on the market; two-bedroom units with ocean views in a complex that includes a pool and other amenities are listed at $429,000 to $499,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, country real estate has microclimates, and just as Asbury Park is not Amagansett, one part of Connecticut may vary from another. Carolyn Klemm, the founder of Klemm Real Estate in Litchfield County, specializes in properties of $500,000 to $10 million. She thinks bargains may already be history. ''There are people out there who don't realize they've missed the bottom of the market,'' said Ms. Klemm, adding that she closed deals on ''$15 million worth of houses'' one week last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She recounted a showing recently of a beautiful ''quintessential Connecticut home'' on 12 acres with a long driveway, a swimming pool and views. It was on the market for $2.75 million. Her clients declared that the sellers would never get more than $2.3 million. Almost immediately after they left, somebody bid just under $2.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other day, Ms. Klemm said, the owner accepted an offer; she would not disclose what it was.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Robin Leech, the owner of Robinson Leech Real Estate in Lakeville in northern Litchfield County, says properties are not selling all that fast. In his opinion Litchfield County asking prices are still high -- in some cases as much as 30 percent above market value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sellers, feeling the worst is over, are asking more than they can reasonably expect to get, he said. And buyers go in assuming they can chop 10 or 20 percent off the asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Little by little,'' he said, ''the cream of each category -- lakefront, village houses, country farms -- is being picked off slowly, but there is not a steady surge of activity.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most brokers agree it's all about pricing. ''Things can take two weeks to sell if they're priced right, or can take a very long time,'' said Nancy Horowitz-Felcetto, a broker and manager of Halstead's Hudson Valley office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Germantown, she said, a four-bedroom Arts and Crafts-style house on 22 acres with old stone walls, a stream and a big weeping willow did nothing for seven months at $695,000. About two months ago the asking price dropped to $595,000. Immediately, Ms. Horowitz-Felcetto had four showings and a reshowing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several parties have expressed interest, but there are no offers yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: October 10, 2010, Sunday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The cover article last Sunday, about the market for second homes around the region, misidentified the town on the North Fork of Long Island where a three-bedroom house with a dock and bulkhead is for sale. It is Greenport, not Greenpoint.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RIDGEFIELD</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHATEVER the number of transactions in the luxury real estate market these days, they seem especially scarce among gracious period pieces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Take the house for sale at 885 Edgewater Avenue in Ridgefield, built in 1935 by the president of <span class="companylink">American Express</span>, one of few institutions to remain profitable in the Depression. The house has floor-to-ceiling tiger-oak paneling on the first floor, five bedrooms, four baths, three half baths, a turret, and a bowling alley inside a tunnel that connects to a three-car garage. Everything is stunningly well preserved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Like a time capsule,'' said its listing agent, Barbara Liati of Prominent Properties Sotheby's International, without exaggeration. There is the amazing octagonal master bath, hand-tiled on floor, walls and ceiling; the kitchen has pristine original appliances: a six-burner Glenwood stove and a Kelvinator refrigerator -- even a vintage electric range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We were bowled over with the way it presented an Old World luxury that seemed untouched,'' said Preston Zucker, a retired pediatrician, who with his wife, Christine, bought the house four years ago for $1.7 million and now has it listed for $1.5 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In real estate, the world has sorely changed in four years, never mind since 1935.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another example of seemingly anachronistic luxury, also built that year, is the seven-bedroom Tudor at 100 Gregory Avenue in West Orange that was originally the home of Edgar Bamberger, a member of the family that founded Bamberger's department stores (eventually subsumed by <span class="companylink">Macy's</span>). The house has two dressing rooms off the master bedroom, three fireplaces, a library, three new baths (out of seven), and a new swimming pool.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is set on 1.79 acres, which would make the property ''an excellent value'' on its own, according to the listing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Bamberger estate, as it is called, was listed for $1.249 million in May, and then after very few showings reduced to $1.099 million in June. In July the price was reduced again, to $899,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've come so low, I have to believe there will be someone from New York who will want to buy magnificence for a song,'' said Alice Nagy, who is offering the house for sale on behalf of her 91-year-old mother. The Zucker house, similarly, has been sitting since April; there was one offer, Mr. Zucker said, but it was too low. In the current recessionary era, real estate specialists say, homes with landmark status are far more likely to languish on the market than to sweep buyers off their feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Older, historic houses are taking a back seat to newer, more cookie-cutter houses right now,'' said Karen Eastman Bigos, a broker with Towne Realty Group in Short Hills, a place with a large stock of distinctive older houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Luxury-level'' buyers today want new plumbing, new electric wiring, new windows -- not stained glass, or even the rippled glass prized by preservationists, Ms. Bigos said. ''We've seen a dramatic fall-off in buyers who want old-style elegant,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She linked this in part to an increase in the number of foreign-born shoppers buying at the higher levels, citing data provided by the Otteau Valuation Group, which found that nearly 40 percent of those buying for $1.2 million and above in New Jersey last year were foreign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to differences in personal preference, she added, there are cultural differences among buyers. For example, ''many people from Asia and India must have a bedroom on the first floor for when their parents visit, which older homes do not have. Because of their culture, it cannot be less impressive than the master bedroom -- not some squalid little maid's room in the basement -- because that would be disrespectful.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house on Edgewater Avenue in Ridgefield has a huge family room in the basement with a fireplace and a built-in bar with automatic cup washer. It has two apartments over the big garage. But it does not have a first-floor bedroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Zuckers, who now reside mostly in Santa Fe, N.M., bought the house as a second home in a whirlwind purchase, having fallen in love with it when they dropped by to consider buying the stove for Mrs. Zucker's cake-baking business. ''We'll take the stove, along with the house,'' Mr. Zucker remembers saying to Ms. Liati in a call made on the way home from the showing. (Ms. Liati was the broker for the property at that time, too.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But you don't need another house,'' Ms. Liati responded. His reply: ''Need is not what we're talking about.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Nagy's parents bought the West Orange house in 1971, after her father had made a killing in the mail-order business, she said; they bought it from Meredith Gourdine, a well-known inventor and Olympic silver medalist in long jump in 1952 at Helsinki, Finland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Oh, we had a great time living it up in that incredible house,'' Ms. Nagy said. ''Today, it seems like it's not really popular to be rich, but the right buyer for this one has to be out there somewhere.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Liati also spoke of trolling for ''that special buyer,'' and of believing it will happen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Houses like this,'' she said, standing in the cavernous living room of the Ridgefield property, with its beamed ceilings and fieldstone fireplace, ''their moment cannot have passed forever.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nicole Paris's daughter Julia is a well-spoken high school freshman who likes math and history, plays three sports and rehearses German and Italian arias. Her 9-year-old sister, Natalie, enjoys hip-hop dance classes, making crafts with markers and paints, and planning events like her birthday party.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This summer they picked up another skill: advising their mother on what apartment she should rent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They did not like a sprawling fifth-floor walk-up near East End Avenue in Manhattan. The issue was not so much the stairs as the separated kitchen and dining spaces, which would have made it hard for them to chat with their mother while she cooked. And the stove was so small that it could not accommodate standard-size cookie sheets, let alone a Thanksgiving turkey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The girls also dismissed a newly renovated apartment in the East 60s with designer kitchen appliances, because the combined living and dining spaces meant their older brothers would not have enough privacy when they visited on weekends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They're both pretty mature, and I get them involved as much as I can,'' Ms. Paris said of the girls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She added that it was especially important because ''if you're making a huge change like we did, the culture shock could be devastating.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The helicopter parent who plans and hovers over all of a child's activities has kin in the real estate world: children who find themselves helping their parents, involved in a process that even adults find daunting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frances Katzen, a broker with Prudential Douglas Elliman, recently had two girls, ages 11 and 12, appear without a parent at an open house for a $3.1 million apartment at 52 East 78th Street. The sisters signed in with their e-mail address (which referred to frogs), asked questions about layout and praised the bathroom before politely leaving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reyn Rossington, an agent with the real estate company Core, visited eight apartments with a European buyer and the man's 15-year-old son and 17-year-old daughter. The buyer was using the hunt as a teaching tool, having his teenagers take notes and calculate each building's monthly costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether including children in real estate decisions is nurturing or stressful is a question with no absolute answer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lisa Spiegel, co-director of the parent counseling center Soho Parenting, praises parents who use real estate to teach teenagers about the value of money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But she said that involving children who were too young could create needless anxieties for them, because they do not grasp the concept of moving.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Parents sometimes don't see the disservice they are doing to their families,'' Ms. Spiegel said. ''It doesn't take into consideration the mind of a child.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After deciding to separate, Ms. Paris and her husband wanted to have their two oldest children, both boys, remain on Long Island to finish high school. Ms. Paris would move to the city with the girls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because they were moving from a 10,000-square-foot home in Upper Brookville to one that would be far smaller, she thought that including her daughters in the search would help the transition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The girls quickly took to their advisory roles. ''The girls were so practical,'' said Amy Herman, the Halstead broker who represented them. ''They said: 'This doesn't have room for a dining table. Where are we going to do our homework?' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Paris was ''reading their faces'' at every listing and tried to keep the girls focused by taking breaks at cafes and having snacks like frozen yogurt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate also taught them lessons in compromises. Julia wanted a building with a swimming pool, until she learned that meant having a smaller bedroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After seeing at least 30 apartments, they finally settled on a two-bedroom in the East 70s. It ''fit the furniture perfectly,'' and the kitchen had ''all of the storage space,'' Julia said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They agreed they would share a bedroom and searched online for bunk beds, measuring to make sure they had enough room to walk around the bed to their desk. And the place has a nice-size living room, where, Natalie said, adults could ''socialize.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''At first I thought it was going to be boring,'' Julia said. ''Then I thought it was fun to fit everything in.''</p>

</div><div class="author">By DAVID M. HALBFINGER and MICHAEL BARBARO; David W. Chen, Javier C. Hernandez and Raymond Hernandez contributed reporting.   </div><div>3065 words</div><div>27 September 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When his troubled son spent a night in the Erie County lockup on drunken-driving charges, Carl P. Paladino parked outside the jail and slept in his car, just to be close to him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he ran out of patience with Buffalo's failing public schools, he bought time on local radio stations to demand the resignation of the superintendent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Hello-o-o-o,'' his booming voice declared in the ads. ''It's time for you to go-o-o-o.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And when an older man, the lone holdout blocking Mr. Paladino's development of a megastore, refused to sell the house he had lived in for 50 years, Mr. Paladino filed plans to surround the man's home with a sea of asphalt, which officials rejected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Paladino, 64, a rumpled, weary-eyed developer from western New York, seemed to emerge from nowhere to capture the Republican nomination for governor, a political unknown who became a vessel for Tea Party-tinged anger against insiders and incumbents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for decades he has been an outsize, impulsive and often outrageous figure: polarizing in his politics, relentless in amassing his real estate empire and irrepressible in seeking to impose his will on civic life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interviews with dozens of people who know him -- friends, relatives, admirers and adversaries -- revealed a highly emotional man who oscillates between cursing his enemies and crying over his friends' sorrows, who believes in elbows-out confrontation no matter the cost and whose lifelong dealings with the government have fueled his enormous wealth and his bottomless rage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By crusading for a series of quixotic causes against the local establishment, Mr. Paladino has frequently been dismissed as little more than a deep-pocketed gadfly. But his rash style and undeniable passion have at times proved to be his biggest assets, and are now propelling him toward a goal that once seemed unthinkable: upsetting Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo to become governor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Father's Teachings</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Paladino's father, Belesario, who immigrated to this country from Italy at age 6, raised three children on Buffalo's East Side and became a city water inspector. For the older man, the home was an oasis amid a taxing blue-collar life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outside, he felt the sting of anti-Italian discrimination, and he changed his name to Bill. Inside, he spoke in aphorisms about hard work, declaring there was ''no such word as 'can't.' '' And he warned against trusting the slick messages coming out of faraway places like New York City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Paladino children, Carl, Joe and Mary Lou, lived in the same two-family house that their father grew up in; their uncle lived in the apartment upstairs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carl, the oldest, revered his father, whose second job, selling and repairing medical equipment, paid for the son's parochial school education -- a luxury in their neighborhood -- and for his college tuition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The thought of his father's humility still chokes up Mr. Paladino. ''On his deathbed, in full hearing of the family,'' he said, his words interrupted by long pauses, ''he looked at me, and he says, 'I'm sorry I can't leave you anything.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His father sent him to St. Bonaventure University, a small Roman Catholic institution 90 minutes south of Buffalo that seemed insulated from the upheaval of the 1960s. Even among his crowd, Mr. Paladino was an admitted square, organizing weekend social events, playing chess into the wee hours and performing drills with his R.O.T.C. unit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We really didn't get with that hippie program,'' he said in an interview. ''We had our heads shaved close, and we had a war going on.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He met his future wife, Mary Catherine Hannon, at one of the events he planned, though their first meeting did not go well. He made a joke about her uncle back in Buffalo, whose indictment was all over the newspapers, and she threw a beer at him. ''It wasn't nice,'' he said of his remark, calling it an early, if unheeded, lesson about keeping ''my big mouth shut.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After graduating in 1968, he received a deferment to attend Syracuse University College of Law. He drove home each weekend, a 300-mile round trip, to work on a newspaper printing press to help pay for his classes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three years later, he traveled with his pregnant wife to Fort Bliss, an Army post in Texas, where he was soon given command of 200 soldiers training for combat in Vietnam, where he expected to be sent. But that September, the orders changed. The American presence in Vietnam was being reduced, and Mr. Paladino's unit would not be deployed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A day after he learned that, his wife gave birth to a boy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Turning Point</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back in Buffalo in late 1971, Mr. Paladino, then 25, began trying to untangle the messy business affairs of his wife's father, Dan Hannon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hannon, a real estate agent, a father of 10 and an organizer of South Buffalo's St. Patrick's Day Parade, had run afoul of the Internal Revenue Service, which imposed heavy assessments and garnished his earnings for several years, Mr. Paladino said. The pressure consumed Mr. Hannon, and he died of a stroke in 1970, at age 51.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Paladino spent three months examining records before concluding that his father-in-law had been the victim of bogus accusations and an overzealous I.R.S. agent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Steam was coming out of my ears,'' he said. ''There was nothing there. They'd killed him, and there were no grounds.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Paladino said he called the agent, laid out his findings and threatened to report him to prosecutors. ''There was dead silence, and I realized he was crying,'' Mr. Paladino said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the agent admitted to having overstepped in his pursuit of the case, agreed to remove the assessments hanging over Mr. Hannon's estate and to refund tens of thousands of dollars the agency had seized, and then resigned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The story could not be verified; Mr. Paladino declined to name the agent. But the lessons from that battle were seared into his memory, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I learned the need to properly prepare, and to know what you're talking about,'' Mr. Paladino said. ''And the necessity to confront when you're right.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hannon's death proved a major turning point in Mr. Paladino's career. He took over Mr. Hannon's management of the Ellicott Square building, a faded but much beloved grande dame of Buffalo real estate. In 1975, its owners defaulted on their mortgage, and the bank, a subsidiary of <span class="companylink">J. P. Morgan</span>, kept Mr. Paladino on as manager of the cavernous office building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He threw out tenants he deemed undesirable and leased the building to 96 percent occupancy, he said. In June 1978, a grateful Morgan executive helped Mr. Paladino put together a partnership to buy the building, and even lent Mr. Paladino the $62,500 for his share, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He had a $500 line of credit on his MasterCharge, two children, an old Mustang and, now, perhaps the most famous building in Buffalo, an Italian Renaissance-style gem that was one of the world's largest when it opened in 1896.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Paladino's responsibilities and long workdays took a toll. He said he began to suffer anxiety attacks that landed him in the emergency room every few months. Even so, he scarcely slowed down. He bought other downtown buildings at rock-bottom prices: a former bank headquarters, a shuttered department store.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also began building drugstores for <span class="companylink">Rite Aid</span>, eventually becoming the company's preferred developer across upstate New York and western Pennsylvania. The cookie-cutter buildings gave Mr. Paladino's company, Ellicott Development, a ready source of profits. He said he built 160 stores, 80 of which he still owns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it was as a downtown Buffalo landlord, eventually the city's largest, that Mr. Paladino developed his love-hate relationship with government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He lavished campaign contributions on city and county leaders, and reaped handsome benefits: appointments to the city parking board and a financial planning commission; and repeated extensions of development deadlines. When he fenced off a city street to use as a parking lot, officials looked the other way. When an out-of-town company was chosen to redevelop a defunct department store, Mr. Paladino somehow wrested the assignment away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And dozens of local, county, state and federal government agencies filled huge spaces in his office buildings, vastly enhancing the value of his portfolio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Being a landlord to government tenants also offered him a insider's look at waste and inefficiency. He met state employees with too little work to do and watched offices throw out unused supplies. When the Department of Transportation moved into one of his buildings, it insisted on replacing perfectly good furniture at taxpayers' expense, his brother said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Paladino puts the value of his real estate holdings at $500 million and his personal net worth at more than $150 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he has few of the toys that such wealth often allows. He never buys new cars, and though he owns a modest condominium in Boca Raton, Fla., he seldom goes there. His wife often uses the apartment, and Mr. Paladino lends it out to friends, relations, secretaries and other employees so frequently that neighbors call it ''the motel.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Paladino does spend his money on meals at some of Buffalo's better restaurants, though the staple in his diet is a dish with local pride: chicken wings (medium hot and crispy).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His extravagances can be as impulsive as his opinions. When he attended a summer wedding at his family's ancestral home in southern Italy and discovered there was no air-conditioning, he said he drove to every appliance shop for miles around, bought up their supply of fans, and handed them out to everyone he saw.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New Orleans on one of his yearly junkets to the Super Bowl, Mr. Paladino said, he and a friend found that each had an extra ticket. Mr. Paladino said he went to the sidewalk, found a 9-year-old boy with his mother soaking in the pregame excitement and handed them the tickets. His only condition was that they watch the game themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The kid was just thrilled,'' said the friend, David Rutecki. ''The mother was probably thinking she could sell them for $900 apiece and use the money, but that wasn't what Carl wanted. He wanted to give the kid an experience.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'The Style of a Bully'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Emboldened by his success in business, Mr. Paladino increasingly made his voice heard in politics. He set his sights on one of Buffalo's most powerful elected officials: James W. Pitts, the city council president, whom he accused of ruling by intimidation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pitts was the ranking black official in Buffalo, and Mr. Paladino's efforts were denounced as an attempt to erode emerging black political power. Undeterred, Mr. Paladino financed repeated charter-reform campaigns that sharply reduced the powers of the office that Mr. Pitts held.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Anybody that disagrees with him, he's going to try to run over,'' Mr. Pitts said. ''It's the style of a bully.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In their most memorable exchange, Mr. Pitts, lamenting the lengthening shadow that Mr. Paladino cast over the city, told him, ''You sit on top of the city of Buffalo like a vulture on dry bones.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At times, Mr. Paladino's rants have had a crazy quality: He once suggested that an aide to Mayor Byron W. Brown would ''soon be frolicking in a prison shower.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, even as he alienated some leaders, Mr. Paladino endeared himself to others. Larry Quinn, a former city development official, remembered receiving a scorching letter from Mr. Paladino, whose name he had not known. So he called him up and told Mr. Paladino he was misinformed. The two went out for beers and became fast friends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He's not a crank at all,'' said Mr. Quinn, now a managing partner of the Sabres hockey team. ''You can tell him off, and he's O.K. with it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a higher profile came greater scrutiny. The National Labor Relations Board ruled that Mr. Paladino broke the law by firing a shop steward, interrogating workers and refusing to negotiate a contract with the janitors' union.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2000, an Ellicott executive pleaded guilty to a felony, and the company was fined $500,000 over asbestos-removal work in Syracuse. ''Humbling,'' Mr. Paladino called it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was not humbled after a roof caved in at an old downtown hotel he was renovating, injuring a worker. When the worker sued, Mr. Paladino, in a deposition, repeatedly referred to the man as a ''moron,'' ignoring a lawyer's pleas to stop using such language.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a gruff man, he has sometimes been sensitive about his reputation. He sued a free newspaper for $30 million because, he said, ''they make it look like I go around knocking down historic buildings in Buffalo.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in 2003, he did just that. After promising to restore a well-known fixture of the city's old waterfront industry, the Harbor Inn, he abruptly razed it on a Saturday morning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When you give this guy an inch, he takes a mile,'' said Tim Tielman, a preservationist in the city. ''People weary of fighting, and Carl seems to have boundless energy for the fight, for conflict -- it kind of turns him on.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2005, he finally took up a cause that everyone in Buffalo could agree on. He sued the State Thruway Authority to remove a 75-cent toll on motorists entering the city -- a nuisance with enormous symbolic potency for a city down at its heels, and a burden on poorer commuters. When the toll booths were torn down in 2006, Mr. Paladino at last enjoyed applause from every direction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But 18 months later, complaining about city schools, he asserted that the superintendent had gotten his job only ''because he was black,'' drawing officials' censure and renewing cries that Mr. Paladino was, simply, racist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Family Tragedy</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As his public involvement intensified, he was harboring an agonizing secret in his private life: He had had an affair with a female employee, which resulted in a child named Sarah. He had begun to tell his children, but he could not bring himself to inform his wife. ''I adore her,'' Mr. Paladino said. ''I didn't want to bring that hurt.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His son Patrick, then 29 and struggling with an addiction to drugs and alcohol, proposed a deal: In exchange for his entering a substance-abuse program, his father would have to tell his wife, Cathy, about Sarah, then 9.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each man kept his end of the bargain, and Sarah, whom Mr. Paladino supports financially, has been fully incorporated into his family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in March 2009, a few weeks after leaving rehab, Patrick lost control of his sport utility vehicle on a darkened highway and crashed into a row of trees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was the only person in the room with him when he came to terms with the fact that his son would die,'' Mr. Paladino's brother, Joe, recalled. ''He was on his knees. He was crushed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The day of the accident, Mr. Paladino was scheduled to speak at what would have been his first Tea Party rally. He canceled his appearance, but did not stay away for long.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still grieving but hungry for a distraction, he became a regular at Tea Party events. Taking the microphone in jeans and a T-shirt, he railed against the state's sky-high taxes and bloated bureaucracy, electrifying crowds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was Carl being Carl,'' said Rus Thompson, a Buffalo contractor and Tea Party organizer who convinced Mr. Paladino a few weeks later that an outsider like him could have a shot at governor. ''He said exactly what they were thinking,'' Mr. Thompson added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mood of the electorate, furious and fevered, had at last caught up with Mr. Paladino's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: October 8, 2010, Friday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Sept. 27 about Carl P. Paladino and his hometown of Buffalo described a neighborhood in the city incorrectly in some editions. Though Mr. Paladino's father raised his children in a part of the East Side of Buffalo that was heavily Italian, the East Side as a whole was not largely Italian.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- New orders for long-lasting American manufactured goods fell more than expected in August to post their largest decline in a year as bookings for aircraft and motor vehicles tumbled, but business spending rebounded strongly, a government report showed on Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said durable goods orders dropped 1.3 percent after a revised 0.7 percent increase in July. Markets had expected orders to fall 1.0 percent from a previously reported 0.4 percent gain. The decline last month reflected a 40.2 percent plunge in nonmilitary aircraft orders after a 69.1 percent surge in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">The Boeing Company</span> received only 10 orders for civilian aircraft in August, a sharp slowdown from 130 bookings in July, according to information posted on the plane maker's Web site. Orders were also weighed down by bookings for military aircraft, which fell 2.7 percent, and a 4.4 percent drop in motor vehicle orders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Excluding transportation, orders rose by a more-than-expected 2 percent after falling by a revised 2.8 percent in July, previously reported as a 3.7 percent fall. It was the largest rise since March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Markets had expected a 1.0-percent rise in orders excluding transportation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Durable goods orders are a leading indicator of manufacturing, a sector leading the economy's recovery from the longest and deepest recession since the Great Depression as businesses replenish inventories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But manufacturing is slowing as domestic demand remains tepid, with households grappling with unemployment and falling wealth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonmilitary capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending, rebounded 4.1 percent in August after a 5.3 percent drop in July. Markets had expected a 2.0 percent rise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Durable goods inventories rose 0.4 percent after increasing 0.6 percent in July. Shipments, which go into the calculation of gross domestic product, declined 1.5 percent last month, while unfilled orders dropped for a second straight month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a second report, sales of new homes in the United States were flat in August, but the supply of houses on the market tumbled to the lowest level in 42 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department reported August sales at a 288,000 unit annual rate, unchanged from July's rate, which was revised up from a previously reported 276,000 unit pace. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales rising to a 290,000 unit pace in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market is starting to stabilize after a downward spiral after the end of a home-buyer tax credit in April. Data this week showed home construction rose last month and sales of previously owned homes crawled off 13-year lows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But activity in the sector, which contributed to the worst recession since the Great Depression, remains subdued amid a 9.6 percent unemployment rate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of new homes available for sale fell 1.4 percent to 206,000 units, the lowest since August 1968. Despite August's unchanged sales pace, the supply of new homes on the market dipped to 8.6 months' worth from 8.7 months' worth in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sale price for a new home fell 0.6 percent last month from July to $204,700, the lowest since December 2003. Compared with August last year, the median price fell 1.2 percent.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">U.S. Home Sales in August Matched Modest Forecasts</span>
</div><div class="author">By DAVID STREITFELD    </div><div>559 words</div><div>24 September 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.    </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales stabilized in August after a deep tumble in July, a development that, in the context of a severely troubled housing market, counts as good news.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes rose 7.6 percent last month from July's miserable levels but were still the second weakest since 1997, the National Association of Realtors said. Sales were down 19 percent from August 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results matched analysts' expectations, which were modest. ''It's not much to write home about,'' Michael D. Larson of Weiss Research said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a seasonally adjusted annualized basis, August sales were 4.13 million, up from 3.84 million in July. In a typical year before the boom, more than five million existing homes were sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few analysts anticipated the carnage in July, when sales fell 27 percent from June. A tax credit that propped up the market last winter but expired in the spring took most of the blame.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the lowest interest rates in 50 years, prompted by the government's large-scale buying of mortgage-backed securities, could not make much headway. The rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage slid as low as 4.32 percent this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between the low rates and the 30 percent decline in prices from the peak, monthly mortgage payments are about half what they were at the peak of the boom. Then no one wanted to wait to buy; now potential buyers have infinite patience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales over the next few months are likely to remain subdued. Weekly applications for new mortgages show little growth but little decline either.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is still some demand out there,'' Jennifer H. Lee of BMO Capital Markets said in a research note, ''just not a heck of a lot.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing is on its own these days. The government is unlikely to add to its panoply of foreclosure relief plans, and interest rates do not appear likely to fall further. A rebound will depend on a pickup in employment and the formation of new households, both of which keep receding into the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Slumping sales will undermine prices as sellers compete to find buyers. Some indexes are already starting to fall again. The <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> reported this week that its home price index dropped 0.5 percent on a seasonally adjusted basis in July from June. The index is down 3.3 percent over the last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics lowered its expectation for prices last week, saying they will drop 8 percent more. Previously, <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> forecast a 5 percent drop. It also postponed the date for the market bottom from the first quarter of 2011 to the third quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of homes on the market, whether from banks or households, will weigh heavily on prices. While inventories declined slightly in August, they are still at an elevated level.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It takes about a year to sell a house, the Realtors' group said. That is more than double the time in a healthy economy. If the number of foreclosures on the market continues to rise, inventories will swell considerably.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Europe's commercial real estate owners, saddled with 1.9 trillion euros ($2.5 trillion) of debt, may be forced to make billions of euros in cash payments under planned laws that would treat them like hedge funds, Bloomberg News reports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property fund managers could face demands for cash collateral to cover bets on interest-rate movements, under European Commission proposals to regulate the derivatives industry. Interest-rate swaps were attached to about 130 billion ($204 billion) of U.K. real estate debt at the end of 2009, according to a De Montfort University study. Most would be subject to such a payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is a perfectly genuine risk at this point that the commission will win the day and, not only real estate funds, but also European real estate investment trusts will be caught." said Peter Cosmetatos, finance director at the British Property Federation.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Housing starts in the United States increased more than expected in August, to their highest level in four months, and permits for residential construction also rose, government data showed on Tuesday, suggesting that the embattled market was starting to stabilize after the end of a tax credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said housing starts rose 10.5 percent, the largest increase since November, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 598,000 units. July's residential construction was revised down to show a 0.4 percent gain, which was previously reported as a 1.7 percent increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts polled by Reuters had expected housing starts to rise to a 550,000-unit rate. Compared with August a year ago, housing starts were up 2.2 percent.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Casey B. Mulligan is an economics professor at the University of Chicago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Home Buyer Tax Credit contained in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 has been given much credit for buoying the housing market. But recent housing market data suggest that the credit's effect was limited, even while it lasted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The law passed in February 2009 included a temporary 10 percent capped tax credit for qualified first-time home buyers that expired April 30, 2010. The program was later expanded to include repeat home buyers, and recently home buyers were given until September 2010 to complete qualified transactions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One view of the tax credit's effect is that it changes the timing of housing transactions -- market participants rush to complete transactions before the credit expires -- but has little effect on the value and quantity of homes because homes are expected to last many times longer than the tax credit does. Another view is that the market cannot do without the credit, and the housing market collapse that preceded it may well continue when it's gone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although we do not yet have housing data beyond the summer of 2010, homes take time to build and housing starts can be informative about what will happen in the housing market over the next few months. A housing start is likely to be a house that will be finished in a few months, and presumably builders expect to command a high enough sales price to cover the costs on building the house.The chart below shows seasonally adjusted single-family housing starts and completions since October 2008. Housing completions rose sharply as the deadline neared and spiked immediately after it, and for July and August were about as low as they have been in years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing starts began coming down this spring, which helped set up the situation of few completions in July and August. But yesterday's release by the Census Bureau confirmed that housing starts are not much lower than they were in the second half of 2009, when the tax credit was supposedly propping them up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, it appears that, aside from this spring's rush to meet the tax-credit deadline, the housing market after the tax credit will proceed at much the same pace it did for the time that the credit was in place.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE fall real estate season is under way, and the school of hard realities is in session.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The sales data is telling us nothing good,'' said the market analyst Jeffrey G. Otteau. ''Going into the end of the year, the trends are overwhelmingly negative in New Jersey: lagging home sales, declining prices, an inventory buildup -- and everything in place to indicate the foreclosure rate will continue to rise.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Otteau is the president of the Otteau Valuation Group, which collects contract sales data in 21 counties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The August report showed a severe three-month-long dip in sales pace over the previous year, occurring in what has traditionally been the strong spring-to-summer period. ''Now we are in the throes of fall,'' he said, ''when sales are always slower, and the general doldrums just grow more intense.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Otteau said he remained loyal to the real estate maxim that local market situations differed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But based on the ''truths inherent in the data,'' he predicted, no county, community or neighborhood in New Jersey would be unaffected by the overall market's downward slump heading into 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Sales will remain sluggish, and home prices will go through a second round of declines, across the board in the state,'' he said. ''What will vary by market is the degree, the magnitude and depth of the weakening.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the August report, Mr. Otteau described the May-June-July period after the expiration of the federal home-buyer tax-credit program as ''the weakest in six years -- making it clear that the housing market is unable to sustain itself without additional stimulus.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He had previously spoken hopefully about the potential impact of a legislative plan to set aside $100 million in state tax credits for home buyers. The plan was in any case vetoed by Gov. Christopher J. Christie in July, in the midst of a budgetary crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked for her view on fall market trends, Judy Appleby, the president of the New Jersey Association of Realtors, who is the broker/owner of Appleby Realty in the Ocean County community of Seaside Heights, said she liked to ''stay positive.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't have a crystal ball,'' Ms. Appleby said. ''I just know what the market has always been, and that the phone is ringing. We've had two new listings in the last two days. The signs go up, and the phones start ringing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, she noted, ''For anyone financially capable of buying a house, it is a good time to buy, because prices have already fallen, and interest rates are so low.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Otteau agreed on that point. ''There is the opportunity to make up ground on a trade-up purchase,'' he said. ''If the market in your area has fallen by the average 20 percent over the last five years, your $400,000 home has lost $80,000 in value. But the $600,000 home you might have your eye on has lost $120,000 in value. Assuming you still have equity in your home -- and can come up with a down payment -- it is the best of times to trade up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if home prices continue to decline as Mr. Otteau predicts, he said a buyer trading up would still reap the long-term benefit of a low-interest-rate mortgage (currently about 4.35 percent).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, he added, ''What is so troubling about the picture here in New Jersey is that housing trends tend to be a leading indicator of what will happen in the overall economy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because ''this recent relapse in the housing market follows 11 consecutive months of rising home sales,'' which had the effect of helping stimulate other economic activity and employment, Mr. Otteau predicted that ''going forward, if the housing market continues to lag, the reverse pattern can be expected.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Due to the close relationship between unemployment, home prices and mortgage delinquency,'' he said, ''foreclosure rates would rise further later this year.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Jersey is ranked 14th among the states in its rate of mortgage foreclosure, according to data published by RealtyTrac, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Noting that <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, the government housing finance agencies, recently ordered mortgage lenders to move faster on foreclosure actions, Mr. Otteau said greater speed would also probably contribute to price declines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In New Jersey,'' he said, ''the foreclosure process has been drawn out exceptionally long, often more than a year. The likely effect of speeding that up will be to have a sudden increase in houses on the market as short sales.'' He predicted that would increase already bloated inventory levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the summer months, it was the lowest- and highest-priced categories of home -- under $400,000, and over $2.5 million -- that had the biggest increases in inventory. There were about 50 percent more homes sitting on the market in both categories than in the previous year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said that the inventory bloat would most likely spread to the midpriced home category if the market continued to stagnate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of August, rural Salem County in southern New Jersey had the highest inventory rate: a 45.9-month supply of homes to sell, according to Mr. Otteau's statistics. Middlesex, Union and Essex Counties had the lowest inventories: 9.5, 9.5 and 10.2 months, respectively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Market specialists say a six-month inventory indicates a healthy market, in which buyers and sellers have relatively equal bargaining power. Inventory in Hudson County swelled to 15.7 months by the start of September; that is virtually the level it reached in January 2009, when sales froze.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fort Lee in Bergen County had 17.4 months' supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Millburn, which includes the wealthy Short Hills section, had a 4.9-month inventory, much lower than surrounding towns in Essex County. Other towns doing better than average were Livingston, with 4.2 months, and tiny Glen Ridge, with only 3.3 months.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ROOM service on demand from a celebrity chef. A maid to make the bed with fresh linens every day and leave a chocolate on your pillow at night. An 11,000-square-foot spa an elevator ride away. All yours with the purchase of a luxury condo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly a dozen projects in and around New York City that offer perks like these have recently opened or are nearing completion. For developers from Hoboken to Harlem, Williamsburg to SoHo, a condominium with a hotel attached is one more weapon in the reignited amenities arms race.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For buyers, the concept of a home with all the comforts of a hotel may seem like paradise. But hotel services don't come cheap: the developers of condo-hotels plan to charge as much as 20 percent more per square foot than high-end competitors that don't have hotel partners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And along with room service can come hotel-like bills, not to mention higher monthly maintenance fees. Financing can also be more difficult to secure; banks are leery of lending money for what could appear to be strictly investment property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dolly Lenz, the vice chairman of Prudential Douglas Elliman, said that at the same time they fantasize about dialing up club sandwiches at midnight, prospective buyers should take into account the possibility that the price of the amenities could go up over time. ''It might be included for a year or two years,'' she said. ''Three years from now the kicker hits them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel, said, ''The key factor to remember is that these properties were conceived in a different market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There was a lot of creativity because there was essentially free capital,'' he added. ''Developers needed to be aggressive to get higher and higher prices per square foot. The question now is if the math still works.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is an open question, and one that hinges as much on the hotel business as the broader real estate market. Hotel occupancy has been steadily increasing in recent months, with 89 percent occupancy in August and an average room rate of $227, according to NYC &amp; Company, the city's official marketing, tourism and partnership organization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that is far from the more than the $300 a night commanded by hotels before the economy faltered. There is also more competition now. In 2010, 21 hotels have opened, or will, across the city; that adds more than 6,700 rooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of these projects, at least 10 include condominiums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is too early to draw any conclusions about their viability. Some have sold below initial expectations, while others have increased their prices since coming on the market. Prices for units in condo-hotels range from $300,000 to more than $18 million -- $680 per square foot to nearly $4,000 -- with yet more properties in the pipeline. The various projects are aimed at a wide range of consumers, from Manhattanites who are downsizing in cost but not comfort, to foreigners for whom New York is a good buy right now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in their scale and ambition, which real estate experts say is unlikely to be matched in coming years now that financing is so hard to shake loose, the condo-hotels are already having an impact. Brokers and developers say some strictly condominium projects are stepping up amenities partly in response to the condo-hotel phenomenon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Edge, a new condo in Williamsburg, devotes 40,000 square feet to perks like yoga studios, a spa and basketball courts. On the Upper East Side, developers collaborated with Miraval, a resort and spa in Arizona, to create a 41-story complex that offers ''sanctuary-esque'' homes, and amenities like a pool and a rock-climbing wall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The newer condo-hotels are not to be confused with condotel projects like the 1997 Trump International Hotel and Tower. A condotel customarily allows its condo owners to rent out their units as income-producing hotel rooms, an arrangement that often attracted investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with banks now wary of lending to buyers of investment properties, some real estate analysts and brokers have declared the condotel dead, although the developers of the Trump SoHo on Spring Street and Varick would disagree. The condos of the condo-hotel combinations are being marketed to buyers as homes to be lived in and the hotel amenities that come with them as lifestyle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Residences at the Williamsburg in Brooklyn divided its project into three buildings, two of which are made up of condos and one of which is the hotel, so that buyers would have an easier time getting mortgages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My understanding is that it has been harder for buyers to get financing in mixed-use properties,'' said David Maundrell, the president of apartmentsandlofts.com, which is marketing the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, he said, with construction proceeding, 20 of the 57 condos are in contract, ranging in price from $455,000, for a one-bedroom, to $1.56 million for a three-bedroom -- about $780 per square foot, the upper end of the Williamsburg market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We wanted to make it clear that we are not a 'condotel,' but a hotel with condominiums,'' Mr. Maundrell said. Owners at the Williamsburg have access to housekeeping services, a rooftop bar with views of Manhattan, discount hotel rates for friends and family and, for an extra $30,000, private cabanas on the condo's rooftops, ''like in South Beach.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Williamsburg has plenty of luxury condos, it is lacking in hotel space, so the developers hope to get top dollar -- $300 a night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We believe there is value here because it is the first property of its kind in Brooklyn,'' Mr. Maundrell said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The condo-hotel concept is also coming to Harlem, with the opening of Apex at the Starwood Aloft Hotel at 2300 Frederick Douglass Boulevard, at the corner of 124th Street. The 44 Apex condos, above the 124 hotel rooms, range from 476-square-foot studios, for $300,000, to 1,767 square-foot three bedrooms for just over $1 million -- an average of $600 per square foot. Sales are expected to begin next week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have been very cognizant of setting it up so whatever amenities the hotel has, we can offer to our residents,'' said Richard Gorsky, who is leading RCG Longview, the development team. Unlike many of the other properties, this one will not have room service for condo owners, because there is no restaurant. Owners will, however, have access to the hotel's gym, parking and rooftop deck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers of the Apex are still negotiating with the Federal Housing Administration so buyers can secure cheaper F.H.A. loans. Condo-hotel properties elsewhere in New York City are usually too expensive to qualify for such loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers have been encouraged by the sales at the W Hoboken. Since the condo-hotel opened in 2009, 38 of the 40 condos have sold, with prices ranging from just under $1 million to $2.5 million, records for the neighborhood, according to Michael Barry, the developer and owner of the property through his company, Ironstate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the beginning, he said, buyers were encouraged ''not to look at this as an income-producing investment.'' The condos were not marketed to people who wanted to be a ''mini-hotelier,'' he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While projects in Harlem, Hoboken and Williamsburg are testing new markets, most of the projects are in pricier Manhattan neighborhoods, where the investment is greater, the competition stiffer and the sale prices higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 57-story Setai Fifth Avenue, a condo-hotel between 36th and 37th Streets, has faceted windows and a lighted steel crown designed by Gwathmey Siegel &amp; Associates, and is asking nearly $4,000 per square foot. The developer, Bizzi &amp; Partners, would not divulge sales figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Setai's condos come with access to a host of amenities, including what the building's Web site refers to as ''the blissful experience of exceptional service.'' Then there is the ''aquatic area'' in the 11,500-square-foot spa: ''two experiential showers, a vitality pool, sauna, steam, an ice cave and a social hammam,'' an elaborate saunalike room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Solly Assa, the owner of Assa Properties, which developed the Cassa Hotel and Residences in Midtown, said that although the mainly foreign buyers at his property were willing to pay $950,000 to $18 million for the condos, they were looking to save money on carrying costs. So the Cassa will offer many of hotel amenities ''a la carte'' instead of including them in the common charge. The lower monthly fees, starting at about $1,200, are one reason the apartments have sold quickly, allowing him to raise prices three times already, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the 57 residences for sale, 40 are in the process of closing, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We understand that it is a new era,'' Mr. Assa said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another Combo</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE Trump SoHo stands apart from the current crop of condo-hotels because it more closely adheres to the ''condotel'' model.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Donald J. Trump helped create that model in the 1990s with the Trump International Hotel and Tower and it is his company that is managing the new Trump SoHo; the developer is the Bayrock/Sapir Organization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Trump SoHo, zoning restrictions limit buyers to stays in their units of no more than 120 days a year. The hotel treats the units like ordinary guest rooms when the owners are not in residence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rodrigo Nino, the president of Prodigy International, the sales and marketing company for Trump SoHo, said that all 391 hotel suites are for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Over the past three months, we have closed on 23 units, with gross sales of $30 million, averaging $10 million in closings a month,'' Mr. Nino said. ''The average price per square foot is $2,516.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The amenities include an 11,000-square-foot spa with a hammam, an outdoor pool and a nightclub where owners are waved through the velvet ropes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the Trump name has come Trump-sized attention. The real estate blog curbed.com has written more than 100 posts on the property, chronicling rebates for aggrieved investors, controversy over sales figures, and a $20 million infusion of capital to offset slow sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The SoHo Alliance, a neighborhood group led by Sean Sweeney, challenged the project from the beginning. ''We told him we were going to slap him in the face,'' Mr. Sweeney said of Mr. Trump, ''and he got his face slapped.'' Mr. Sweeney believes his group helped scare off investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Trump dismisses Mr. Sweeney out of hand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't know who he is,'' he said, ''but the alliance's sole function was to try and stop the project from being built, and they failed. The building is open and operating and doing a fantastic business.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE story of the national housing market -- and the somewhat less tumultuous New York City subplot -- has been one of great extremes: bubbles, booms and busts, crashes and comebacks, misery and euphoria.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So what to make of it now? After weeks of gloomy national news fanning fears of a double dip in the market, New York City's largest brokerage firms are reporting something of a rebound and, with a sense of relief, even a possible state of stability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is too soon to tell about a return to normalcy,'' said Noah Rosenblatt, an independent broker who publishes real estate data on his Web site, UrbanDigs, and has been analyzing recent property listings, new contracts and sales. ''It looks to me that we hit the bottom'' in the sales slump that drove home prices down, he said, and that ''activity is starting to really pick up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The major brokerages agree: prices, while low, are holding steady; inventory over all appears to be at a relatively healthy level; and sales have risen substantially over the last six months. The exception was a slightly slower-than-normal summer, but it came after a slightly better bonus season earlier in the year, and there are now reports of a more typical post-Labor Day upswing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prospect of a return to seasons in real estate -- a busy spring and fall, slow summer months and a sleepy market during the holidays, followed by bonus-driven sales from the start of the year to spring -- is itself cause for some muted celebration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dorothy Herman, the president of Prudential Douglas Elliman, said: ''It's going to be a good year for us; people may actually move this year. In 2009 they were afraid to do anything. They would look but wait for prices to drop. People actually pulled the trigger in 2010.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Diane M. Ramirez, the president of Halstead Property, said that things were also looking a little less grim for sellers. ''When you open the newspaper and you read what's going on nationally, then people get very anxious,'' she said. But, she said, she is seeing something unfamiliar in the recent market: an apartment ''you may have loved yesterday'' was sold to someone else, and perhaps buyers will have to move faster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While no one is doing cartwheels, analysts cautiously agree with this sunnier picture. They do, however, emphasize some caveats, including the stubbornly high unemployment rate (New York City's rate is marginally lower than the national average, and it has been on a steady decline), tight credit and an overall economy that is not exactly poised to fuel an imminent housing comeback.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Things are stabilizing, and everybody's thinking, 'Hey, we're back, the worst is behind us,' '' said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the Miller Samuel appraisal firm, who also prepares the quarterly market reports for Prudential Douglas Elliman. ''A year has passed and people haven't felt like they were standing right on the abyss.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added, though, ''We're in a far better place than we were, but we still have a ways to go.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While it is still clearly a buyer's market, supply and demand may be starting to come into equilibrium, Mr. Rosenblatt said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many apartments, however, are still selling below list prices. Ms. Ramirez said the gap between asking price and accepted offers continued to be widest in the luxury market, which she defined as apartments listed for at least $3 million. For less expensive one- and two-bedrooms, she said, sellers are receiving 92 to 98 percent of the asking price; for the high-end units, the offers are at least 8 percent lower, with much more negotiating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pamela Liebman, the chief executive of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, shared the views of her colleagues, saying, ''we're at this new normal market.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She noted that she had seen a significant turnaround in the troubled new-construction market, with new units now selling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hall F. Willkie, the president of Brown Harris Stevens, said that his company was seeing many more renters who had been priced out of the market looking to take advantage of low sales prices and buy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and other brokers said that although real estate investment from foreign buyers had fallen off, it was now beginning to pick up again, driven largely by Russian, European and Chinese buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm very encouraged,'' Mr. Willkie said. ''I don't think we're back to the heydays, but it's a healthier market in many ways. But we're cautious. We will follow the general economy, and if that falters a great deal, we're going to feel it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chris Phoenix and Mary S. Park, a couple in their early 40s, have been looking for a Manhattan apartment in the $1 million price range for the last three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They are taking a view on the market that Mr. Miller says is the smartest: the long one. And they sound mostly impervious to the manic-depressive swings in real estate, expressing the kind of consumer confidence that brokers hope will be contagious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Regardless of whether it's a seller's or a buyer's market,'' Ms. Park said, she is confident that ''there is somebody who wants to sell something to us at a price point we are happy with, and we can sell it in the future at a good price.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Timing is everything.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I had originally planned to write this column last week, on the ninth anniversary of the terrorist attacks that brought down the World Trade Center, killing nearly 3,000 people who were working in the two buildings that awful morning. The topic is the economics of 1 World Trade Center -- the building, formerly known as the Freedom Tower, with one of the most tortured construction histories in New York history -- that is finally being erected at ground zero. When it is finished, it will stand 1,776 feet in the air, making it the tallest building in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With an expected completion date of 2013, 1 World Trade Center is the most expensive skyscraper ever constructed in the United States, with a price tag currently estimated at $3.3 billion. By contrast, the spanking new Bank of America Tower in Midtown Manhattan cost about $2 billion. That is pretty much the going rate for building new skyscrapers in New York City. Just to break even, 1 World Trade Center will require rents far higher than the going rate in Midtown, much less downtown New York, where the building is located and where rents are considerably lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since 1 World Trade Center is owned by the <span class="companylink">Port Authority of New York and New Jersey</span>, it seems fair to assume that any shortfall between the building's annual rental income and its carrying costs will most likely be borne by the people who pay the toll to cross the George Washington Bridge, or use the Lincoln Tunnel, or ride the PATH rail system, all of which the Port Authority controls. It also seems fair to say that no private developer in his right mind would build a $3.3 billion high-rise office building in a marketplace that tops out at $2 billion. Only a government entity would do such a thing. My plan was to question whether 1 World Trade Center really made sense for the city and its taxpayers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But I blinked last week. Even nine years later, the events surrounding 9/11 remain so emotional that it seemed somehow sacrilegious to ask tough questions about 1 World Trade Center on the day of the anniversary. Although the Port Authority claims it changed the name from Freedom Tower precisely because it wanted the building to be viewed as a commercial office building and not a civic symbol, it is difficult to rid the building entirely of its symbolism.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is, after all, going up on the same hallowed ground where the twin towers once stood. Part of the reason it costs so much is that its first 200 feet are reinforced concrete and steel -- designed to deter future terrorist attacks. (Another reason is that it will have a 408-foot spire, allowing it to reach that 1,776 foot mark.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as I discovered this week, I'm not the only one who's been blinking. It turns out that there are plenty of people, including former New York State officials and New York City developers, who believe that 1 World Trade Center is folly. ''An emotionally induced misuse of money,'' said one such person. ''You can only understand this as a political statement,'' said another. ''It makes no sense as a commercial real estate endeavor.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not one of these people, however, would go on the record; there was simply no percentage in it. As a result, the notion that a government agency would spend $3.3 billion constructing an uneconomical high-rise in a depressed market has drawn far less scrutiny than it deserves. Better late than never.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the twin towers went down, New York City lost 10 million square feet of office space. But the initial impetus to rebuild had less to do with reclaiming that lost office space and more to do with showing the terrorists that we wouldn't be cowed. Over time, however, as the rebuilding got bogged down in disputes over design and financing, it gradually became clear that the city didn't really need the 10 million square feet it had lost on 9/11. It had a glut of office space. Rents were falling. Especially after the bubble burst in 2007, commercial real estate developers struggled.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet there was never a moment when anyone in government was willing to question whether 1 World Trade Center -- with its 2.6 million square feet of office space -- still made sense. Former Gov. George Pataki pushed the Freedom Tower -- a name he came up with -- with every fiber of his being. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg never wavered in his support. Former Gov. Eliot Spitzer came into office professing to be more skeptical of the project, but did nothing to stop it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In those earlier years, the building's economics were even worse than they are now. In 2006, with no potential tenants in sight, the Port Authority actually negotiated deals with federal and state agencies to occupy parts of the building at above-market rents. In other words, taxpayers were going to take a hit so that the building could have some occupants. Thankfully, those deals eventually disappeared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, the building's economics are still nothing to write home about. One World Trade Center is going to cost somewhere on the order of $1,300 a square foot to build, more than double the cost of most new skyscrapers. And because it is what's called Class A office space, meaning that everything is top of the line, maintaining the building is also going to be very expensive. My real estate sources say they believe that the Port Authority will need to charge $130 a square foot to break even on the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But of course the Port Authority can't possibly charge anything close to that -- not in this real estate market or any market in the foreseeable future. The average rent for a downtown high-rise is $55 to $60 a square foot. Even if the Port Authority were able to charge higher, Midtown rents, it would still only be getting, at best, $80 a square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few weeks ago, the news leaked that the Port Authority was negotiating with Conde Nast to become a tenant in the building. Because Conde Nast is one of the most glamorous companies in New York, it would be a boost to the prospects of 1 World Trade Center to have it in the building. But it won't be economical: the Port Authority told me that, assuming a deal goes through, Conde Nast would most likely be paying the current market rate for downtown space -- that is, less than half what it needed to break even. It will also undoubtedly be locked into that rate for many years. Luring Conde Nast downtown is going to be expensive for the Port Authority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not surprisingly, the Port Authority disagrees with my analysis. It points to the fact that it has close to $1 billion in insurance proceeds that it is using to defray the cost of the building. And it says its break-even number is much lower than $130 a square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is not going to get a typical developer's rate of return,'' conceded Rich Gladstone, the Port Authority's point man on the project. ''But it will be cash-flow positive.'' He insisted that the commuters who pay their $8 a day to cross the George Washington Bridge would never have to support 1 World Trade Center. Of course that's easy to say now, with the building still two years away from completion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the Port Authority made another recent move intended to ensure the success of the building. It sold a small piece of the equity in 1 World Trade Center -- around 5 percent -- to the Durst Organization, for a reported $100 million. It is a great deal for Durst, one of the biggest and savviest commercial developers in New York. (It built the Bank of America Tower, for instance.) Its investment values the building at $2 billion, far less than it cost to build, so if it rises in value, Durst gets the upside. And in return for its $100 million, Durst gets to manage the building for the Port Authority, an arrangement that will allow it to reap fees for everything from finding tenants to reconfiguring office space. It is also a deal filled with a certain, undeniable irony, which has not been lost on anybody in New York real estate circles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You see, Douglas Durst, the company's 65-year-old patriarch, has been one of the few people willing to criticize 1 World Trade Center on the record. When the Port Authority was negotiating with those government agencies back in 2006, Mr. Durst told The New York Times that saddling ''already overburdened taxpayers of New York with the rent necessary to pay for it makes no sense at all.'' He even took out advertisements opposing the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When I called Mr. Durst this week, he did not appear to be exactly embracing this newest addition to the New York skyline, even though it was going to put money in his company's pockets. ''I've always been against it,'' he said. ''I have always felt that the private sector should develop and build office buildings'' -- not government agencies. He pointed out that the original World Trade Center, which had also been built by the Port Authority, took several decades to become even modestly successful. But, he added, since 1 World Trade Center was a done deal, it made more sense to have a company like his operating the building instead of the Port Authority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is a constant need for new office buildings,'' he said, in defense of the new building. ''The fact that Conde Nast is going to go down there shows that there is demand for it.'' As it happens, Conde Nast is currently a tenant in another Durst building, in Times Square, but Mr. Durst insisted that was merely a coincidence. To make the building work, he'll need a few more coincidences along those lines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We talked for a while longer about the building and its finances. Mr. Durst said he expected it to become cash-flow positive ''by 2018 or 2019,'' which struck me as awfully optimistic. Then, before hanging up the phone, he said, ''I want to reiterate that, as in the Times Square redevelopment'' -- another initiative he initially opposed before coming around and making a fortune -- ''I was against it before I was for it.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Updated Sept. 15, 2010</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the 50 most populated cities in the United States, Minneapolis has the highest percentage of actively listed nonforeclosed homes that have had at least one price cut since first going on the market, according to new data released Wednesday from the real estate site Trulia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Trulia, 43 percent of the listed homes in Minneapolis as of Sept. 1, not counting foreclosures, had their price cut at least once since first being posted on the site. That compared with 26 percent of the homes listed nationally. Following Minneapolis, 40 percent of the homes listed in Milwaukee had their prices cut at least once. Those cities were followed by Phoenix and Mesa, Ariz. The full list can be found on Trulia's site. Minneapolis and Milwaukee also came in at the top in recent months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly, last September, when 26 percent of actively listed homes had experienced at least one price cut, Midwestern and Southern cities were among the top spots. Jacksonville, Fla., held the top spot with 37 percent of homes listed there experiencing at least one price reduction. Milwaukee similarly came in second place last year, followed by Portland, Ore., and Memphis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tara-Nicholle Nelson, consumer educator at the site, said Midwestern and Southern cities probably have the highest percentage of homes with price cuts because ''these are largely cities that had no real bubble inflate, so they didn't have the hard burst and decline in values that most other areas had.'' This, she said, may have created unreasonable expectations among home sellers in those cities, leading them to put their homes on the market at ''unreasonable original list prices'' that then had to be cut. She also said she gathered such anecdotal evidence from talking with real estate brokers. For comparison, Detroit came in at the bottom this year, while Houston finished last during the same period last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among other data released by Trulia, the average price cut nationwide as of this month was 10 percent off the original list price, the same as last year this time. But Ms. Nelson said the data was just taken from Trulia's database and wasn't analyzed to ensure it was statistically significant. In addition, even though the price cut figures were similar for this September and last, she said traditional seasonal trends in the real estate market have been thrown off by government interventions like the tax credit. ''Even though we know the numbers year over year look quite similar, we also know the market forces were very different,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price change data was gathered from listings recently live on Trulia and tracks all price reductions from Sept. 1 of last year to this Sept. 1. Foreclosure properties, however, are not included in the data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How does the Trulia data square up with what you've noticed on price cuts on homes in your area?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Kenny Horowitz, a longtime worker in the fashion industry, decided to start his own business, he took a 10-year lease on a 10,000-square-foot showroom in 10 West 33rd Street, the Fashion Accessories Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I was in this building before with another company, Steve Madden, and my partner was in this building with a company called Rosetti,'' said Mr. Horowitz, whose company is called Latique Handbags and Accessories. ''We're a new company, and as such you feed off the traffic of the seasoned players in the building. But in an oddball building somewhere, you're not going to get that traffic.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Specialty buildings in Manhattan like the Fashion Accessories Center have fared better in the recession than the overall office market, some real estate brokers said. Owned by Adams &amp; Company Real Estate, 10 West 33rd Street is 98 percent occupied, which is the average occupancy rate for all 10 of Adams's specialty buildings, said David L. Levy, a principal of the company. Currently, the average occupancy rate in the Manhattan office market is about 88 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The tenants in a specialty building want to be there,'' Mr. Levy said, ''and that's why it does better in bad times. They're not going from building to building just to get the best deal.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Horowitz said he looked at cheaper spaces within a four-block area of 10 West 33rd Street but decided it was worth it to pay the slightly higher rate of $35 a square foot. ''We feel we can afford the extra rent,'' he said, ''because we're going to do that much more in traffic.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Horowitz said he worked for Kenneth Cole a decade ago when the company moved to a relatively remote building on 50th Street and 11th Avenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of people would only come to the building early in the morning or late at night,'' he said, ''never during the day when they'd lose an hour of commuting time. We lost a lot of appointments that way.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the commercial real estate world, a specialty building is one devoted to one industry, for example fashion, or a niche within an industry, like menswear. Manhattan's first specialty buildings may have originated in midcentury in the garment industry under the landlord Harry B. Helmsley, said Grant Greenspan, a principal of the commercial real estate firm Kaufman Organization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When I came into the business about 23 years ago,'' Mr. Greenspan said, ''there was a coat building, an outerwear building, a hat area -- you name it, they had different specialty buildings.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Greenspan said the theory behind specialization was that wholesale buyers in town on purchasing trips during market weeks could maximize shopping time by visiting many manufacturers in only one or two buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is still the case in buildings like 550 Seventh Avenue, an upscale fashion designer building, or 215 West 40th Street, the Denim Building. In bad times, specialization can insulate landlords from the tumult of the market -- as long as they are not in an industry that goes belly-up in a recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've seen that a specialty building doesn't have the extreme highs and extreme lows that a normal office building would have, fluctuating with the economy,'' Mr. Levy said. ''They have more of a steady income.'' In fact, brokers said, some specialty buildings were able to command up to 20 percent more than comparable space in a general office building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, with little turnover in most specialty buildings, landlords will typically not realize the extreme highs in rents in boom times, Mr. Levy said. ''In a specialty building, you really can't gouge the tenants when the market is roaring because you want them to stay as much as they want to stay,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least in the past, specialty buildings tended to be the older, smaller office buildings that did not typically attract the richest tenants. For instance, Steinway Hall at 111 West 57th Street was built by the Steinway &amp; Sons piano company in 1925 as a showroom for its pianos. Now the building, which is near Carnegie Hall, also provides offices for businesses in the arts, entertainment and education sectors, which often have limited budgets, said Mark F. Lauzon, a senior director with the commercial brokerage Cushman &amp; Wakefield.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The main benefit of specialization is it keeps the building full,'' Mr. Lauzon said. ''You'll get tenants who sign up because that's where they want to be, but you're not going to get top dollar from them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One major problem for specialty buildings is that an entire industry may collapse or move. For instance, 1115 Broadway, a building near the former International Toy Center, was being positioned by Adams &amp; Company as a toy specialty building earlier this decade, ''which was working out great for us until the whole toy industry basically moved out of New York,'' Mr. Levy said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An effort to replace lost toy tenants with companies involved in seasonal products like holiday displays was moderately successful, but that market is too limited, he said. Adams &amp; Company is now considering repositioning 1115 Broadway as a generic office building or a hybrid of seasonal product businesses and offices, said James Buslik, a principal with the brokerage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What we're trying to do is consolidate the Halloween and seasonal products into a portion of the space,'' Mr. Buslik said, ''and then we'll make the balance of the space multitenanted office space.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hybrid buildings, which might have two industries in them, or one industry paired with generic office space, are becoming a trend in the New York real estate market, said Christel Engel, a senior managing director with the New York office of the commercial brokerage Colliers International.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not necessarily a pure specialty building any longer,'' Ms. Engel said. ''It's going to be a semi-specialty building with an additional component. Those types of hybrids are starting to appear all over the place.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hybridization provides the boost to occupancy that specialization offers, but insulates the building from the collapse of an industry, Ms. Engel said. A good example is 57 West 57th Street, where part of the building is used by professional medical offices and another part by entertainment companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tenants from two different industries typically do not require separate entrances, lobbies or elevators but, Ms. Engel said, those in the same industry wanted to be together on a floor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More frequently, brokers said they were seeing larger, newer buildings turn toward specialization, and some developers have even proposed constructing specialty buildings from the ground up. For instance, Gary Barnett, the president of the Extell Development Company, is building a 34-story skyscraper at 50 West 47th Street called the International Gem Tower for the diamond industry.</p>

</div><div class="author">By BOB TEDESCHI   </div><div>674 words</div><div>12 September 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STRUGGLING homeowners have found some refuge in short sales, in which lenders allow borrowers to escape foreclosure by selling a home for less than what is owed on the mortgage. Government programs offering incentives to both parties will push the number of short sales to 400,000 this year from 100,000 in 2008, according to <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span>, a financial consulting firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the jump in short sales has also given rise to a new form of fraud -- which, as a recent study by <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> suggests, could undermine the burgeoning practice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fraudulent short sales take many forms, but Frank McKenna, the vice president for fraud strategy at <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> and one of the report's authors, says one arrangement is more common than others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An agent for the borrower negotiates with the lender to obtain a low selling price for a property, then sells it to a ''straw buyer,'' or someone with whom the agent is affiliated. The agents are sometimes real estate agents, or employees of businesses that advertise as ''foreclosure rescue'' specialists, Mr. McKenna said. As the agent negotiates with the lender -- and unbeknownst to the original homeowner or the lender -- the agent arranges to resell the property at a higher price. The new buyers may not know that they could have obtained the property for a lower price. Or, even worse, they may be victims of identity theft, unaware that their financial information was being used to buy a home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other fraudulent transactions, a borrower might purposefully default on a mortgage he or she could actually afford. The borrower arranges to transfer the property to a friend or relative through a short sale, and the original borrower can remain in the home. The new owner can also transfer ownership back to the original owner through a quitclaim deed, Mr. McKenna said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He estimated that only about 2 percent of the short sales completed in the last two years were fraudulent, but said fraud was becoming more frequent. ''It's happening a lot more in this market because there are so many more short sales,'' he said. ''There's more opportunity to go after the quick buck.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> does not track the actual number of fraudulent short sales. Rather, it estimates the figure by identifying short-sale transactions in which the house was quickly sold or ''flipped'' to a new buyer, or resold for a vastly higher price. The company obtains and analyzes publicly available sales and financial information on most of the nation's home purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Florida, California, Texas and Arizona had the greatest number of suspicious short sales, according to the <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> report. New York ranked fifth, with roughly 5.5 percent of all short sales falling into the ''suspicious'' category. New Jersey ranked eighth, with about 3.3 percent of short sales categorized as suspicious. In Connecticut, the percentage of suspicious short sales was close to zero.Mr. McKenna said the rising number of suspicious short sales could undermine the use of these transactions as a foreclosure alternative. That, he said, would be unfortunate, since borrowers and lenders have only recently reported some momentum in successfully completing short sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But John P. Bonora, a vice president of the <span class="companylink">Fairfield County Bank</span> in Ridgefield, Conn., said he did not expect this to happen. Noting that <span class="companylink">CoreLogic</span> also sells fraud prevention services to lenders, Mr. Bonora theorized that its report might overstate the threat of fraudulent short sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'd forward the report to my folks and say you should have some of these things in the back of your mind,'' he said. ''But I don't think this report would deter us from doing a short sale.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Mr. Bonora said, the report makes him more suspicious of real estate agents who market themselves as foreclosure specialists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They're probably speaking with borrowers on a daily basis about foreclosures,'' he said. ''And people are opportunists.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REBECCA AND TRENT DUPAIX of Eagle Mountain, Utah, spent a year searching for their dream home. The couple, who have five children, considered 15 to 20 houses before finding ''the one.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They were thrilled when they closed on a $227,000, rock-and-stucco home with five bedrooms and two and a half baths in March 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But four months later, when a local television reporter was doing a story on housing taxes in their subdivision, the Dupaixs discovered that their sales contract included a ''resale fee'' that allows the developer to collect 1 percent of the sales price from the seller every time the property changes hands -- for the next 99 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mrs. Dupaix, 34, says she and her husband had no clue about the fee when they closed on the house. ''Of course we were upset,'' she says. ''We didn't know about it, and our closer at the title company didn't know about it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other buyers gutsy enough to venture into the battered housing market in the hope of scoring a bargain might be wise to check the fine print before popping open the Champagne and signing on the dotted line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A growing number of developers and builders have been quietly slipping ''resale fee'' covenants into sales agreements of newly built homes in some subdivisions. In the Dupaix contract, the clause was in a separate 13-page document -- called the declaration of covenants, conditions and restrictions -- that wasn't even included in the closing papers and did not require a signature.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fee, sometimes called a capital recovery fee or private transfer fee, has been gaining popularity among companies that have been frantically searching for new ways to gain access to cash in the depressed housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Developers are desperate,'' says David Steffensen, a lawyer and a former developer in Salt Lake City. ''They're facing projects that are upside down'' because the property value has fallen below the loan balance and lenders are refusing to refinance. ''It's a ticking time bomb,'' he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Freehold Capital Partners, a real estate financing firm founded by the Texas developer Joseph B. Alderman III, has been leading the charge. According to William White, Freehold's chief operating officer, the firm has signed up more than 5,000 developers who are adding the covenant to developments worth hundreds of billions of dollars that will be built out over the next decade in 43 states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many developers see the resale fee as a creative way to get new financing. They are hoping to one day use the trickle of cash from these fees as collateral for a loan, or to get cash up front if pools of the fees are packaged into securities to be bought and sold on Wall Street. Freehold has begun shopping the idea of securitizing the resale fees, much as subprime loans were packaged and sold to investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Someone selling a home for $500,000, for example, would have to pay the original developer $5,000. If the home sold again two years later for $750,000, the second seller would have to pony up $7,500 to the developer, and so on. Even if a home declines in value, the seller still must pay the 1 percent fee. Freehold gets a cut of the resale fee; if the fees are securitized, it retains a percentage of the cash generated from the securitization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Freehold's principals and lawyers have been aggressive in sales pitches to developers, but have declined to give details on their clients, securitization efforts or the company itself. Freehold moved its corporate office from Round Rock, Tex., to New York this year as it stepped up efforts to securitize the resale fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. White characterizes the resale fee as a win-win deal for the developer and the home buyer. The fees let developers spread out the cost of building the roads, utilities and other infrastructure across all homeowners in a subdivision, rather than just the initial buyers. As a result, he said, the developer can lower the initial price of a home to the first buyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, he says, a typical $250,000 home may be able to sell for about $5,000 less. ''The fee is a fair and equitable way to spread development costs, and results in lower costs to the average consumer,'' Mr. White says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ted Thieman, founder of the real estate developer Thieman Enterprises in Vandalia, Ohio, sees Freehold's securitization plan as the holy grail that will provide him with badly needed cash. He signed up with Freehold last year after lenders refused to provide financing for him to develop land in Dayton, Ohio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People are going bankrupt out here, and there's no cash flow in our developments anymore,'' he says. ''This is the only source that's available to us.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeff Moseley, founder of Badger Creek Development in Brunswick, Ga., says he signed up with Freehold after watching his business tank with the economy. ''I can't sleep at night,'' he says, adding that he had laid off all 32 of his employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is hoping Freehold's resale fee program will breathe new life into his business. ''I thought it was an intriguing and compelling story,'' says Mr. Moseley, who owns two development projects, encompassing about 220 lots.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under his deal with Freehold, he will get about two-thirds of the revenue from the securitized fees while Freehold and other parties will get one-third.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some developers are skeptical. Qualico, a Canadian company that owns Reytex Homes of Austin, Tex., turned down Freehold's sales pitch when it was buying land from a Freehold affiliate in Texas. Qualico wanted to use the land to build entry-level homes and didn't think the fee would fly with that market segment. First-time buyers are more likely than others to trade up and quickly sell a home, so the home often has little time to appreciate enough to offset the fee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The resale fee ''has disaster written all over it,'' says Rick Akin, partner of the law firm Akin &amp; Chardavoyne, which represented Qualico.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MR. ALDERMAN, 45, has a history in the real estate industry, dating back to 1990, that includes a few bumps in the road. In March 1994, he filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection for businesses that operated as Alderman Homes Inc. and First Quality Homes Inc., which had offices in Texas and Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has also held positions as either a senior executive or registered agent for seven other businesses, many of which the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts lists as ''not in good standing'' -- a designation applied when a company has either not paid franchise taxes or failed to file a tax report or both.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Alderman says that the businesses were deemed not in good standing because he or his accountant didn't file reports by the deadline and that no franchise fees are due. ''My credit is perfect,'' he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Negotiations involving Mr. Alderman have sometimes been contentious. Mr. Akin says he had ''tortured negotiations'' with Mr. Alderman in 2006, when Qualico was trying to buy two parcels of land near Austin from Mr. Alderman's development company. Mr. Akin says Mr. Alderman haggled over issues including who would pay to extend sewer and water services to the land tracts, as well as who would be reimbursed for building parks and streets in the subdivisions through the city's Public Improvement District program.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He wanted to be reimbursed for the money that we were going to spend for public improvements,'' says Mr. Akin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He says Mr. Alderman also did not resolve issues like easements and back taxes that affected the legal claim to the title. When Mr. Akin decided to cancel the purchase agreement on the second tract of land over title issues, he says he had to sue Mr. Alderman's company to get back his client's $1 million deposit. ''In the over 25 years that I've been doing this, he was one of the most difficult sellers I've ever dealt with,'' says Mr. Akin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dispute was settled out of court. Mr. Alderman says Qualico wanted to back out of both land purchases, but was allowed out of only one. He says the $1 million deposit wound up being applied to the first tract's purchase. ''If Mr. Akin believes that is hard negotiating, then so be it,'' he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A COALITION of real estate trade groups, including the National Association of Realtors, the American Land Title Association and the Center for Responsible Lending, opposes resale fees and is lobbying federal and state authorities to ban them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The idea that someone who has no ownership stake or interest can continue to collect revenue off of a property that they may have built up to 99 years ago exploits an already complex transaction and doesn't pass the smell test,'' says Justin Ailes, director of government affairs at the land title association. The fee could hurt real estate values in the future if buyers are reluctant to purchase properties that have a 1 percent fee attached.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The coalition wrote to the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, and to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span>, the Federal Trade Commission and others, urging them to bar the fees or use the consumer protection agency -- to be created by the financial overhaul -- to fight them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Often, the fee is within dozens or hundreds of pages of documents, and for some buyers, like the Dupaixs, it may be in a separate declaration that does not require a signature. Buyers may not be aware of the fee until the closing -- or, worse, when they try to sell the home years later and the fee shows up in the title search, Mr. Ailes says. If the seller won't pay the fee, he says, a lien is slapped on the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I am yet to find an owner that reads 300 or 400 pages'' at closing time, says Charlie Orden, a broker and owner of the realty office Re/Max Town Centre in Orlando. And even if they do see it at closing, few buyers are going to walk away from a home at that point. He says he has started looking for the clause to warn potential clients well in advance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Opponents have made some headway. The Department of Housing and Urban Development recently issued a letter indicating that the fees violated its regulations and that the agency would not insure mortgages on properties that included them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> is considering a proposal to prohibit the transfer fees on all mortgages financed by <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> and the Federal Home Loan Banks. And 17 states have either banned or placed conditions on the practice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some bankers say Freehold will have a tough time selling the idea to Wall Street. The uncertain economy and housing market have made it next to impossible to predict when and how often a home will sell, or where home prices are headed -- information that is needed to estimate cash flows to value the securities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And some worry that an all-out ban of resale fees by states or the federal government could make the securitized paper worthless.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dave Ledford, a senior vice president at the National Association of Home Builders, says he's not sure Freehold can deliver on its big promises. ''It's almost in the category of 'too good to be true,' '' Mr. Ledford says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. White dismisses the criticism as sour grapes. He contends that Realtors oppose the fee because homebuyers might pressure them to lower their commissions to offset it. ''Apparently 6 percent to a Realtor is justified, yet 1 percent to pay for roads and utilities isn't,'' Mr. White says. He says he believes title companies are worried that they might face legal claims if they miss the fee during a search.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for bundling the future cash flow into securities, Mr. White sees little risk. The fee represents ''a stable passive income stream,'' he says, that will be generated whether home prices go up or down. Even if the federal government or other states ban the fees, the ban would most likely apply only to future developments, not existing ones, he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. White says his firm encourages full disclosure of the fees. However, he was unwilling to disclose the names of the developers and residential developments that currently charge the fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, Freehold was the financing company behind the fee in the Dupaix contract. Even the home builder, Prestige Homes, wasn't aware of the fee, and demanded that the developer, Development Associates Inc., remove the clause from the paperwork, says Michael Cameron, the real estate agent who handled the sale for Prestige.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cameron says Development Associates amended the ''covenants, conditions and restrictions'' document without the knowledge of the builder or buyer, and didn't present the amended document at closing. He says Prestige pulled out of the subdivision after the incident. ''It's not good for the buyers, it's not good for our reputation, and quite honestly, we thought it was unethical,'' he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nate Shipp, owner of Development Associates, says he signed up with Freehold on the condition that Freehold securitize income from the fees and then pass on some of that revenue to his company so it could lower the price for buyers. But so far, Mr. Shipp says, he has not received any money from the arrangement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He says Freehold insisted that he add the resale covenant into the sales documents on all lots in his subdivision to qualify for its program. Because Mr. Shipp hadn't received cash from a securitization, he has been deleting the clause from the sales contract as each home is sold. He says the fees on the Dupaix property and about 11 others were accidentally left in. ''It was an honest mistake,'' he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AS for Mrs. Dupaix, she says a resale fee wouldn't necessarily turn her off of a home if the price were right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If she had known of the fee in advance, she says, ''we would have negotiated to get the price lower.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EAST ORANGE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE dozen or so rental apartment buildings strung along South Harrison Street here, statuesque beauties dating from the early- to mid-20th century, have seen alternating eras of glory, decline and resurgence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, a walk down sidewalks south of Interstate 280 and the Brick Church train station offers a quick kaleidoscope view evincing all those eras at once: some buildings look scruffy and semi-occupied; others look spruced and full-up. Two abandoned structures with litter- and weed-covered grounds stand hard by the newly opened Indigo 141, an ultramodern rental created via gut-rehabilitation of a formerly empty eyesore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At six of the structures, Nos. 106, 111, 120, 158, 179 and 243 South Harrison, a new landlord, Adam Mermelstein, said he was aiming for the ''lower middle class.'' That would represent a major step up for the buildings. After bank and <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> foreclosures against the former landlord, Mr. Mermelstein is grabbing them up, along with his partner in TreeTop Development, Azi Mandel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TreeTop is aiming to do with these 430 units what Newark officials have acknowledged it did with 550 units bought in Newark in 2007: ''Provide attractive, secure, and affordable housing in a location that has excellent transit access, helping to renew and stabilize a neighborhood,'' Mr. Mermelstein said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are restoring and upgrading -- but not to luxury level,'' he said. ''Formica, not granite. Ceramic tile, not marble. We are not looking to buck trends here. But everybody has standards of living, and we will be upgrading and maintaining these buildings to meet or exceed anyone's idea of middle-class standards.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, 111 South Harrison Street, an approximately 70-year-old building with 86 apartments, received a new roof, chair railing in its hallways, and new wiring beneath new plaster walls. A pair of tall glass entry doors with custom wrought-iron detail was ordered up to replace metal doors with tiny barred windows that called to mind ''the jailhouse,'' Mr. Mermelstein said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As was the case in Newark, TreeTop will either refinish or replace hardwood floors in all the East Orange buildings; kitchens and baths are all to be renovated. Each building will have a management office and a full-time superintendent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Monthly rents will be $900 to $950 for one-bedroom units, and $1,100 to $1,250 for two-bedrooms; that includes heat and hot water, Mr. Mermelstein said. Also, each of the buildings has garage parking, available for $50 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June, when TreeTop and its investment partner, the Phoenix Realty Group of Manhattan, completed the purchase of the first two buildings on South Harrison -- Nos. 111 and 243 -- 15 to 30 percent of the units were vacant. Some tenants living with broken elevators and leaky ceilings had stopped paying rent, Mr. Mermelstein said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But when you do take care of your property,'' he said, ''people start taking care of their property, too. When we were first working on the buildings in Newark, some people put graffiti on the walls. They'd put it up, we'd paint over it. Once that happens three or four times, it stops being fun, I guess, and people stop doing it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People who want a rougher atmosphere end up living elsewhere,'' he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Newark, TreeTop and an investment partner spent roughly $3.5 million on upgrades to two big, beaten-down buildings on Martin Luther King Boulevard. Those buildings, 15 to 30 percent vacant for years before takeover, are now fully leased; Newark's deputy mayor for economic development, Stefan Pryor, recently described them as ''housing assets'' for the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mermelstein, whose company had previously been a developer of condominiums in trendy Hoboken and in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, decided to find a long-term niche in ''turnaround projects involving so-called work force housing,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He described the company as intent on ''longevity'' as a landlord, and seeking to attract long-term tenants who feel they are part of a community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm not saying we will never sell these buildings,'' he said. ''We're developers, and someday there will be more projects. But we expect to hold on to them at least something like 10 years.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other developers in the area, including Patrick Morrissy, who runs a nonprofit housing agency called Hands that specializes in turning around neighborhoods in Orange and East Orange, said they saw positive momentum building on South Harrison Street -- although some noted the cyclical rise and fall of real estate conditions there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past few years, several other buildings have changed hands or been refurbished besides the six in the TreeTop project. East Orange city officials are moving toward designating the area a redevelopment site, Mr. Morrissy said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Indigo 141 development was created by Blackstone 360 of Newark. An apartment building at 174 South Harrison was recently renovated by Anthony LaFerrara, whose real estate company is based in Orange.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: October 3, 2010, Sunday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The ''In the Region'' article in New Jersey and Manhattan copies on Sept. 12, about a developer's effort to rehabilitate a group of apartment buildings in East Orange, misstated the age of 111 South Harrison Street. It was built in 1940, not the early 1920s. The article also misidentified the architectural style of the building. It borrows from several schools of architecture; it is not Art Deco. The second error was repeated in an accompanying picture caption.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I drafted my will four times this week -- not because I was obsessed with the macabre, but because I wanted to test how computer-generated wills would fare under human scrutiny.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I confess that I didn't have a will before I set out on this exercise, so I was a pretty good test case. Also, I was willing to endure what turned out to be a tedious exercise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So here's what I did: After testing four programs, I asked an estate-planning lawyer to look over the final drafts for errors or potential issues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The verdict? Only after I tested all of the online services and analyzed their differences did I really feel as if I had a solid handle on the options available to me and what might be missing. That's not to say that three of my four wills weren't perfectly fine legal documents. But even though they seemed easy to draft, I still needed a lawyer to help decode some seemingly standard clauses and their consequences in my home state of New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Laura M. Twomey, a partner in the personal planning department at <span class="companylink">Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett</span> in New York who reviewed my documents, pointed out, for instance, how my wills had different instructions on paying estate taxes (should I be so lucky as to owe them). ''The thing that most surprised me is how different your will comes out depending on what program you pick,'' she added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I've detailed some of those differences, and the potential consequences, below:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">QUICKEN WILLMAKER PLUS 2011 This program felt like the most substantial, given the sheer amount of information it provided throughout the form-filling process. Because the program is actually written by Nolo, which publishes do-it-yourself books and software for legal matters, it appears that Nolo is drawing from its vast instructional library. If you have a question about a specific issue, like how to choose an executor, you can dive into its easy-to-read legal manual.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And before you choose whom to leave your property to, the program encourages you to take inventory of what you own and describes what type of property actually passes through a will -- an important point because items like 401(k)s, I.R.A.'s and insurance policies do not (they go to the beneficiary named on the policy). Several lawyers pointed out that you might run into problems if you didn't properly coordinate all your assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, if you have minor children listed as the beneficiaries on your insurance policy, but you want their money to go into a trust, which is in the will, then you need to name that trust as the beneficiary on the policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Twomey also said that I left it up to New York State to decide how to pay estate taxes. That aside, the Quicken will seemed fine for the most straightforward situations: I want to leave my assets to my spouse, then my children or some other assortment of relatives. It was also cheap; the program costs $41.99 and includes other legal documents that complete the estate plan, including a health care directive and financial power of attorney.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Quicken also asked how I wanted to pay estate taxes, something I couldn't answer with confidence. It quickly became clear that anyone worried about these issues should consult a lawyer. And before you rule yourself out of that category, consider that the state estate tax is levied on assets above $675,000 in New Jersey and $1 million in New York. That could potentially affect middle-class families whose modest homes and retirement accounts have appreciated over several decades, or even someone with a large life insurance policy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LEGACYWRITER This was the only program that allowed me to account for future children. This is a neat feature for expectant parents, though another program said it left out the option because it could raise complicated legal issues. LegacyWriter also allows you to put the children's money in trusts to be released over time. Still, it took me a couple of tries to figure how to get the program to name a third layer of alternate heirs, beyond my husband and potential children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the first draft I created, if my husband didn't survive me and we had no children at the time, my assets would be divided among my heirs as defined by state law. And, as Ms. Twomey pointed out, ''Does anyone filling out these forms know who their heirs are? It's different under every state law, and what layman is going to know that?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She also questioned the way the will defined descendants. In this will, children born outside of marriage, and raised outside the family home, would not be considered descendants (like John Edwards's love child). That may not apply to most people, but what happens if you want your grandchild -- the one raised by your son's former girlfriend -- to be included? ''My concern is not so much that it is in there, but who is going to explain it to you?'' Ms. Twomey said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taxes could also be a potential issue. The LegacyWriter will instructs that any inheritance-related taxes owed on most assets passing outside the will -- like the I.R.A. or 401(k) -- will be paid by assets passing through the will (perhaps a home). So if you leave your home to your children and forget to make them the beneficiaries of your I.R.A., they may end up paying any estate taxes owed on the I.R.A. ''A lot of times, we would provide that taxes paid for property passing outside the will be paid from those assets,'' Ms. Twomey said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The program was easy to use, and its short explanations provided the answers I needed. It costs $19.95 and allows you to update your will free for 60 days. For $34.95, you also get financial and medical powers of attorney and a living will.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LEGALZOOM Co-created by Robert Shapiro, a lawyer who was part of O. J. Simpson's defense team, the service offered brief but instructive pop-up boxes throughout the questionnaire, along with a breakdown of how others answered a question.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similar to LegacyWriter, this will instructed that all taxes be paid from money or property assets passing through the will, which could be a problem in some situations. ''What has happened is that the spouse's money can be eaten up by the taxes owed on assets passing outside the will,'' Ms. Twomey said, ''even in cases where you are not talking about people of major league wealth.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I chose a package that cost $91.95, which includes shipping (it mails you a copy of your documents) and a year of free revisions. If you join the Legal Advantage Plus plan for $12.99 a month, you can have a lawyer licensed in your state review the documents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BUILDAWILL I had some technical trouble with thisprogram. I can't confirm whether it was my error or a technical glitch, but it didn't really matter because the result was the same. My four-page will did not include information on who gets what. Nor did it warn me that I either skipped an entire section or didn't save it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I appreciated its instructional tips, but only after speaking with Ms. Twomey did I realize what was missing. The program costs $19.95 and another $9.95 for storing the will.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even after you finish drafting your will, several lawyers told me, you have to be careful to properly conduct the will-signing ceremony. In New York, for instance, after signing the will, the writer must declare out loud, in the presence of at least two witnesses, that the document is indeed his will. And if the writer fails to do so? ''The will is invalid,'' said Austin Wilkie, a lawyer at <span class="companylink">Holland &amp; Knight</span> in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The instructions on all the programs I tested were generally clear, though Quicken was by far the most specific, followed by LegacyWriter. BuildaWill, on the other hand, made it seem as if I needed a notary to sign my will, though I did not. But you do need a notary to sign the self-proving affidavit, an optional form that lawyers recommend you complete. That way, your executor doesn't have to round up your witnesses after you die. LegalZoom didn't include that form with the will, though the other programs did.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People with more complicated situations have encountered other problems with online wills. Kathryn Stebner, a lawyer in San Francisco, said a client helped her uncle prepare a will and living trust on LegalZoom before he died of cancer. The uncle's financial institutions wouldn't accept the trust documents, and he wasn't able to complete his living trust before he died, Ms. Stebner said. The woman filed a class-action lawsuit against LegalZoom in June, contending that the company engaged in the unauthorized practice of law. Chas Rampenthal, general counsel for LegalZoom, said the company had never been found guilty of those charges, ''despite inquiries and lawsuits instigated by lawyers that are threatened by what they perceive as competition.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, humans are also fallible, and some lawyers said they had seen poorly written wills drafted by professionals. But a computer program can't ask you about your family relationships or tease out complex dynamics, like your daughter's rocky marriage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the biggest risk might be summed up by Phillip J. Kenny, a lawyer in McLean, Va., who said that one client came back to him after looking at a software package and said, ''I don't know what I don't know.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 15-story building that covers an entire block north of the meatpacking district looks more like a brick fortress than a sleek Park Avenue office tower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the owners put the building, at 111 Eighth Avenue between 15th and 16th Streets, up for sale, and are betting that the real estate market has rebounded to the point where buyers will pay a price worthy of a trophy, about $2 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors, brokers and analysts are divided over whether the listing will hark back to the era of billion-dollar transactions or represent an outbreak of irrational exuberance only two years after the financial crisis snuffed out the greatest real estate boom of all time. Whatever happens, experts say, the sale may amount to a verdict on the vitality of the New York market, or at least the appetite for big deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At nearly three million square feet, 111 Eighth is the fourth-largest office building in New York City (55 Water Street, with 3.8 million square feet, is the largest), packed with high-profile tenants like <span class="companylink">Google</span>, Nike USA, barnesandnoble.com, Lifetime Entertainment and Deutsch advertising. It is practically full, and next year it will generate net operating income of nearly $100 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There haven't been any sales of this size post-financial crisis,'' said Dan Fasulo of <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>, a real estate data firm. But, he said, ''it's a unique, mixed-use property in one of the best submarkets in Manhattan.'' He added, ''The real estate investment trusts will be all over it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Interest rates are low, and there are plenty of foreign investors and large private-equity firms with a stockpile of cash for bargains, especially in New York, which is regarded as relatively stable and one of the strongest markets in the country. But, Mr. Fasulo said, buyers will have to put up more cash than they did in the recent past, perhaps as much as $1 billion, a large risk even for deep pockets. The days when buyers could finance nearly the entire cost of a blockbuster deal are long gone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some investors, especially those who worry that the economy will dip again in 2011, say that real estate prices are already swirling too high. Douglas Durst, whose family owns 10 office towers in Midtown and recently bought a $100 million stake in 1 World Trade Center, described a two-tiered market of optimists and pessimists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's the market for those of us who stopped smoking a while ago,'' he said, ''and those who started all over again.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Douglas Harmon, a leading real estate broker who is managing the sale of 111 Eighth, said that even as the market improved this year, there had been few sales of high-quality buildings. He said 111 Eighth was unique in that it sits in a small but thriving neighborhood with a solid set of tenants whose leases do not expire for at least eight years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are very few investment options in today's market, where interest rates are at historic lows, that provide yield, safety and secure growth,'' said Mr. Harmon, a senior managing director at Eastdil Secured. ''This property provides all three, plus it's a franchise that acts as a hedge against inflation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some developers like Mr. Durst have refinanced their skyscrapers, but only a few buildings have changed hands, and none for the kind of numbers the owners are seeking. In May, SL Green, the city's largest landlord, sold its minority stake in the McGraw Hill Building on Avenue of the Americas in a deal that valued the tower at $1.28 billion, or $504 a square foot, about $175 less than the owners of 111 Eighth are hoping to get.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boston Properties recently paid a higher price, on a per-square-foot basis, for 510 Madison, a smaller, newly completed office building without tenants. It paid $303 million, or $865.70 a square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building at 111 Eighth, which has 15-foot ceilings and unobstructed views, was built by the <span class="companylink">Port Authority of New York and New Jersey</span> in 1932 for port-related businesses and as its headquarters. Originally, there were drive-in elevators that could lift heavy trucks to the top floor. But by 1972, Manhattan's shipping and passenger piers were silent, and the Port Authority sold the building to a private company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1998, a partnership led by <span class="companylink">Taconic Investment Partners</span> bought 111 Eighth and three other buildings for $387 million. Paul Pariser, a founder of Taconic, said the partners began going after telecom companies like Sprint and Verizon that needed lots of power for their computers and switches, which now account for about a quarter of the space in the building. They also went after a diverse group of tenants, starting with the Deutsch ad agency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the meatpacking district to the south became less about meat and more about fashion, chic hotels and galleries, the building took on a new aura. It became home to <span class="companylink">Google</span>'s local headquarters, WebMD, <span class="companylink">Bank of New York</span> and Nike USA. Annual rents jumped from $20 per square foot to more than $50. And condominiums in the neighborhood sold for as much as $2,000 a square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taconic's current partners -- the <span class="companylink">New York State Common Retirement Fund</span> and Jamestown, a German investment group -- are looking to sell a 90 percent stake, or even the entire property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter G. Riguardi, president of <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> in New York, who is representing both the <span class="companylink">Bank of New York</span> and the <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> in their search for additional office space, said the market had improved since 2008, when vacancies soared and values plunged by 30 percent and more. But, he said, the future is unclear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're certainly not rolling backward anymore,'' Mr. Riguardi said. ''But when the dust settles, I don't know if there's going to be any positive absorption of space and an adding of new jobs. Without new jobs, we're not going to see growth in the market.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of all the uncertainties in our halting economic recovery, the housing market may be the most confusing of all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At times, real estate seems to be in the early stages of a severe double dip. Home sales plunged in July, and some analysts are now predicting that the market will struggle for years, if not decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others argue that the worst is over. As Karl Case, the eminent real estate economist (and the Case in the Case-Shiller price index), recently wrote, ''Buying a house now can make a lot of sense.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I can't claim to clear up all the uncertainty. But I do want to suggest a framework for figuring out whether you lean bearish or less bearish: do you believe that housing is a luxury good and that societies spend more on it as they get richer? Or do you think it's more like food, clothing and other staples that account for an ever smaller share of consumer spending over time?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you believe housing resembles a luxury good, then you'll end up thinking house prices will rise nearly as fast as incomes in the long run and that houses today aren't terribly overvalued. If housing is a staple, though, prices will rise more slowly -- with general inflation, as food tends to.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The difference between these two views ends up being huge, and it's become the subject of an intriguing debate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After digging into it, I come down closer to the luxury good side, which is to say the less bearish one. To me, housing does not rank with unemployment, the trade deficit, the budget deficit or consumer debt as one of the economy's biggest problems. But you may disagree.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one doubts that prices rose roughly with incomes from 1970 to 2000. The issue is whether that period was an exception. Housing bears like Barry Ritholtz, an investment researcher and popular blogger, say it was. The government was adding new tax breaks for homeownership, and interest rates were falling. These trends won't repeat themselves, the bears say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As evidence, they can point to a historical data series collected by Mr. Case's longtime collaborator, Robert Shiller. It suggests that house prices rose no faster than inflation for much of the last century.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pattern makes some intuitive sense, too. As people become richer, they spend a shrinking share of their income on the basics. Think of it this way: someone who gets a big raise doesn't usually spend it on groceries. You can see how shelter seems as if it might also qualify as a staple and, like food, would account for a shrinking share of consumer spending over time. In that case, house prices should rise at about the same rate as general inflation and well below incomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's the scary thing, at least for homeowners: if this view is correct, house prices may still be overvalued by something like 30 percent. That's roughly the gap between average household income growth and inflation over the last generation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's also the overvaluation suggested by Mr. Shiller's historical index. Today, it is around 130, which is way down from the 2006 bubble peak of 203. But it's still far above the 1890 to 1970 average of 94.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In effect, the bears are arguing that housing was in a multidecade bubble and has now entered a multidecade slump.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second, less bearish group of economists doesn't buy this. This group includes Mr. Case, Mark Zandi of <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Analytics and Tom Lawler, a Virginia economist who forecast the end of the housing boom before many others did. They say they believe that house prices rise nearly as fast, if not quite as fast, as incomes, and that real estate is no longer in a bubble.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This side can also make a case based on history. Mr. Case points out that all pre-1970 housing statistics are suspect. By necessity, Mr. Shiller's oft-cited historical index is a patchwork that relies on several sources, like Labor Department surveys. These sources happen to paint a more negative picture of past house prices than some other data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, the Census Bureau has been asking people since 1940 how much they think their houses are worth, as Mr. Lawler noted in one of his newsletters. The answers suggest that house values rose faster than general inflation -- and about as fast as incomes -- not just from 1970 to 2000, but from 1940 to 1970, as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Likewise, Mr. Case has dug up sales records for houses in the Boston area that were built in the late 19th century and are still around. The records show prices rising 2.5 percentage points a year faster than inflation, which is just about what income has done.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps most persuasive is a statistic that Mr. Shiller sent me when I asked him about this debate. It shows that the share of consumer spending -- and, by extension, of income -- devoted to housing has not fallen over time. It has hovered around 14 or 15 percent for the last 60 years. The share of spending devoted to food, by contrast, has dropped to 13 percent, from 25 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These numbers make a pretty strong argument that the post-1970 period is not one long aberration. As societies get richer, they do spend more and more on housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of this spending, Mr. Shiller notes, comes in the form of bigger, more expensive houses. These houses don't do anything to lift the value of a smaller, older house -- which is what matters to individual homeowners. But McMansions are not the only factor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To see this, you can look at the share of consumer spending devoted to things inside houses, like furniture. As with houses, they have become fancier. But they haven't become so much fancier that they make up anywhere near as large a share of consumer spending today as in the past. That's a strong clue that the upgrading of houses themselves isn't enough to explain the increased spending on housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is? The value of the underlying land. Those Boston-area houses that Mr. Case studied did not change much over time. Yet their value did.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For a house whose location has any value -- in a major city or a nearby suburb, where a builder can't simply put up a similar house down the street -- the land is a big part of the equation. Over time, Mr. Zandi says, the value of that land should grow almost as fast as the local area's economic output or, in other words, with incomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The best advice for homeowners and would-be buyers may be to think of a house not as an investment, first and foremost, but as a place to live. If there is a good chance you will move in the next three years or so, you should probably rent. The hassles of buying and the one-time costs are just too big. Plus, house prices are not low in most places today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ratio of median house price to income is about 3.4, compared with a prebubble average of about 3.2. Given the economy's weak condition and the still high number of foreclosures, prices may well fall more in the next year or two. They look especially high in places where rents are comparatively cheap, like San Diego and San Francisco. And maybe income growth will remain weak for years, holding down home-price growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if you can imagine staying much longer than a few years, you should take some comfort in the fact that the bubble seems mostly deflated. Sometime soon, prices should begin rising again. They may not quite keep up with incomes, but they will probably outpace the price of food and clothing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, if only it were possible to be as sanguine about the economy's other problems.</p>

</div><div class="author">By SAM DOLNICK   </div><div>846 words</div><div>7 September 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>23</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing advocates, tenants and elected officials have declared a victory in the Bronx with the announcement of the sale of the mortgage on an apartment building that has been called the birthplace of hip-hop. The sale, which was financed with significant help from city agencies, was the first step toward bringing in new owners after what tenants called an era of neglect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group trying to take over the building, Workforce Housing Advisors, pledged to address the many violations and improve maintenance at the building, which had been highlighted by elected officials and tenant advocates as an emblem of New York's affordable housing crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hulking brick tower at 1520 Sedgwick Avenue has been a haven for generations of working-class families. In the early 1970s, a young resident named Clive Campbell, otherwise known as D.J. Kool Herc, held much-celebrated parties in the community room -- parties that played a crucial role in the early evolution of hip-hop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building was sold in 2008 to a real estate group that included Mark Karasick, a prominent real estate investor, as part of a wave of deals in neighborhoods that had long been ignored. City officials initially tried to stop the sale, saying that the financing was not viable, but they were not successful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the real estate bubble burst, the building's conditions deteriorated, leaving tenants to battle rats, roaches and the threats of foreclosure. Mr. Karasick's group tried to sell the building, affordable-housing advocates said, while housing officials sought to broker a deal of their own. Mr. Karasick's lawyer did not return a call for comment last week.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city's Housing Development Corporation supported WinnResidential, a real estate firm based in Boston, and Workforce Housing Advisors, Winn's local partner, as they expressed interest in buying the Sedgwick Avenue building. Workforce Housing Advisors, a new company, is run by executives with years of experience in important roles in city housing agencies. If they complete the sale, the Sedgwick building would be the group's first property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city provided a $5.6 million loan to allow Winn and Workforce Housing to buy the building's mortgage from Sovereign Bank for $6.2 million. The money came from a new $750 million city program to rescue distressed multifamily buildings from unsupportable debt by helping buyers deemed responsible by the city take over the troubled properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're serious about making sure that buildings don't destabilize and then destabilize neighborhoods as well,'' said Rafael E. Cestero, the commissioner of the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the city would pursue similar deals to ensure that affordable housing ''doesn't fall victim to people who are there only to make a quick buck.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gloria Robinson, president of the Sedgwick tenants' association, said the sale offered the prospect of much-needed relief.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It had gotten to a point where nothing was being done properly around the building,'' Ms. Robinson said. ''The garbage wasn't being picked up, the floors weren't being cleaned. It just got really, really bad. It's like we're starting fresh now.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">D.J. Kool Herc called it ''a great moment for 1520 Sedgwick Avenue.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a historic site,'' he said. ''This is where hip-hop comes from. This is it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maintenance should improve quickly -- the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, set aside $3 million in discretionary money to make improvements there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new mortgage owners have filed for foreclosure, which would allow the building to be sold at a public auction, likely to be held next year. City officials said they expected Workforce Housing Advisors to prevail, though they could not guarantee that they would offer the highest bid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representative Jose E. Serrano, one of the building's early champions, noted there were still hurdles to clear, but said, ''This is a strong victory because this is such a visible building.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The property sale will follow the model set by Omni New York, the real estate company led by the former Mets player Mo Vaughn. Last year, the city helped broker a deal for Omni to take over 14 buildings owned by the Ocelot Capital Group, an investment group that bought and then abandoned 25 Bronx buildings, which fell into disrepair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're going to bring the building back to a place where someone would be happy to live with dignity,'' said Kevin Gallagher, a director of Workforce Housing Advisors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Senator Charles E. Schumer called the building ''the birthplace of predatory equity.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This triumph stands as a message to others: beware,'' he said. ''It's a message to those owners or lenders who want to buy these buildings at exorbitant rates with the only purpose of kicking the tenants out and raising the rents.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I WAS born in Haiphong, North Vietnam. When I was 7, my family moved to South Vietnam. I had 10 brothers and sisters, so it was a struggle to attend school because of the fees. I managed to graduate from college with a degree in literature and foreign languages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the Vietnam War, I worked as a sales promotion manager in an American company in Saigon. I made good money but didn't save a lot. I didn't think I had much of a future in our war-torn country. Then I worked as a translator for the U.S. government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1975, when Saigon fell, my American contact found me and told me I needed to leave, for my own safety. My wife and I were among the first people airlifted out of the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After I was processed at Camp Pendleton, Calif., I found a job selling vacuum cleaners. I quit after three weeks. Then friends from my church pointed me to an assembly-line job at an electronics company. I decided I didn't want to do that for the rest of my life, either, so I worked as a security guard while I took a real estate course. I kept that job until I sold some houses and had some money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I started my company in 1978. For the first 10 years, I worked 16 hours a day, seven days a week. I had read a lot about the United States and felt I had a head start because I had worked for the government, but I wasn't optimistic initially.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The United States appeared to offer a lot of opportunity for those who had a strong technical background, but I didn't. I spoke to a jobs counselor at California State University, Fullerton, and started taking courses at different colleges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I studied business finance and business law, accounting, design and construction. I didn't care about getting a degree; I just wanted the knowledge that would help me in the real estate and development field. In one class, the professor started discussing development and I chimed in. He said I knew more than he did, and had me get up and teach part of the class.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first, less than 5 percent of my clients were Asian, but after five or six years almost all of them were. Competitors saw me as the new person trying to break in, and I experienced prejudice as one of the first immigrants from Vietnam. People had heard a lot of bad stories about my country, and we didn't fit in right away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Vietnam, if you didn't have capital, you couldn't even think about going into business. In the U.S., anything is possible if you believe it is. If people gain enough knowledge and can put a deal together, they can get financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I started developing an area that became known as Little Saigon, building properties like Asian Garden Mall and Asian Village in Westminster, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I've made mistakes, but somehow it has all worked out. In the real estate downturn of the early '90s, all I could do was to be honest with lenders. You're at their mercy, and you can't lie yourself out of the problem. Lenders need borrowers they can rely on. You have to be trustworthy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About a year ago, I was constantly hearing about the latest real estate downturn. The subprime mortgage debacle appeared to be a result of a capitalist country moving too far too fast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To survive, I stopped reading the paper and listening to the news. We're a smaller company today, but I'm more optimistic.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHETHER brownstone in Harlem, limestone on the Upper East Side or red brick in the West Village, town houses are a defining feature of many Manhattan neighborhoods. Yet they now make up less than 1 percent of the borough's real estate market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And with the high cost of land and the expense of development, the opportunity for new town house construction is rare, which is why a handful of projects in the West Village and SoHo that include town houses, are attracting notice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The developers and architects say they are propelling the town house into the modern era by providing the convenience and amenities of condominium living while working within the confines of historic neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conceived at the height of the boom but only recently put on the market, the new town houses could hardly be less alike in style. At Soho Mews, on West Broadway between Grand and Canal Streets, the steel and glass design pays tribute to the cast-iron buildings that dominate the neighborhood. Superior Ink, on Bethune Street between Washington and West Streets, adheres to the architect Robert A. M. Stern's nostalgic bent. And a block away at 385 West 12th Street, the developer/architect FLAnk has clad four town houses and accompanying condos in glimmering copper that will change color as it ages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One of the negatives of town houses in the past was that you also had to have a Jeeves,'' said Joanna Rose, the vice president of communications at Related, which developed Superior Ink, named after the factory that it replaced. ''We solve that problem.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One way that has been done, in all three cases, is to connect the town houses to condominium projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A century ago, a young real estate broker named Douglas Elliman persuaded Senator Elihu Root of New York to move from his comfortable town house on Park Avenue to a new, luxurious apartment building at 998 Fifth Avenue -- by cutting his rent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With its rusticated limestone exterior and elaborate copper cornices, 998 Fifth, designed by McKim, Mead &amp; White to evoke an Italian Renaissance palazzo, was soon hailed as one of the grandest structures in the city. Other prominent New Yorkers, including Guggenheims and Vanderbilts, soon moved in, setting off a transformation in urban living, said Michael Kovner, a vice president of Brown Harris Stevens who teaches a course on the city's real estate history for the Real Estate Board of New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his book ''Touring the Upper East Side: Walks in Five Historic Districts,'' Andrew S. Dolkart noted the transition. ''At the time 998 was built, apartment house living had not yet been widely accepted by the very wealthy, but as The Real Estate Record noted, 998 helped to change the 'deep-seated repugnance' that 'families of high social position' had for apartments,'' he wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then apartment living has been ascendant, but the sales success of the new projects -- even at $5 million and up -- indicates that New York's moneyed elite still like their private homes. The average price for a Manhattan town house in 2010 was $4.422 million, according to data provided the Corcoran Real Estate Group. The properties have held their value well in the recession, falling only 11 percent from the peak average price of $4.972 million in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One of the great reasons to buy a house is that they are really not making any more,'' said Patrick Vernon Lilly, a senior vice president of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span> who specializes in town houses. ''We are seeing a handful coming on the market, but generally, there are more lost to development than gained. It is a dwindling market and that keeps the prices of town houses very high, compared to the value of condos and co-ops.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The least expensive of the new town houses are at Soho Mews. Three of the five have already been sold, with the remaining two priced at $4.95 million and $5.675 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soho Mews was developed by United American Land. Albert Laboz, who runs the company with his brothers, Jason and Jody, said that until now they had largely focused on retail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just as developers turned to the star power of architects like McKim Mead &amp; White at the turn of the last century to draw in clients, Mr. Laboz hired Gwathmey Siegel &amp; Associates, perhaps best known for the addition to the Guggenheim Museum in the early 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Siegel, the principal and founding partner of the firm, said the challenge was to stay consistent with the ''vocabulary of the neighborhood'' without simply mimicking its surroundings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The facades of the buildings were conceived as a contemporary reinterpretation of the historical cast-iron and glass facades of neighboring buildings,'' Mr. Siegel said. This was accomplished, he said, by creating a large-scale grid of channel-shaped metal elements that frame frosted, clear and fritted glass. The development, built on a former parking lot, is made up of two buildings divided by a central courtyard, with the condos making up one building on West Broadway, and town houses the other, on Wooster Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lady Gaga showed up for a viewing at Soho Mews in what appeared to be underwear, and complained that there were too many windows, said Jessica Geiger, a spokeswoman at <span class="companylink">Dan Klores Communications</span>, the building's publicist. But Sean Sweeney, the director of the SoHo Alliance, a civic group, said the project was ''an architectural success'' and praised the developers for working with community leaders from the outset.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They did it the right way,'' Mr. Sweeney said. ''They came to us very early on with the plans and they asked for a meeting with the community, which in SoHo and downtown in general is a very smart idea because we are the Nimby capital of the country,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During construction, some neighbors did complain about damage to their properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Owners of town houses at Soho Mews can enter via the sleek lobby of the condominium on West Broadway, which looks like a hotel with its walnut concierge desk, and pass through the 4,000-square-foot courtyard on the way to their homes. Or they can use their own private entrances, oversized pivoting glass doors, on Wooster Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have worked with a lot of famous people and the thing that many of them want is anonymity,'' said Mr. Lilly of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>. ''They can slide into a town house and out of a town house without being recognized by other people in the building.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, many affluent buyers also want the amenities and services that come with being part of a larger development. And they are willing to pay a premium for it, including monthly fees ranging from $3,000 to $7,000 on top of the multimillion dollar purchases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For owners of the seven town houses lining the far west end of Bethune Street that are a part of Superior Ink, that means access to an entertainment room, a screening room and a gym. Just as at Soho Mews, rear entrances provide an alternative to the traditional front door. There is also valet bike parking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building in the West Village presents very different challenges, in part because town houses are an embedded part of the fabric of the neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Superior Ink supplanted one of the last factories in the area, which drew attention to the project from the start. The much smaller FLAnk project, on the other hand, replacing only Diane Von Furstenberg's mansion and another town house, did not attract as much notice, which is not to say that everybody likes the prominent copper facade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andrew Berman, the executive director of the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation, said that the demolition of older buildings to make room for the new developments was a loss for the neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Both projects turned out pretty much as we expected,'' Mr. Berman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Superior Ink town houses are a kind of historicist stage set, while the FLAnk project is more modern exhibitionism,'' he said. ''I miss the 19th- and early-20th-century factory buildings they replaced; but fortunately, while the city refused to landmark those buildings, we have been able to get much of the rest of the far West Village landmarked, and thus most of the neighborhood's remaining industrial and maritime architecture will be preserved.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two neighboring projects approached the modern town house in very different ways.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stern, who designed both the town houses and the larger condominium tower of Superior Ink, looked to the past, creating town houses reminiscent of those built 100 years ago. With red-brick facades, stoops rising to the front door, bay windows and curved metal railings, there is little to indicate that they have any connection to the tower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The people looking at these homes are not looking for the 'Austin Powers' kind of look,'' said Ms. Rose of Related.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The marketing of the project calls upon an idealized past in a hard-bound prospectus. ''The graceful, expansive floor plans, blend of lavish materials and subtle architectural details,'' it informs prospective buyers, ''display a richness and confidence that evoke the grandeur of earlier West Village eras.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kovner said: ''New money wants something bespoken.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The interiors of the town houses, which range from 24 to 29 feet wide, are also a throwback, with grand parlors for entertaining and dumbwaiters so that cooks and caterers can prepare food out of view.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are also nods to the way people live today: wide-open floor plans, midnight kitchenettes in floor-through master suites and landscaped rooftops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four of the seven town houses have sold, including one for more than $10 million to the designer Marc Jacobs. The remaining three are even pricier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just a block away on West 12th Street, FLAnk decided to go in a different direction, with asymmetrical walls of copper and glass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The building looks hyper-modern, but the spaces inside are much more warm than you might think,'' said Brett Miles, a broker with Brown Harris Stevens who is helping sell units in the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 12-story building is a combination of town houses and condominiums. With construction just being completed, three of the four town houses have already been sold for between $7 and $8 million. The last town house is priced at $7.95 million. Owners have access to a common rooftop garden, including a heated 50-foot lap pool and a whirlpool bath, which will be open year-round.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But technically, because the town houses are part of larger building, they are maisonettes -- which is itself a marketing term coined by developers almost 100 years ago to lure in apartment buyers.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHEN you see the words ''Bubble &amp; Squeak,'' what do you think of? A child's toy? Bathroom cleanser? Or does the traditional English dish of fried leftovers like potatoes and cabbage come to mind?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How about property in Chelsea? That is correct, because in addition to the dish, Bubble &amp; Squeak is the name of a small company that owns real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We started off with a loft building, and the building itself was a bit of a fried-up leftover,'' said John Dulfer, one of the owners of Bubble &amp; Squeak L.L.C. ''It seemed to fit quite well.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dulfer has since moved on to a brownstone in Chelsea, which is in much better condition, he said. But the name stuck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Most people don't know what it is,'' said Lori Feiler, a broker at Halstead Property who helps Mr. Dulfer find rental tenants. ''They say, 'What is that referring to? Does it have something to do with a bath?' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dov Treiman, a real estate lawyer, said the L.L.C., which stands for limited liability company, first appeared in New York State in the mid-1990s. They have been used in real estate transactions for a number of reasons, including liability protection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But they can also serve to shield one's identity, which has made them popular among celebrities. Deeds are a matter of public record, and if the name ''Angelina Jolie'' pops up on a condominium transaction, someone is going to notice. If she buys under an L.L.C. named, say, ''37 Ninos,'' perhaps not.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We absolutely advise people who want their identity confidential to buy in an L.L.C.,'' said Shaun Osher, the chief executive of CORE Marketing Group, a real estate brokerage firm. ''Most of the time, the L.L.C. name has some kind of a significance. Usually it's personal, but it has some meaning.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So who might have sold a building in Brooklyn under the name ''Shabbos Goy L.L.C.''? (A shabbos goy is non-Jewish person who helps out on the Sabbath by doing things that are forbidden to Jews.) And what might ''The Donkey Brothers L.L.C.'' signify? That possibly left-leaning company sold a condominium in Midtown Manhattan this spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent perusal of deeds in Manhattan and Brooklyn revealed a number of other gems, including ''the Worm In The Big Apple'' and ''Hot Potato.'' Some names are sweet, like ''Song For My Father,'' or ''Rabbit Properties.'' Others are a little aggressive, like ''Control The L.L.C.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pop quiz! What do these names have in common: ''Elroy L.L.C.,'' ''Astro L.L.C.,'' and ''Judy L.L.C.''?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer: ''Meet George Jetson ...''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firm behind those L.L.C.'s, which own buildings in the tristate area, is Cogswell Realty, L.L.C., a commercial and residential real estate company named for Cogswell's Cosmic Cogs, a competitor of George Jetson's employer, Spacely Space Sprockets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Arthur Stern, the chief executive of Cogswell Realty, the name did not come from a fanatical devotion to ''The Jetsons,'' but from a sense of fun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There was a competitive environment in 'The Jetsons' between Spacely Sprockets and Cogswell, and Cogswell was always on the victorious side,'' Mr. Stern said. ''There was one particular episode where they got into a zoning dispute, and it turned out that Spacely misread a zoning map. That was when we knew.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FLIP taxes have long been a necessary evil of co-op sales in New York. The fees, often imposed by co-op boards as a percentage of either the selling price or profit, have generally been borne by sellers. But now, in a weaker real estate market, there are signs that more buyers are being asked to shoulder the burden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A sale is less complicated when the flip tax is paid by the seller,'' said June Gottlieb, an associate broker and senior managing director at Warburg Realty. ''If it's paid by the buyer, it's an emotionally more complicated transaction.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the most part, buildings that impose flip taxes do not care who pays the fee, so long as it gets paid and goes into their coffers, though many these days are stipulating the fees are the buyer's responsibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lisa Breier Urban, a managing partner with the law firm Breier Deutschmeister Urban &amp; Fromme in Manhattan, said that stipulating the buyer must pay the flip tax could be a way to help sellers out in a slow market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Typically, if you know you're going to have to pay 2 percent out of pocket as a seller, you're going to add that into your asking price,'' Ms. Urban said. ''This way, sellers can keep their asking price a little lower, and the flip tax becomes a buyer payment.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flip taxes were first imposed in New York City in the late 1970s, when many buildings were converting to co-ops, and residents were induced to buy their units with artificially low purchase prices, said Arthur I. Weinstein, a co-op lawyer in Manhattan who serves as vice president of the Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flip taxes were created in case the buyers turned around and resold the units for huge profits. A fee amounting to a percentage of the seller's profits would ensure money in the reserve fund and a healthy building for those people who bought and stayed, Mr. Weinstein said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than three decades later, a more appropriate term for flip taxes is ''transfer fees,'' he said. And those fees, which now exist simply to replenish a co-op's reserves, come in many forms. One flip tax commonly seen is a percentage, generally 2 to 5 percent, of the gross proceeds of the sale. Another is a fixed fee based on a number of dollars for each share in the apartment being sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The original flip taxes -- and many which still exist today -- were based on a percentage of net profit, and that could be very substantial,'' Mr. Weinstein said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until recently, it was unclear whether condominiums could legally charge flip taxes, but ''that question has been answered in the affirmative, so some condominiums are now, late in the game, instituting flip taxes,'' Mr. Weinstein said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traditionally, if a building did stipulate in its bylaws who was to pay the flip taxes, it was the seller, he said. Nowadays, since flip taxes have nothing to do with fears of apartment-flipping, a building may stipulate that buyers must pay the flip tax, which can make adopting the fee or increasing it more appealing to shareholders, Mr. Weinstein said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You need a supermajority -- that is, more than 50 percent, either two-thirds or three-quarters of shareholders -- to approve a flip tax,'' he said. ''That political benefit of saying, 'You're not paying it, the buyer is paying it' might ease the passage.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In August, the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> proposed a rule that would prohibit <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and other agencies from buying loans in buildings with flip taxes. The proposal is largely intended to discourage developers from imposing covenants that would require buyers to pay them a flip tax when a home is sold for as long as 99 years, according to the Real Estate Board of New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is currently undergoing public review, and has evoked a quick -- and negative -- response from New York's real estate industry. Michael Slattery, the New York board's senior vice president, said its membership was organizing to oppose the proposal as written, though, he said, ''We're not unsympathetic to what they're intending to do.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As part of public comment, he said, ''we'll try to convey the experience in New York and how it's different from the experience they're concerned about.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether a building's bylaws stipulate who pays or not, the party who actually hands over the money is typically determined through negotiation, said Aaron Shmulewitz, a partner with the real estate law firm Belkin Burden Wenig &amp; Goldman. Even so, he said, ''in the vast majority of cases, the purchase price is adjusted in some fashion to reflect who pays the flip tax.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Gottlieb, who has clients in several buildings that stipulate the buyer pays, such as 860 and 870 United Nations Plaza, said that payment of the flip tax was a matter of ''semantics.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If it's paid by the buyer, they factor that into their offer,'' she said. One truism for brokers is that neither buyers nor sellers want to pay it twice on an apartment, added Nikki Field, a senior vice president with <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Sellers figure if they paid it on the way in, they don't want to pay it on the way out,'' Ms. Field said. In today's market it makes sense for buyers to pay the flip tax, as they ultimately benefit from the building's strong reserves, Ms. Field said. She also noted that flip-tax revenue had lessened in a slowing market, and that her lawyers had found the reserves in some buildings seriously depleted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What are they doing to make up for that?'' she asked. ''They'll have an assessment or they'll raise their common charges or maintenance fees.''</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">As Mayor, Brown Remade Oakland's Downtown and Himself</span>
</div><div class="author">By ZUSHA ELINSON   </div><div>1286 words</div><div>3 September 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>National Edition</div><div>17A</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During his eight years as Oakland mayor, Jerry Brown maintained the idiosyncratic lifestyle associated with his four decades in California politics: He slept on a futon on the floor of his downtown Oakland loft, had a Labrador named Dharma and sometimes performed his mayoral duties while wearing pants with holes in them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when he was in City Hall from 1999 to 2007, Mr. Brown pursued an agenda that supporters and critics alike describe as an exercise in hard-nosed big-city politics. In his quest to bring 10,000 new residents to Oakland's abandoned downtown, he cut generous deals with developers, streamlined the approval process and pushed aside city officials who stood in the way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also alienated some of his traditional base, progressive and black leaders who derided his policies as ''Jerryfication'' and accused him of abandoning the rest of the city for his downtown dreams.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A look inside Mr. Brown's 10K Project -- his plan to attract 10,000 people to live downtown by 2001, which was the cornerstone of his tenure as mayor -- reveals the transformation of his political career. Ultimately, it helped lead to his latest candidacy for governor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Jerry Brown is an interesting animal,'' said Ignacio De La Fuente, who served as City Council president during Mr. Brown's terms. ''He has come from the liberal hypothetical philosophical guy to a guy that learned that the only way to get stuff done is pushing the system.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wilson Riles Jr., a former councilman who lost a bid to unseat Mr. Brown in 2002, said Mr. Brown decided to become mayor ''to change his image from Governor Moonbeam to an image of someone who can get down and dirty and make change in a tough urban city.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I would say that Oakland definitely did more for Jerry than Jerry did for Oakland,'' Mr. Riles said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Brown's 10K plan is still incomplete nearly four years after he left Oakland to become the state's attorney general. The city has said it will take 6,000 new units to house 10,000 residents. To date, 3,549 units have been completed from projects approved during the Brown years. Another 310 are under construction. More than 2,149 have been approved but have yet to be built. According to the city, they are stalled by the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no official count of new residents, but Mr. Brown's efforts have certainly changed downtown Oakland. Empty parking lots have been transformed into apartment buildings. New bars, restaurants and the refurbished Fox Theater -- financed in part by the city under Mr. Brown -- have spurred night life and a growing arts scene.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I saw that we had the transportation to build a vibrant center, and that was my goal,'' Mr. Brown said in an interview this week. ''We needed housing and not just for people that are hanging on or people who live on subsidies, but people who have disposable income that can go to the art galleries and restaurants.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Brown said that the only way for Oakland to rebound was to get money flowing from private developers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Maybe some people think it was anti-progressive,'' he said. ''I'm just telling you I don't have that ideological baggage.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Brown expanded his office's powers with the so-called ''strong mayor'' measure. He put his allies on the Port and Planning Commissions and endorsed City Council candidates who favored his agenda.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Brown shook up Oakland's planning process to get projects approved faster. In 2003 he ousted Leslie Gould, the policy-focused planning director, replacing her with Claudia Cappio, a development director who had served in a similar position in fast-growing Emeryville. He also successfully lobbied the state to exempt more Oakland projects from the state's lengthy environmental review process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He focused his planning department not on policy, not on zoning, but on getting deals done,'' said Jane Brunner, the current City Council president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The centerpiece of the 10K project is the Uptown, three low-rise buildings with a modernist flair, built by the national developer Forest City. Mr. Brown courted the company -- and made a deal to give it a $61 million subsidy to build in Oakland. The project was approved in 2004 by the City Council and opened in 2008 across the street from Sears on Telegraph Avenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the 665 units in the Uptown, 638 have been leased, according to the company. The Uptown was at one time slated as a condominium project, but like many other 10K projects, the owners turned the units into rentals after the economy soured.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike Ghielmetti, president of Signature Properties, said Mr. Brown opened the doors of City Hall to developers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He was very accessible,'' said Mr. Ghielmetti, whose projects included the Broadway Grand building and a 3,100-unit development that has yet to be built. ''He listened to the business community and didn't necessarily agree with everything we had to say, but he tried to make sure that if there were just bureaucratic issues, that things got taken care of.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, advocates of affordable housing felt that Mr. Brown slammed the door on them. They sought an inclusionary zoning policy that would have required a certain percentage of units in each new development to be made affordable to low-income residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are the only major Bay Area municipality without an inclusionary zoning ordinance,'' said Junious Williams, Jr., chief executive of the Urban Strategies Council. ''Had we had something during the period of the economic boom, I'm not sure it would've dissuaded people from developing because Oakland was still such a deal. It seemed like a natural win-win.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end, community organizations like the Urban Strategies Council fought the city to get affordable housing included in individual projects like the Uptown, which built 25 percent of its housing to be affordable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The problem is that the local issues aren't heard beyond Oakland,'' said Mr. Riles, the former mayoral opponent. ''What they hear is that here's this good liberal guy doing moderate things for the business community, but you don't hear about the details, the big subsidies to the developers, the issues with gentrification, the local and minority contractors who didn't get work.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Brown said that what he did ''was necessary for Oakland,'' saying that each city is its ''own organism.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meg Whitman, the Republican gubernatorial candidate, rarely mentions the 10K project. A spokeswoman for her campaign said that ''Jerry Brown can try and debate his philosophy'' and then questioned him on his views on taxes. The Whitman campaign has focused on Mr. Brown's record on education in Oakland, which was not as notable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the race for a new Oakland mayor in full swing, Mr. Brown said he was supporting Don Perata, a more conservative Democrat, who is supported by businesses and the police union. Mr. Perata, a strong-willed politician who ran the State Senate, was the target of a now-closed, five-year F.B.I. investigation into kickbacks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We need a strong hand at the tiller,'' Mr. Brown said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Mr. Brown was asked if Mr. Perata would run Oakland as he had, the former mayor said, ''I think he will.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added, ''I have certain unique qualities, and I am not a deal maker in that sense.''</p>

</div><div class="author">By RACHEL CROMIDAS   </div><div>1281 words</div><div>3 September 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>National Edition</div><div>17A</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Margo Strotter considered herself proof that the revival of Bronzeville was under way. She opened a sandwich and smoothie bar at 45th Street and Cottage Grove Avenue in early 2006 and waited for other businesses, inspired by a booming real estate market, to follow her lead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four years later, she and Nicole Jones, owner of the designer shoe store next door, are still waiting. No new stores have opened among the empty lots on their street corner since 2008, when development was stalled by the credit crisis and the city's failed Olympics bid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Strotter and Ms. Jones -- along with the owners of a jewelry boutique, a coffee house and a menswear store -- are among the commercial pioneers who tried to cash in on the buzz surrounding the South Side neighborhood that was once blighted by high-rise housing projects. Now their ventures are a cautionary tale: They are struggling to stay open and instill a sense of community on a street that is quiet during the day and has little sign of night life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bronzeville is one of many West Side and South Side areas that lured developers eager to take risks at the height of the national real estate boom. Revitalization of the South Loop was well under way by 2004 and attracted new restaurants, condominiums, coffee shops and a Target store. Speculators began looking at the depressed land prices in neighborhoods from North Lawndale east to South Shore and north to Edgewater.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The boom petered out before everybody could make realistic investments,'' said Garth Taylor, a senior research fellow at the Metropolitan Chicago Information Center. ''The risks became unreasonable.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chicago developers, Mr. Taylor said, ''would rather force another 50,000 square feet of unwanted retail in the middle of Lincoln Park.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Strotter is one of a dozen black entrepreneurs since 2003 who have started businesses on the south end of the Cottage Grove Corridor. Their vision was to recreate the ''Black Metropolis'' of the 1950s, when Bronzeville was a bustling center of Chicago's black middle class and a renowned night-life destination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everything was here, the butcher, the baker,'' Ms. Strotter said. ''After church, you might go to the skating rink, the theater.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That legacy, plus the area's location near downtown and the lake -- and its desirable housing stock -- were among the reasons the entrepreneurs decided to locate there. Ms. Trotter was also encouraged by a local community development group started by Alderman Toni Preckwinkle (4th Ward).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a booming real estate market and Grand Boulevard's crime rates falling after demolition of Chicago Housing Authority high-rises, the commercial possibilities were promising: a sports bar, a fitness club, a shopping mall, a supermarket.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers spread their blueprints across the tables of Ms. Strotter's cafe -- the only sit-down restaurant for blocks -- to map their plans for Bronzeville's transformation. They were interested in the empty lot across the street and another one two blocks south. They promised they would be back, but they have been slow to return.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Vacant lots were on the verge of being developed and were going to be worth millions of dollars,'' said Steven Rogers, director of the Levy Institute for Entrepreneurial Practice at Northwestern University. ''Now they won't be developed for the next three years.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The juxtaposition of boarded buildings and new condominiums in the far North Side Edgewater community and the South Side's South Shore tell a similar story of boom and bust, Mr. Rogers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as the financial crisis neared, developers were willing to make financial bets on former West Side and South Side slums, Mr. Taylor said. The risks were highest in the areas where public housing projects had been razed, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those hoping to cash in on the projected influx of condominium buyers are now stranded with no clear consumer base -- though there are some higher-income-earning professionals, the neighborhood's residents also include former public housing residents, students, and the elderly .</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shelby Thomas still saw potential in 2009 when he opened a day spa. He even viewed the quiet streets as a positive quality.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Thomas, who previously worked at upscale spas on Michigan Avenue, has yet to turn a profit since he began offering facials, massages, waxing and accupressure to clients who come mainly from the suburbs. To cut costs, in May he began living in the spa, which is in a spacious loft that was built in 2008, and he drew up a budget that did not include cooking gas or air conditioning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I unplug everything,'' Mr. Thomas said. ''I don't cook.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a neighborhood where the more affluent residents are accustomed to driving north to the Loop's shopping districts to buy luxury items, survival also depends on cross-promotion. Mr. Thomas encourages his clients to visit Faie's African Art Gallery next door, where paintings and sculptures can sell for several thousand dollars, or Fort Smith's Gift Shop, where the store's namesake sells his custom-made jewelry. Business owners say the sense of a shared project -- creating a retail district without the help of big-box chains or wealthy developers -- is what holds them together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The nonprofit Quad Communities Development Corporation, founded by Ms. Preckwinkle, offers incentives to attract small businesses to the neighborhood, including marketing and consulting, and helps them find real estate agents, grants and loans. The organization is also negotiating with commercial developers to create a 60,000-square-foot retail plaza on 47th Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project, which would include office and rental units, was postponed when the condominium market collapsed. One of the developers, the Skilken Corporation, secured financing earlier this year, and construction is slated to begin by the end of 2011, said Frank Petruziello, a principal with Skilken.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Chicago Housing Authority is planning a mixed-use housing project four blocks north of 47th Street on Cottage Grove Avenue on the former site of the Washington Park Homes, but ground-breaking is still years away and financing for the project is uncertain, said Matthew Aguilar, a spokesman for the housing authority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those development prospects, and the general spirit of community building, have not been enough to keep everyone in the Cottage Grove commercial district.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After spending three years on 44th Street and Cottage Grove, Cory Gilkey, the owner of the trendy clothing store Leaders, gave up. Worried about crime and disillusioned by the trash-strewn vacant lots, boarded-up buildings and other remnants of blight on his block, Mr. Gilkey moved in January 2009 to North Wells Street with its better foot traffic for ''peace of mind,'' he said. He also opened another store in Wicker Park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We got burglarized a few times, and the police said it was because we were an expensive store,'' Mr. Gilkey said. ''I have clients from England, Japan and Germany, and we would be concerned about their safety.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And all the visions for Bronzeville's comeback were not enough to keep him there, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We were promised there would be a total shopping metropolis,'' Mr. Gilkey said, ''but in my three years, I never saw anything done. We couldn't get inspired by anything down there.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DUBLIN -- Can one bank bring down a country?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Anglo Irish Bank</span>, the midsize Irish lender whose profligacy has come to symbolize the excesses of the real estate bubble here, is doing its best to find out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No other country aside from Iceland suffered a banking bust as severe as Ireland's during the financial crisis. Ireland was also the country that took the most direct route in tackling the problem, by recognizing upfront the bad loans of its devastated banks and transferring them to government ledgers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both the United States and Britain avoided such a move by taking stakes in their troubled banks and, in the case of Britain, insuring their worst-performing loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the Irish government's strategy is being called into question as its credit rating suffers and its borrowing costs resume their upward trajectory. Ireland's struggle to cope with its mounting bank losses could well be a harbinger for other parts of Europe and for the United States as stuttering economic growth and stagnant housing markets put further strain on bank balance sheets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anglo Irish, which on Tuesday reported a first-half loss of 8.2 billion euros ($10.4 billion) also said the government had injected an additional 8 billion euros ($10.16 billion) into the bank, bringing total aid so far to 22 billion euros.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike Aynsley, the bank's chief executive, said Tuesday that he expected the government's total investment in the bank to be about 25 billion euros ($31.75 billion). He added that commercial property, the bank's core lending market, which is already down 60 percent, had not yet reached bottom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Anytime you see a correction like that, you will see carnage,'' he said. ''But we think that the 25 billion euros will be largely sufficient.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts here expect the bank's defunct loans to hit 35 billion euros, or about 22 percent of Ireland's gross domestic product -- a hard-to-believe figure, given that Anglo Irish at its peak was just the third-largest bank in Ireland. In 2008, total Irish bank lending to households and nonfinancial companies was more than 200 percent of G.D.P. -- by far the highest such ratio in the euro zone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The growing losses at Anglo Irish and other Irish banks are expected to cost the government 80 billion to 90 billion euros, according to <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>, which says 35 billion euros will be needed for Anglo Irish -- a figure the government and Mr. Aynsley say is significantly overstated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ratings agency said that the country's banking liabilities would push its debt-to-G.D.P. ratio to 113 percent in 2012, higher than Spain's and Belgium's and approaching the levels of countries like Italy and Greece.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, S.&amp; P. downgraded Ireland's credit rating to AA-minus from AA, a change that has driven the already steep spread, or risk premium, on 10-year Irish government bonds to new highs of 5.5 percentage points -- second in the euro zone only to Greece's 11 percentage points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is out of control and the markets see it now,'' said Peter Mathews, an independent banking and real estate consultant here, who for the last year has been waging a furious one-man crusade, warning of Anglo Irish's escalating losses and calling for the bank to be liquidated -- with bond holders, not the Irish taxpayer, taking the hit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''How bad can it get?'' Mr. Mathews said. ''Irish debt paper could stop being tradable, and the outside agencies like the European Union and the International Monetary Fund might have to come in.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mathews's view in this regard represents an extreme. Economists at the Economic and Social Research Institute, an independent organization here, cite the government's cash cushion of about 40 billion euros -- much of it set aside at the outset of the crisis -- as a crucial safety net that separates Ireland from Greece.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government, for its part, argues that Ireland's approach to bad loans -- taking them off the balance sheets of the banks and then assuming responsibility for them -- was correct.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our banks would have probably assumed zombie-like status if we had delayed in recognizing these impairments,'' said John Corrigan, the chief executive of the country's debt management agency. Part of his organization is the National Asset Management Agency, the government group that has spent the year buying bad loans from banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The downgrade was deeply disappointing to us, but we still have a better credit rating than Italy and Portugal,'' he said. And international bond investors, who own about 85 percent of the government's debt, continued to buy its paper, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Will the Anglo Irish loans lead to a buyers' strike by investors?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''No,'' said Mr. Corrigan with a vigorous shake of his head. ''We have enough liquidity to take us well into the second quarter next year.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Mr. Mathews and the government may be opposed on how to handle the problem, they agree on how absurd the lending practices at Anglo Irish were.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even by the standards of the global banking collapse, Anglo Irish stood out. From a loan book of about 75 billion euros when the government took over in 2009, Anglo Irish says that it has only about 12 billion euros in loans that it classifies as performing. The bank is expected to transfer 36 billion euros in troubled loans to the asset management agency -- about half its existing loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was mad -- a credit cocaine run,'' said Mr. Mathews, his voice rising in frustration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was standing outside a gravel-strewn 25-acre plot, flanked by a housing project and the rough Dublin docklands. In 2006, as Ireland's real estate frenzy reached its peak, a group of developers paid 412 million euros ($523.2 million) for this industrial site, backed by a 300 million euro loan from Anglo Irish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mathews, a former banker who now advises real estate developers, estimates that the land may now be worth only 20 million euros -- if it can be sold at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is not just in Ireland that the bank's aggressive lending stood out. Through its private client division in Boston, Anglo Irish was one of the most wildly eager property lenders in the United States. It financed the construction of skyscrapers in Chicago and shopping centers in Boston, not to mention lending more than $500 million to a series of troubled and in some cases failed real estate projects in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most notorious of those was a top-of-the-market, $393 million mortgage in 2007 to the Apthorp, a luxury apartment building in New York that has been home to celebrities like the writer Nora Ephron and the actor Al Pacino.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a series of legal disputes, the building's developers are struggling to convert the complex into an upscale condominium. Anglo Irish recently said that rents on the units would be paid directly to the bank -- an indication, analysts say, that the project's developers may be facing further financing strains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was just the height of hubris,'' Mr. Mathews said as he drove away from the deserted development site in Dublin. ''And why should Citizen Joe and Mary pick up the tab for this when it was the bondholders that had all the aces in their hand?''</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Above Ground, a 2nd Ave. Subway Plan Attracts Critics</span>
</div><div class="author">By TERRY PRISTIN </div><div>1406 words</div><div>1 September 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Second Avenue subway, finally under construction on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, is of course a vast underground project. The $4.45 billion first phase, now scheduled to be completed in 2018, will extend from 96th Street to 63rd Street and Lexington Avenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the project will also include construction above ground -- not just station entrances but also a half-dozen boxy buildings on corners along Second Avenue that the transit agency acquired through condemnation. These so-called ancillary buildings, ranging in height from five to eight stories, will house ventilation equipment. They are also intended to disperse smoke and allow for evacuation from subway tunnels in the event of an emergency.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To the Metropolitan Transportation Authority of New York, the proposed buildings, designed by DMJM+Harris and Arup, part of the team that designed the Jet Blue Terminal at Kennedy International Airport, are ''handsome in proportion and detail, while simple and straightforward in design.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But to some real estate specialists, the structures represent a missed opportunity or an unwelcome industrial intrusion into a residential neighborhood, or both. Richard Bass, the chief planning and development specialist for Herrick, Feinstein, a law firm based in Midtown Manhattan, said that at three of the sites -- on 97th Street, 72nd Street and 69th Street -- the M.T.A. could have worked with private developers to incorporate the ancillary buildings into residential towers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bass represented a co-op on 69th Street in negotiations with the M.T.A. over the adjacent ancillary building. He is not involved in a lawsuit the co-op filed against the Federal Transit Administration and the M.T.A.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On each of the corners cited by Mr. Bass, the developers could have sought development rights, known as air rights, from smaller adjacent residential buildings, Mr. Bass said. He said taller apartment buildings would have been more in character with a residential neighborhood and would have helped fill a need for moderately priced housing. In addition, the M.T.A. could have had the developers share in the cost of the subway structures, Mr. Bass said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It seems that the M.T.A. missed an opportunity to play in the real estate game in a way that would have been a win-win-win,'' Mr. Bass said. ''This could have provided the M.T.A. with a more cost-effective facility, a more urbanistically appropriate structure for the surrounding community, and an opportunity to create more housing in partnership with developers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Citing the pending lawsuit filed by the 69th Street co-op, M.T.A. officials were unwilling to be interviewed. But they did agree to answer written questions by e-mail. They said they would not release cost estimates for the ancillary buildings until they had hired the contractors. Nor would they say how much they had paid for the building sites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kevin Ortiz, an M.T.A. spokesman, said by e-mail that the agency had worked with developers on both the 97th Street site, where the Century Lumber Corporation once stood, and on 72nd Street, the longtime home of Falk Drug and Surgical Supplies. Plans for 72nd Street, where the site measures 75 feet by 75 feet, were scuttled because ''in order for a development to work, additional property would have had to be acquired, which we couldn't justify as a transportation use,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On 97th Street, ''M.T.A. Real Estate worked very long and hard to make it work, but in the end the developer lost interest,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a subsequent e-mail, Aaron Donovan, another M.T.A. spokesman, said the developers that the agency had consulted owned the sites. Mr. Donovan said the agency had not issued requests for proposals from developers ''because we didn't own the properties,'' which were acquired through eminent domain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the M.T.A., only the 97th Street site, which measures 100 feet by 125 feet, is large enough to accommodate a residential development. The M.T.A. also would not say why it did not consult a second developer for that site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several developers, architects and engineers took issue with the M.T.A. and said the agency should have sought to work with private developers. ''It does sound like a missed opportunity,'' said Douglas Durst, who developed the <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> building at One Bryant Park. The 69th Street site, at 50 feet by 80 feet, ''is a little tight,'' he said, ''but the others are the perfect size for residential.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some real estate specialists said the transit agency could have found a model in an agreement struck in connection with the extension of the No. 7 subway line on the far West Side of Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a large site at 26th Street and 11th Avenue owned by the Moinian Group, the M.T.A. plans to build a seven-story ancillary structure for that line. The building was designed so Moinian Group could eventually build a residential tower that would incorporate the M.T.A. building, said Oskar Brecher, director of development for Moinian.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was a very complicated process that required a great deal of time,'' Mr. Brecher said. ''The midwife was the Hudson Yards Development Corporation,'' he added, referring to the city agency overseeing the development of the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Around the country, public officials have worked with the private sector to encourage development along new mass transit lines to increase ridership. Of course, no one thinks the Second Avenue subway will lack riders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But transit-oriented developments can also be used to defray construction costs. Julia Vitullo-Martin, director of the Center for Urban Innovation at the Regional Plan Association, said the M.T.A. typically had not engaged in strategic thinking when it came to its real estate. ''The M.T.A. does not think of its real estate as either an investment opportunity or a development opportunity,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Civitas, a civic group representing the Upper East Side and East Harlem, the critical issue is how the buildings, to be made of terra cotta tile, glass and granite, will affect street life along Second Avenue. The local community board has yet to take a formal position on the ancillary buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Certainly, the design of these structures could be improved,'' said Hunter Armstrong, the executive director. ''Having large blank industrial buildings inserted into a lively streetscape will diminish the activity and appeal of Second Avenue,'' he said. Civitas persuaded the M.T.A. to include retail spaces in two of the sites -- 360 square feet at 69th Street and 240 square feet at 72nd Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ortiz said the M.T.A. chose this style so that the public would recognize the buildings as industrial. He said the structures were not intended to be ''starchitecture'' but would be ''respectful of their immediate surroundings.'' The building materials ''need to be robust,'' he said, ''as they will receive only very minimal maintenance attention.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The M.T.A. did not always intend to make the buildings look industrial. In the final environmental impact statement, completed in 2004, it said they ''could be designed to appear like a neighborhood row house in height, scale, materials and colors.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The M.T.A.'s decision to build industrial rather than brownstonelike buildings was cited in a federal lawsuit filed in January against the Federal Transit Administration and the M.T.A. by a cooperative apartment building, 233 East 69th Street. Residents say that, as now conceived, the auxiliary building would be so close to their building that 32 windows facing east would be blocked. They also contend that the building ''would be totally out of harmony'' with the neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a conference on April 14, the M.T.A. argued that its building would blend in with the surroundings, but Judge William H. Pauley III of Federal District Court in Manhattan disagreed. ''You're asking me to suspend my common sense,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The M.T.A. had no comment on the lawsuit, which is still in its early stages.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DETROIT -- In sharp contrast to the rest of the Detroit metropolitan area, an area known as Midtown just north of the central business district has been holding its own in the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the success of Midtown -- as it was branded a decade ago -- is a result of the strength of institutions like Wayne State University, the <span class="companylink">Detroit Medical Center</span>, the <span class="companylink">Henry Ford Hospital</span> and the Detroit Institute of Arts, all of which contribute students and employees as well as residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another component of Midtown's success is that its developers are refurbishing older buildings, using tax credits and public financing, as much as they are building from scratch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For a long time, there was a big effort to tear things down in Detroit,'' said Michael Poris, a principal of the architecture firm McIntosh Poris Associates, which is restoring a former vaudeville house in Midtown for multiple uses. ''But if we have all these great historic buildings here, why not take the historic tax credits and reuse them? Plus it's a greener, more sustainable form of development.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the CoStar Group, a real estate information company in Bethesda, Md., the vacancy rate for office space in Midtown -- including an adjacent area called New Center, where the former headquarters of General Motors now houses state offices -- stood at 8.2 percent in the second quarter of this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The vacancy rate in Detroit's central business district, which at 24.5 million square feet has 3.5 times the space of Midtown, was 19.5 percent in the second quarter of 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a boon for Midtown, the <span class="companylink">Detroit Medical Center</span> announced in June that it had been acquired by <span class="companylink">Vanguard Health Systems</span>, a unit of the private equity giant <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group</span>, which said it would invest $850 million over five years to expand and upgrade the medical center's facilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We really have lost almost no businesses during the recession,'' said Susan Mosey, the president of the University Cultural Center Association, an organization formed by several Midtown institutions that guides development in the area. ''That isn't to say that businesses haven't had to reduce costs and become more efficient, but the neighborhood's remained pretty stable.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market is thriving too, Ms. Mosey said. Many obsolete buildings in Midtown have been converted to rental housing in recent years, and the rental market has been strong. An association study found that 92 percent of the 4,295 rental units in the area were occupied last spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A handful of condominium projects begun right before the national housing market collapsed had to shift gears and become rental apartments. Those were leased quickly, Ms. Mosey said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's one developer who converted his building to medical office, and he's fully leased,'' she said. ''There is a demand here for medical office use and uses related to the university.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project where Mr. Poris is restoring the former vaudeville house, the 1912 Garden Theater, includes a new three-story office building. The top two floors have been leased by the Wayne State Physicians Group, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That development, which is reviving an entire block along the area's main commercial artery, Woodward Avenue, includes construction of a 302-space parking garage and restoration of the two-story Blue Moon building, built in 1886, for office and restaurant space. After the Garden Theater is restored into a music hall and commercial space, 60 apartments will be built, Mr. Poris said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the $45 million development was financed with historic preservation tax credits, along with brownfield tax credits for re-using an obsolete building, Mr. Poris said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you can fund 40 percent of a project with tax credits, it's a big deal,'' Mr. Poris said. ''And the banks are looking for investments, so the banks will buy the tax credits, or investors will buy the tax credits. There's a market for them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another example, the long-vacant Argonaut building, the 760,000-square-foot Art Deco building that once housed vehicle design offices for General Motors, was restored in 2008 for $140 million, about half of which was financed by tax credits, said a co-developer, Eric B. Larson, the president and chief executive of Larson Realty Group. In September 2009, the College for Creative Studies, as well as an 880-student charter school, moved into the building, now called the A. Alfred Taubman Center for Design Education.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Preservationists had the foresight to get much of Midtown designated as historic in the 1990s, thus ensuring they would be eligible for tax credits, said Diane Van Buren, vice president of sustainable planning at Zachary &amp; Associates, a property development and development consulting group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zachary &amp; Associates, with several partners, is in the process of creating an area within Midtown called the Sugar Hill Arts District, in tribute to the traveling black jazz musicians who once played in clubs and stayed in stately homes in the neighborhood, Ms. Van Buren said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the district was destroyed in the urban renewal movement in the mid-20th century that displaced many African-American neighborhoods in Detroit and elsewhere, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several buildings and sites in Sugar Hill are being redeveloped, including 71 East Garfield Street -- the former site of a hotel that was destroyed by fire -- which has undergone a $6 million renovation into 22 live-work spaces for artists and eight commercial spaces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearby, a historic 19th-century nurses' home, Newberry Hall, is being redeveloped into 28 rental apartments. Both projects are stressing sustainability by using solar power, geothermal systems and recycled building materials, Ms. Van Buren said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite a lack of conventional financing from lending institutions for redevelopment, local developers have faith in the Midtown market and will soldier on, using tax credits, grants and public financing where possible, said Ernest Zachary, the president of Zachary &amp; Associates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have no question that if you build something here, people will move in,'' he said.</p>

</div><div class="author">By CHRISTINE HAUSER   </div><div>838 words</div><div>1 September 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>9</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer confidence improved slightly in August, according to the latest Conference Board survey, but Americans remained apprehensive about the economy and the job market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Conference Board said Tuesday that its index on consumer confidence rose in August to 53.5 points. It had declined to 51 in July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise in the index -- which examines how Americans feel about business conditions, the job market and the next six months -- was above forecasts of 50.5. A reading of at least 90 indicates a healthy economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All in all, consumers are about as confident today as they were a year ago,'' said Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board's consumer research center. ''Expectations about future business and labor market conditions have brightened somewhat, but over all, consumers remain apprehensive about the future.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer confidence is closely watched because consumer spending typically accounts for 70 percent of the American economy and is crucial to a sustained recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans expected a modest improvement in business conditions and were less pessimistic about job prospects, according to the survey. Those expecting more jobs in the months ahead rose to 14.6 percent, from 14.2 percent, the survey said, while consumers anticipating fewer jobs decreased to 19.4 percent, from 20.9 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chris G. Christopher Jr., senior principal economist for IHS Global Insight, said many respondents noted that jobs were hard to get in August.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Consumers are still very worried about the current state of the labor market, but improvement in confidence, albeit modest, is a small piece of good news given the steady stream of negative reports,'' Mr. Christopher said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People think six months from now things are going to get better,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another report on Tuesday, a crucial index on home prices in the United States rose in June, the last month a three-month moving average may have benefited from a tax credit for home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case-Shiller 20-city home price index, a widely watched indicator, on Tuesday reported a 1 percent rise in June from May, the third consecutive monthly increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nationally, the index rose 4.4 percent in the second quarter of 2010, after having fallen 2.8 percent in the first quarter. Home prices in the nationwide index are 3.6 percent above their year-earlier levels in the three-month period.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the outlook for the housing prices remains uncertain as excess supply, the flagging job market and other factors weigh on the sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said a federal housing credit distorted prices as home buyers took advantage of the credit. Though the tax incentive expired in April, data for June was still being influenced by earlier transactions that may have benefited from the credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That means the outlook for the rest of the year remains weak with the expiration of the tax credit, as well as the high level of foreclosures and inventories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''While the numbers are upbeat, other more recent data on home sales and mortgages point to fewer gains ahead,'' David M. Blitzer, chairman of the Index Committee at <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>, said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The worry starts when you remember that the home buyers' tax credit has expired, foreclosures are still at high levels, and July data on home sales and starts were very, very weak,'' he said. Yelena Shulyatyeva, a United States economist for <span class="companylink">BNP Paribas</span>, said that without employment growth, and in view of the excess housing supply, housing prices should remain under pressure throughout this year and next.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We do not take this report as a signal of future strength,'' Ms. Shulyatyeva said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patrick Newport, the United States economist for IHS Global Insight, said he expected home prices to decline next year, with the second-quarter index figures in 2011 to be another 8 to 10 percent lower from where they are now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The key reason is because there is still a big glut of homes,'' he said, with the second reason the number of foreclosures, followed by a job market that ''just isn't picking up,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The June numbers basically reflect a three-month moving average. Seasonally adjusted, home prices in June increased 0.71 percent in New York City and 0.02 percent in Los Angeles compared with the previous month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Case-Shiller report showed that 17 of the 20 metro areas surveyed registered an increase in June compared with May, according to nonseasonally adjusted data. Las Vegas fell 0.6 percent, with prices there close to their levels in 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices in Phoenix and Seattle remained flat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A report on pending home sales is scheduled to be released on Thursday.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE American economy is once again tilting toward danger. Despite an aggressive regimen of treatments from the conventional to the exotic -- more than $800 billion in federal spending, and trillions of dollars worth of credit from the Federal Reserve -- fears of a second recession are growing, along with worries that the country may face several more years of lean prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Fed, speaking in the measured tones of a man whose word choices can cause billions of dollars to move, acknowledged that the economy was weaker than hoped, while promising to consider new policies to invigorate it, should conditions worsen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet even as vital signs weaken -- plunging home sales, a bleak job market and, on Friday, confirmation that the quarterly rate of economic growth had slowed, to 1.6 percent -- a sense has taken hold that government policy makers cannot deliver meaningful intervention. That is because nearly any proposed curative could risk adding to the national debt -- a political nonstarter. The situation has left American fortunes pinned to an uncertain remedy: hoping that things somehow get better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It increasingly seems as if the policy makers attending like physicians to the American economy are peering into their medical kits and coming up empty, their arsenal of pharmaceuticals largely exhausted and the few that remain deemed too experimental or laden with risky side effects. The patient -- who started in critical care -- was showing signs of improvement in the convalescent ward earlier this year, but has since deteriorated. The doctors cannot agree on a diagnosis, let alone administer an antidote with confidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is where the Great Recession has taken the world's largest economy, to a Great Ambiguity over what lies ahead, and what can be done now. Economists debate the benefits of previous policy prescriptions, but in the political realm a rare consensus has emerged: The future is now so colored in red ink that running up the debt seems politically risky in the months before the Congressional elections, even in the name of creating jobs and generating economic growth. The result is that Democrats and Republicans have foresworn virtually any course that involves spending serious money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The growing impression of a weakening economy combined with a dearth of policy options has reinvigorated concerns that the United States risks sinking into the sort of economic stagnation that captured Japan during its so-called Lost Decade in the 1990s. Then, as now, trouble began when a speculative real estate frenzy ended, leaving banks awash in debts they preferred not to recognize and hoping that bad loans would turn good (or at least be forgotten). The crisis was deepened by indecisive policy, as the ruling party fruitlessly explored ways around a painful reckoning -- boosting exports, tinkering with accounting standards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are many ways in which you can see us almost surely being in a Japan-style malaise,'' said the Nobel-laureate economist Joseph Stiglitz, who has accused the Obama administration of underestimating the dangers weighing on the economy. ''It's just really hard to see what will bring us out.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Japan's years of pain were made worse by deflation -- falling prices -- an affliction that assailed the United States during the Great Depression and may be gathering force again. While falling prices can be good news for people in need of cars, housing and other wares, a sustained, broad drop discourages businesses from investing and hiring. Less work and lower wages translates into less spending power, which reinforces a predilection against hiring and investing -- a downward spiral.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deflation is both symptom and cause of an economy whose basic functioning has stalled. It reflects too many goods and services in the marketplace with not enough people able to buy them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For more than a decade, the global economy was fueled by monumental spending power underwritten by a pair of investment booms in America -- the Internet explosion in the 1990s, then the exuberance over real estate. As housing prices soared, homeowners borrowed against rising values, distributing their dollars to furniture dealers in suburban malls, and furniture factories in coastal China.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the collapse of American housing prices severed that artery of finance. Homeowners could not borrow, and they cut spending, shrinking sales for businesses and prompting layoffs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early this year, some economists declared that the cycle was finally righting itself. Businesses were restocking inventories, yielding modest job growth in factories. Hopes flowered that these new wages would be spent in ways that led to the hiring of more workers -- a virtuous cycle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the hopes failed to account for how extensively spending power had dropped in the American economy, and how uneasy people were made by every snippet of data showing that houses were not selling, employers were not hiring, and stock prices were foundering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, a new cause for concern is growing: the flat trajectory of prices, which might metastasize into a full-blown case of deflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The primary way to attack deflation is to inject credit into the economy, giving reluctant consumers the wherewithal to spend. The chief deflation fighter is the Federal Reserve, which traditionally adjusts a benchmark overnight rate for banks that influences rates on car loans, mortgages and other forms of credit. The Fed pulled this lever long ago, and has kept its target rate near zero since late 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fed has also been more creative. During the worst of the financial crisis, the Fed relieved American banks of troubled investments, many linked to mortgages, to give the banks room to make new loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This engendered the sort of debate likely to fill doctoral dissertations for generations. Most economists praise the Fed for confronting the possibility of another depression. But the Fed added to the nation's debts, provoking talk that it was testing global faith in the dollar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dramatic expansion of the national debt -- which began in the Bush administration, via hefty tax cuts and two wars -- has ratcheted up fears that, one day, creditors like China and Japan might demand sharply higher interest rates to finance American spending. Those rates would spread through the economy and inflict the reverse of deflation: inflation, or rising prices, as merchants lose faith in the sanctity of the dollar and demand more dollars in exchange for oil, electronics and other items.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, the reverse has happened. As investors lose faith in real estate and stocks, they are flooding into government savings bonds, keeping interest rates exceedingly low. Still, inflation worries occupy the people who control money, not least the governors of the Fed. The Fed has been seeking a graceful exit from its interventions, aiming to unload its cache of mortgage-linked investments and -- likely in the far future -- lift interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the recent disturbing economic news has delayed those plans. This month, the Fed said it would take the proceeds from its mortgage-linked investments and buy Treasury bills to keep longer-term interest rates down. The Wall Street Journal reported that this decision came amid substantial disagreement among the Fed's governors, suggesting that future action will be constrained by fears of inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Republicans in Congress have embraced further tax cuts and less spending as the answer to the weak economy, while accusing the administration of squandering stimulus spending on efforts that brought little gain. Some conservative analysts liken the government's reliance on spending and credit to imbibing another cocktail to take the edge off a hangover. In this view, the weak economy should be welcomed for the discipline it imposes, forcing a paring back of unsustainable spending, while building up savings that can finance investment and later feed healthy economic growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The recession is the cure for the disease that affects the economy, but the politicians don't have the stomach for it,'' says Peter Schiff, president of Euro Pacific Capital, a Connecticut-based brokerage house. ''They're going to keep stimulating the economy until they kill it with an overdose. The hyper-inflation that results is going to be far worse than the cure.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Germany, which has long harbored particularly powerful fears of inflation, has done relatively well in the current downturn without large stimulus spending, and that experience is now cited by adherents of austerity. But it can be argued that the Germans had two advantages over Americans: A more extensive social safety net to give consumers more money and the confidence to spend it, and a vibrant manufacturing base to churn out more goods for export.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most economists who are close to the policy making arena for both parties take the position that austerity is the wrong medicine for what ails the American economy, and they dismiss warnings about inflation as akin to focusing on the side effects of chemotherapy in the face of cancer. First, they argue, take the medicine and stave off the lethal threat; then deal with the collateral problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regardless, inflation fears persist, constraining what limited prescriptions might otherwise be thrown at a weakening economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The impending elections in November -- with control of Congress hanging in the balance -- has further narrowed the contours of political possibility</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Six months ago, Alan Blinder, a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, and now an economist at Princeton, dismissed the idea that America's political system would ever allow the country to sink into a Japan-style quagmire. ''Now I'm looking at the political system turning itself into a paralyzed beast,'' he says, adding that a lost decade now looms as ''a much bigger risk.'' Congress and the Obama administration have ruled out further stimulus spending. The Fed appears to be running out of powder. ''Its really powerful ammunition has been expended,'' Mr. Blinder says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even after the November election, few expect a different dynamic. ''We're already in a gridlock situation, and nothing substantive is going to change,'' says Bruce Bartlett, who was a Treasury economist in the first Bush administration. ''Clearly, a weak economy in 2012 will be very good for whoever the Republican presidential candidate is. It's hard to see how the Republicans lose by blocking stimulus.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, if deflation emerges as a verifiable menace, many economists expect Mr. Bernanke -- an expert on the Great Depression -- to again champion aggressive measures, perhaps expanding the Fed's balance sheet to buy pools of auto loans or credit card debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's very likely the Fed will bend in that direction if the economy stays soft, especially if they are starting to see deflation,'' says Kenneth S. Rogoff, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, and now a professor at Harvard. ''That's really starting to loom.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Friday, Mr. Bernanke, whose board can operate independent of politics and the government, offered assurance that he still had powerful therapies to use should conditions worsen. Yet he also expressed concern about the potential side effects, underscoring a reluctance for more action.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The issue at this stage is not whether we have the tools to help support economic activity and guard against disinflation,'' he said. ''We do.'' Then he added: ''The issue is instead whether, at any given juncture, the benefits of each tool, in terms of additional stimulus, outweigh the associated costs or risks of using the tool.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Right now, many homeowners owe the bank more than their homes are worth, prompting some to abandon properties, adding inventory to a market choked with vacant addresses. An Obama administration program aimed at slowing foreclosures has prolonged trouble, say some economists, by failing to relieve borrowers of unsustainable debt burdens or making transparent the extent of losses yet to be confronted by the financial system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The big question is, who's going to swallow the losses,'' says Mr. Stiglitz. ''It should be the banks, but they don't want to. We're likely to be in paralysis for years if they prevail.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Treasury sits in the middle, concerned by the continued weakness of housing, yet unwilling to pressure banks to write down mortgage balances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like their Japanese counterparts a decade ago, Treasury officials worry that forcing the banks to take losses could weaken them and risk another crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By default, muddling through has emerged as the prescription of the moment.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How bad is the housing market? Two Frank Lloyd Wright-designed texitle-block houses in Southern California have been languishing on the market -- one for two years, the other a year -- though the owners have slashed millions of dollars off the prices, Jori Finkel reports in The Los Angeles Times. What makes the houses especially rare is that Wright built only four such homes, using rows of patterned concrete blocks both as decoration and supporting walls. Both have maintenance issues, and, as the paper noted, ''they don't have high-end comforts for high-end buyers such as spa-style bathrooms or chefs kitchens.'' Still, the lack of interest puzzles preservationists. One owner is considering a deal to move one of the houses to Japan. Wright designed the houses with modularity in mind: they can be taken apart and reassembled, block by block.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's hard to read the headlines and not conclude that becoming a homeowner is a terrible idea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, the National Association of Realtorsannounced that existing-home sales in July had fallen an astounding 25.5 percent from the previous year. Sure, there was a federal tax credit in place last summer. But with single-family home sales at their lowest level since 1995 and unemployment still stubbornly high, home prices may fall further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, millions of homeowners are still far underwater, and government programs to help them have fallen well short of their goals. More foreclosures are coming, casting a deeper shadow over home prices. So it's hardly surprising that the conventional wisdom says that home values will never again rise faster than inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as with stocks and the weather, it is dangerous to assume any certainty in the housing market. And by wallowing too much in the misery of others, people looking for a new place to live run the risk of thinking every home purchase will end in regret, at least financially.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many still could, if they buy in hard-hit areas where prices could fall further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a mortgage is still a form of long-term forced savings, after all. This is more important than ever, since fewer people have access to generous pensions than they did during the last big housing slump. A 401(k) or similar plan is no bargain, either, with its erratic returns and employer matches that come and go as the economic winds shift. Social Security is also likely to be less generous, and Medicare will probably cost more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides, owning a home isn't just about what shows up on a net worth statement -- something that bears repeating after all the ''investing'' that people thought they were doing when buying homes over the last 10 or 15 years. Many of these more qualitative factors, from living free of a landlord's whim to having access to a good school district or retirement community, haven't changed and probably never will.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is possible, as a homeowner, to make very little money but still buy plenty of happiness. So before you swear off real estate, reconsider a few of the basics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WORST CASES Some buyers may rue the day in 2010 they bought their homes. They may end up like those who bought in 2006 and have lost their jobs. Now those people face the difficulty of moving to pursue employment elsewhere because they owe much more than their homes are worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marke Hallowell and Allison Firmat, who are getting married next month, are well aware of the history. Yet they plan to put 5 percent or less down, using a fixed-rate mortgage backed by the Federal Housing Administration, once they find a condominium in southern Orange County, Calif. (They've already been outbid a few times.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Firmat is not working, and Mr. Hallowell is a Web developer. Does he worry about mobility problems or making the payments in the event of a job loss, given that he's the sole breadwinner? ''We're getting such a good deal on interest rates that we could rent our place out,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hallowell and Ms. Firmat say they believe their approach is conservative, at least compared to what they might have done five years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Nothing is going to change the rate we will have,'' Mr. Hallowell said. ''Condos like the ones we're looking at now were unobtainable in the past, unless we went into something with a total balloon payment. There were times I was tempted, but never seriously.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, many people who are buying at the moment are locking in mortgage rates of about 4.5 percent. A year ago, they might have paid 5.25 percent on a $300,000 loan for a monthly payment of about $1,657. Today, you could lock in a lower monthly payment of around $1,520 on a mortgage that size, or you might not need to borrow that much, given that prices have fallen in many areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FORCED SAVINGS You may make nothing at all beyond inflation over time on a home, but the part of your mortgage payment that goes toward principal is a form of forced savings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sure, you might do better by renting and investing the difference between the rent and the total costs of ownership. But at least three things need to go right.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, you need to actually save the money. Americans have trouble with that sort of plan. Then, you need an after-tax return that's better than whatever a home would deliver. That's a task that might not have gone so well over the last 10 or 12 years, and it involves its own future risk, given how little safer investments are returning now. Finally, you must not raid the savings along the way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DIFFICULT LANDLORDS A bank can kick you out only if you don't pay your mortgage. But landlords can drive you away in any number of ways.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Laura Mapp and her husband, Carl Berg, rented from a relative, but it didn't go particularly well. They found another landlord they liked, but came back from a holiday trip one year to a note saying he wanted to move in himself. They had a month to scram. (The note came with a bottle of wine, at least.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In yet another rental, they let their landlord know they were looking to buy and inquired about a month-to-month lease. No problem, their landlord said, as long as they used his boyfriend as their real estate agent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year, the couple gave up on landlords and bought a house in the Highland Park neighborhood in Seattle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE NICE PART OF TOWN No matter how pretty the neighborhood, prices may still fall further in places like greater Detroit, Cleveland and Las Vegas; outlying areas of Los Angeles, San Francisco and Phoenix; and much of Florida. If you're looking elsewhere, consult The Times's rent-versus-buy calculator, halfway down the page at nytimes.com/yourmoney.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if you want to live in the Fox Hill Farm development in Glen Mills, Pa., you'll have to buy because renters are not allowed, said Bob Kuhn, who lives there. The same may be true of other communities for older people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And there may not be many family-size rentals -- or at least any financial edge to be gained by renting -- in suburbs or urban neighborhoods with excellent public schools.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After many years of building their down-payment fund and a couple of years of watching the listings in the Eagle Rock and Mount Washington areas of Los Angeles, Garret and Alison Williams realized that prices simply were not falling much there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the time they were ready to pounce this year, they had a big enough down payment and interest rates had fallen so far that renting didn't make much financial sense, even if they could have found a rental big enough for them and their two small children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Had we rented, we would be paying more than we're paying for a mortgage,'' said Ms. Williams, who had lived in the same two-bedroom rental for 12 years before she and her family moved into their new house in Eagle Rock earlier this month. ''I don't see how we could really regret having made the move when it's so much better for us on so many levels.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You have to wonder sometimes what they're smoking over there at the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Tuesday, the self-proclaimed ''voice for real estate'' released its ''existing home sales'' figures for July. They were gruesome. Sales were down 27 percent from the previous month, and down 26 percent from a year ago. Annualized, the July sales figures would translate into fewer than 3.9 million homes sold this year -- a staggeringly low figure. (The record high occurred in 2005, when more than seven million houses were sold.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The months-to-sale number was depressingly high; the Realtors group reported that it now takes more than a year to sell a typical house, compared with six months in a normal market. The amount of inventory is high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lest we forget, these awful numbers are coming out at a time when the financial incentive to buy could hardly be stronger: the fixed rate on a 30-year mortgage is at an incredibly low 4.36 percent, according to an authoritative survey conducted by <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet here was Lawrence Yun, the association's chief economist, trying to turn lemons into lemonade: ''Given the rock-bottom mortgage interest rates and historically high housing affordability conditions, the pace of a sales recovery could pick up quickly, provided the economy consistently adds jobs,'' he said in a news release.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Yun went on to attribute the weak July numbers to the expiration of the Obama administration's tax credit for home buyers. They had caused consumers to ''rationally'' jump into the market during the first half of the year -- at the expense of summer sales, he said. The post-tax-credit slump, he predicted, would be over by the fall, and by the end of the year, five million existing homes would be sold. (''To place in perspective, annual sales averaged 4.9 million in the past 20 years,'' he said.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Yun also predicted that home values would not fall much further, since they were ''back in line relative to income.'' In other words, the July numbers were a mere blip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clearly, Mr. Yun needs to get out a little more often. Specifically, he ought to talk to people on the ground -- like mortgage lenders or prospective borrowers. Talking to these people would probably give him a more sober take on the larger meaning of the latest sales numbers for existing homes. Sometimes, you see, lemons really can't be turned into lemonade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the financial markets, a lack of liquidity immediately leads to falling prices,'' said Lou Barnes, the founder of Boulder West Financial Services. (Boulder West was acquired last year by Premier Mortgage Group.) ''In the real estate market, something different happens,'' he added. ''Illiquid real estate markets freeze.'' That is what is happening now. For months, the Obama tax credit had been the only grease in the housing market. Now that it is gone, the buying and selling of houses is essentially grinding to a halt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why is this happening? Just as the subprime bubble of 2006 and 2007 required one kind of perfect storm -- namely, incentives to throw underwriting standards out the window -- we are now living through the opposite kind of perfect storm. Essentially, every participant in the housing market has a reason to be afraid. And that fear is paralyzing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prospective buyer, for instance, has two good rationales to fear buying a new home. One is the unemployment rate. ''A major psychological thing happens with high unemployment,'' says Dave Zitting, a veteran mortgage banker and founder of Primary Residential Mortgages. ''Those with a job worry about whether they are going to keep that job'' -- which, in turn, prevents them from taking the plunge on a new home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second reason is that, Mr. Yun notwithstanding, most people simply do not believe that housing prices are even close to hitting bottom. ''In the Bay Area, a house that was worth $300,000 a decade ago became a million-dollar home,'' said Greg Fielding, a real estate broker and blogger. ''Now it is listed at $800,000.'' That price, he suggested, was still unrealistically high. The seller, meanwhile, doesn't want to face the fact that his or her home is too richly priced, and won't sell at a more realistic price -- which may well be below his or her mortgage debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is also an immense amount of inventory that has yet to hit the market but will, sooner or later. People in the real estate business have taken to calling this ''the shadow inventory.'' It consists of homes for which the owners have stopped paying the mortgage but the banks haven't foreclosed on yet, foreclosed properties that have not yet been put up for sale, homes with modified mortgages that the owners still can't afford and will soon default on and so on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Barnes describes the shadow inventory as akin to ''ranks of Napoleonic infantry, rows deep, hidden in the fog.'' This inventory, estimated by Rick Sharga of RealtyTrac to be between three million and four million homes, is almost certain to drag down home prices for the foreseeable future. ''The disinterest of buyers, in an interest-rate environment that may be the lowest ever, is striking,'' Mr. Barnes said. But, he added, it makes perfect sense. Since 2007, housing prices have been in a deflationary spiral, and nobody can say when it will end. ''It doesn't matter if interest rates go down to 2 percent,'' Mr. Barnes said -- buyers won't reappear in big numbers until they can see the light at the end of the tunnel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So that is what it looks like for the prospective borrower. Now look at it from the lender's perspective. Chastened by the excesses of the bubble, mortgage lenders have swung hard in the other direction, becoming excessively, almost insanely, conservative. They demand high FICO scores. They won't lend to anyone who is recently self-employed -- even if the potential borrower has socked away a lot of money in the bank, or is making a good income. They won't count income from capital gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have wonderful people in my office every day who would have qualified for a loan prior to the bubble'' but now can't get one, Mr. Zitting said. Mr. Barnes said: ''Underwriting standards are vastly tighter than any time in my lifetime. It is choking off buyers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's the strangest part, though: it is really not the lenders themselves who are imposing the most draconian of these tight new underwriting standards. Rather, it is the federal government. That's right, the government.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time that the administration was offering a hefty tax credit to spur home sales, the government's wholly owned subsidiaries, <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, were imposing rules that made it increasingly difficult to buy a home. And Fannie and Freddie have the ultimate say these days because without their guarantee, Wall Street securitizers won't buy a mortgage from a bank -- because Wall Street is just as fearful as every other participant in the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The government right now is insuring something like 85 to 90 percent of the country's mortgages,'' said Daniel Alpert, a managing director of Westwood Capital. And given the enormous losses Fannie and Freddie were saddled with during the financial crisis, they are in no mood to take risks, not even on borrowers who are normally considered creditworthy. So they are saying no a lot more than they used to -- even though this is having a terrible effect on the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's even become nearly impossible for well-heeled investors to buy rental properties. This is no small matter. At the peak of the bubble, the rate of homeownership approached 70 percent. Now it is falling toward 65 percent -- which is more or less where it was before all the housing madness of the last decade. That means that millions of Americans who were briefly homeowners need to become renters again. They need a place to rent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But somebody has to buy the homes they are leaving behind and turn them into rental properties. The most likely buyer is a professional investor who purchases rental properties for a living. Yet, absurdly, government rules have made it exceedingly difficult to make loans to investors who want to buy up rental properties. This only adds to the shadow inventory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few weeks ago, some of the better known financial bloggers had a background briefing at the Treasury Department with officials who included Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner. In their blog posts after the meeting, they did not, alas, describe a government strategy that called for loosening Fannie's and Freddie's overly cautious standards -- the obvious short-term solution. Instead they described a Treasury housing strategy that was essentially a play for time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax credit for home buyers; the willingness to look the other way as banks refused to foreclose, pretending that the owners still planned to pay their mortgage; the half-baked government mortgage modification programs -- they were all aimed at buying time until the economy recovered and employment picked up. At which point, they hoped, the housing market would have achieved enough lift that it could take off on its own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of June, though, the tax credit disappeared -- and that's when time ran out. On Friday, the new G.D.P. numbers came out, confirming what everybody already knew. The economy has not recovered -- not even close. If the housing market is like an airplane on a runway, it is far more likely to crash at this point than it is to take off. That is why the July numbers are so scary to those in the housing business.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the ground, they don't look like a blip. They look like a very painful future.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">U.S. Economy Slowed to 1.6% Pace in 2nd Quarter</span>
</div><div class="author">By MOTOKO RICH </div><div>1112 words</div><div>28 August 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>The New York Times on the Web</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economic statistics released Friday offered the clearest sign yet that the recovery, already acknowledged to be sauntering, had slowed to a crawl.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government lowered its estimate of economic growth in the second quarter to an annual rate of 1.6 percent, after originally reporting last month that growth in the April-June period was 2.4 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The revision is a significant slowdown from the annual rate of 3.7 percent in the first quarter and 5 percent in the last three months of 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The news came at the end of a week that showed the economic retrenchment that began in the second quarter has spilled over into the summer. Existing home sales in July were down to their lowest level in a decade, and sales of new homes last month were at their lowest level since the government began tracking such data in 1963. Orders for large factory goods, excluding the volatile transportation sector, dropped in July, indicating that recovery in the manufacturing sector also was stalling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With such grim reports, economists are now concerned that the outlook for job creation, which has been spluttering all summer, could deteriorate further. Companies and consumers tend to be spooked by bad news, and market analysts and economists worry that faltering confidence could cause employers to hold back on hiring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When you get a downshift in growth there is a risk that it will feed on itself,'' the chief economist at <span class="companylink">MF Global</span>, James F. O'Sullivan, said. ''The question now is to what extent has the improving trend just been temporarily set back or has it really been short-circuited.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a speech Friday morning, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben S. Bernanke, said that he expected the economy to continue on a growth track, ''albeit at a relatively modest pace.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also indicated that the Fed would be willing to resume large purchases of longer-term debt if the economy worsened. Such moves could have the effect of lowering mortgage rates. Although rates are already at historic lows, economists suggest that lower rates could eventually spur some home-buying or at least refinancing, which gives households more cash to spend.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, a closely watched survey by the University of Michigan and Thomson Reuters showed that consumer sentiment ticked up marginally in August from July, but remained well below levels seen during the previous six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bulk of the downgrade in the second-quarter G.D.P. was because government analysts had assumed that American companies added more inventory to their warehouse shelves than they actually did. The adjustment also took into account a sharp rise in imports, leading to a wider-than-estimated trade deficit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists polled by Bloomberg News had been expecting the second-quarter growth figure to be revised down to 1.4 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inventories, originally reported to have grown by $75.7 billion, actually grew by $63.2 billion. Some economists pointed to a silver lining in the figure. Because companies have kept inventories relatively low, ''if demand was to take off, they would have to hire additional workers and ramp up production,'' said Omair Sharif, United States economist at the <span class="companylink">Royal Bank of Scotland</span>. ''So the fact that businesses did not accumulate enough inventories sets the stage for a much stronger pickup in employment and hours worked in the future, if demand picks up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, companies are not building up inventories. ''There is some hesitancy out there now about building up any more than they have to,'' said Thomas J. Duesterberg, chief executive of the Manufacturers Alliance-MAPI, a trade association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Imports, which were first reported to have grown at an annual rate of 28.8 percent, the biggest jump in a quarter-century, grew by 32.4 percent, compared with a much lower gain of 9.1 percent in exports. Mr. Duesterberg said he expected exports to grow further in the second half of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What strength there had been in the original growth number came from business investment in items that included office buildings, equipment and software. The revised number showed that such spending rose at an annual rate of 17.6 percent, not much different from the 17 percent estimated in the initial second-quarter report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer spending, which economists often look to as a primary indicator of recovery, grew 2 percent. That was a slightly better rate than the Commerce Department originally said last month when it reported that consumption grew at an annual rate of 1.6 percent in the second quarter, and just above the 1.9 percent increase in the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Optimists pointed to that bump in consumer spending as a sign that the recovery, while weak, still had legs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group, said that he expected the Fed to take action and for companies, now sitting on large cash reserves, to eventually start hiring again, moves that he believed would translate into more robust consumer spending.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But more bearish analysts said there was little evidence that the economy was recovering in anything but name only. With more recent indicators showing a shrinking housing market, dwindling orders for factory goods and rampant discounting among retailers, some economists saw far more clouds than sun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Given all the stimulus and all the steroids and all the medication, the economy should be ripping right now,'' said David Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist for Gluskin Sheff &amp;Associates. ''The fact that it's not should lead people to believe that this is certainly not a common recession.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rosenberg pointed out that during the Great Depression, the economy experienced several quarters of official growth, despite the presence of bread lines and rampant unemployment. Now, he said, ''it seems the diagnosis is pretty clear, but people don't like to talk about it, because Depression depresses people.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists have been revising their forecasts for growth in the second half, with <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> now projecting annual growth of 1.5 percent. Ben Herzon, a senior economist at <span class="companylink">Macroeconomic Advisers</span>, a forecasting group, said the firm had taken its estimate for third-quarter growth down to 1.7 percent from 2.5 percent at the beginning of July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Herzon said that he was not expecting a double-dip back into recession, however. ''It's difficult to point to a shock that would be bad enough to put the economy back into a recession,'' he said. ''I just think it means that this recovery is going to be slower and more painful than we originally expected.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sharif el-Gamal is a relative newcomer to the New York City real estate business. He got his broker's license in 2002. He is developing two condominium projects: turning a building in TriBeCa into six lofts, and planning apartments on what is now a West Side parking lot. He comes from the well-off family of a bank executive, but not from real estate billions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With a career marked by drive and ambition but still in its early stages, Mr. Gamal, 37, has taken on a colossal challenge. He is the developer planning a Muslim community center on property he owns near ground zero -- a $100 million project, he estimates, at the center of the most contentious national debate over Islam, America and freedom of religion in the nine years since 9/11.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is the kind of project -- a 15-story building, open to all, with a theater, educational programs, a swimming pool, a restaurant, a mosque and a 9/11 memorial -- that people with experience in Manhattan development say needs years of groundwork, even without controversy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But although he has cleared the legal hurdles and won approval from the local community board, Mr. Gamal has yet to secure financing, hire an architect, incorporate the nonprofit entity that will run the center, start its fund-raising, recruit its board members, or present formal feasibility studies and business plans to community meetings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Putting aside sweeping debates over the project's propriety and meaning, many ask a simpler question: Can Mr. Gamal pull it off?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have always marveled at the romantic notion that the average New Yorker has toward development,'' said Josh Guberman, who in developing 28 properties in the city has dealt with financing, plumbing, transportation, unions and more. ''To be frank, successful development in New York City is not an arena for the novice or inexperienced player.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building anything anywhere in recession-era New York is tough; Lower Manhattan is tougher; Mr. Gamal's project, called Park51, is still more complex.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gamal hopes to raise $70 million through tax-exempt bonds, which religiously affiliated nonprofit groups can obtain -- but only if they prove that the facilities will benefit the general public, with religious functions separately financed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He wants to recruit a board of business and civic leaders -- Christians, Jews and Muslims -- to raise an additional $30 million to $40 million for the nonprofit's stake in the building. Russell Simmons, the hip-hop mogul, has signed on. But controversy complicates recruiting, and donations will be squeezed by the economy and scrutinized by opponents who wonder if money will come from radical Islamist groups or hostile governments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gamal has told supporters that he will take no money linked to ''un-American'' values and that donations will be vetted by federal and state authorities and separate boards for the center and the mosque.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comparable projects like the Jewish Community Center of Manhattan, on the Upper West Side -- Mr. Gamal is a member; his daughters learned to swim there -- have planned their programming before financing the construction, to show they will have revenue from, say, gym memberships or day care. But Mr. Gamal's plans are just beginning, and must focus enough on Muslim needs to attract national Muslim support while stressing multifaith outreach to win other donors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The downtown market is especially tricky, said Julie Menin, chairwoman of the local community board, with commuters during the day and residents at night. Then, too, some New York Muslims feel that $100 million would be better spent on facilities in more heavily Muslim neighborhoods, Aisha al-Adawiya, of the Harlem group Women in Islam, said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Debby Hirshman, who was the founding executive director of the J.C.C. and is a consultant on a community center to open next year in Battery Park City, said those projects spent 5 to 10 years on community meetings. Ms. Hirshman added, however, that organizations ''start in all different ways.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gamal, a stocky man with a faint New York accent and the brash speech of a fraternity brother or a bond trader, says he can do it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are very confident that we will be able to arrange the right mix of borrowing and private investment,'' he said in a statement, noting that he has the support of city officials and others involved in downtown redevelopment. ''Several financial institutions have expressed interest'' in financing the project, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent days, Mr. Gamal has reasserted control over the project's image, stressing that he, not the imam Feisal Abdul Rauf, is in charge, and hiring a new public relations adviser, Lawrence Kopp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That places new focus on Mr. Gamal. His father, an Egyptian, was a managing director at Chemical Bank. His parents divorced; he lived in Brooklyn until age 9, when his mother, a Polish Catholic, died. He then followed his father to Liberia and to Egypt, where he attended the Schutz American School.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gamal returned to the United States for college, studying architecture and economics before dropping out. He was not raised in a religious household, but Islam helped Mr. Gamal out of a troubled youth, Mr. Kopp said. A younger brother, Sammy, is a partner in his company, SoHo Properties; a sister is a Lebanon analyst for the Pentagon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a stint waiting tables, Mr. Gamal entered the close-knit New York real estate world, where he is better known as a broker than as a developer. He began buying buildings three years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gamal has traveled to the Middle East, as have many New York developers. Gulf oil money is one of their few financing sources in the current market. But Mr. Gamal says his only current investors are from the United States and Israel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a broker, Mr. Gamal reliably delivers deals, said Michael Betancourt, an investor whom Mr. Gamal helped buy and rent out two SoHo buildings. ''The kid keeps his head down, and he's a grinder,'' Mr. Betancourt said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As an owner and developer, though, he is just getting started, by New York standards. Public filings show Mr. Gamal bought, starting in 2007, a half-dozen apartment buildings in Harlem and Washington Heights for $1.075 million to $2.8 million. Two have outstanding building violations and owe the city money. He also manages properties in Chelsea and Harlem. He bought his first major office building, 31 West 27th Street, in 2009, for $45.7 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers said Mr. Gamal bid on other properties without success. One real estate executive involved in a purchase with Mr. Gamal said he took weeks to get financial documents that buyers typically assemble within hours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Daniel Parker, who interned on commission at SoHo Properties in 2006, left for a firm that offered a steadier paycheck. But he was impressed with Mr. Gamal's religious tolerance. Mr. Parker, who is Mormon, said the two talked about their religions and abstinence from drinking. He admired how Mr. Gamal and his brother left work to pray every Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gamal attended two Lower Manhattan mosques that were overflowing, and decided to build a mosque and community center, a Muslim version of the J.C.C. In July 2009, Mr. Gamal paid $4.85 million, a bargain price, for the property on Park Place, two blocks from ground zero.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You could tell,'' Mr. Parker said, ''he was going to figure out a way to do something big.''</p>

</div><div class="author">By TARA SIEGEL BERNARD   </div><div>1591 words</div><div>26 August 2010</div><div>NYT Blogs</div><div>NYTB</div><div>English</div><div>© 2010 The New York Times Company. All rights reserved   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let's assume that you'll live to a ripe old age and die peacefully in your sleep.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or not. And if not, isn't it time to think about getting your will done? It's one of those tasks that many people tend to put off, for obvious reasons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But at least one responsible parent is on the case: A single mom recently wrote to me and asked how she can ensure that her teenage daughter would inherit her assets without a problem, should something happen to her. She had several questions: Is a revocable trust better than a will? Should I revise my will? What happens if I remarry?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All good questions. So I thought I would answer some of them here, along with some other common queries that tend to arise when writing a will:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">1. When Do I Need a Will?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It clearly becomes more important after you have children, since a will allows you to name a guardian. But anyone who has accumulated some money or other assets should have a basic will. If you don't, everything will be divvied up according to the law of the land where you live, and in some states, that may mean your young children will end up with more assets than your spouse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2. Can I Do It Myself?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether you should rely on software or use an attorney depends on your personal circumstances and comfort level. But if you're at all unsure, it's probably worth paying for a professional opinion. This isn't something you want to get wrong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, there are a variety of solid will-writing software packages that will give you step-by-step instructions. Mary Randolph, author of estate-planning related books and vice president for editorial at Nolo, which publishes do-it-yourself books and software for legal matters, said she believes there are plenty of people who could benefit from a simple will using a trustworthy program. "You won't get in trouble with a simple, straightforward will as a starting point," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ask an attorney, however, and you get another answer. &nbsp;Alan F. Rothschild, Jr., an estate planning attorney in Columbus, Ga., admits that it may seem self-serving, but said that preparing a will on your own can be fraught with risks and unforeseeable problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the biggest mistake people make, he says, is thinking that the end product is the will itself. "This would be akin to saying the prescription is what you pay for when you go to see a doctor," said Mr. Rothschild, who is also chairman of the American Bar Association's real property, trust and estate law section. &nbsp;"Of course, it's not the piece of paper -- either the prescription or basic will -- that is the product, it is the professional's advice and experience."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clearly, people who are concerned about the estate tax, or those with complex financial or family lives, should see an attorney. Currently, there is no federal estate tax. If Congress fails to act by the end of the year, estates valued at more than $1 million would be subject to the tax starting in 2011. But many experts believe lawmakers will ultimately settle on an exemption closer to $3.5 million. Many states also impose their own estate taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others who should seek a professional help: Small business owners, parents of children with special needs, or couples where one partner is facing an illness like Alzheimer's or who may have early signs of dementia. In that last instance, you need to think about who will care for your partner and how and&nbsp; consider when or if they might end up on Medicaid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or maybe you're remarried but still want to leave most of your assets to your children. This may also call for a lawyer's assistance, since "disinheriting" a spouse can get tricky.&nbsp; (You may need a prenuptial or postnuptial agreement, Ms. Randolph says.) The same goes for people who want to make more complex plans, or who fear their wishes will be contested.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for people who aren't fabulously wealthy or who have straightforward plans, will-writing may be easily accomplished with a good program on the Web. Some of the more widely-referenced products include Quicken WillMaker, which can be downloaded for about $42, and LegalZoom.com, where pricing starts at $69.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whichever program you decide to use, and there are many, make sure it provides thorough step-by-step instructions and accounts for the differences in state laws, said Ms. Randolph, who helped create the Quicken and Nolo programs. And be sure to carefully follow the instructions about how exactly the official will-signing ceremony must play out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Mr. Rothschild noted, do-it-yourself wills can be completely invalidated due to simple mistakes. Beneficiaries, for instance, can't also serve as witnesses. And some states have very strict rules that require the witnesses to not only be in the room but also watch the will owner sign. Mr. Rothschild has also seen a variety of other errors and oversights, such as failure to name an "alternate" executor of the will.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">3. Do I Need More Than Just a Will?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Legal experts also recommend putting other documents in place that &nbsp;allow others to make decisions for you in the event you become incapacitated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it comes to medical matters, an advance directive or living will describes what kind of treatment you want (or do not want) at the end of your life. "Everyone of every age ought to have a medical power of attorney or advance directive," said Ms. Randolph. "Advance directives makes your wishes known, and a medical power of attorney allows someone to carry those wishes out."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A financial power of attorney, meanwhile, gives someone legal authorization to handle your financial affairs when you can't do so on your own. All of these directives can be handled by an attorney or with software.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">4. What about a Revocable Trust?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the big reasons people set up revocable trusts, also known as living trusts, is to avoid probate, the court-supervised process to settle a deceased person's estate. Why? Depending on where you live, probate can be a costly and lengthy process. Attorney, court and other fees often cost up to 5 percent of the value of the estate, Ms. Randolph said. Many Californians choose to use revocable trusts for that reason, she said. Be sure to check the probate laws in your state.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's how the revocable trust works: you put all of your assets into the trust, which remains in your control and can be changed at any time. For the trust to work, you need to re-title all of your assets to the trust &nbsp;( a "pour over" will is also typically used to transfer, or "pour over," any assets that weren't in the trust at the time of &nbsp;your death). After you die, a trustee that you name distributes the assets according to your instructions, all while avoiding probate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some legal experts say that revocable trusts are more difficult to contest than a will, and they also allow you to keep your affairs private (Wills become part of the public record during probate).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">5. How Else Can I Avoid Probate?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can set up a revocable trust, but it may be an unnecessary expense for many people. Many of your assets will avoid probate anyway, as long as you've named a beneficiary. This is easily done on &nbsp;retirement accounts like 401(k)s, &nbsp;I.R.A.'s or insurance policies. So keep those designations &nbsp;up to date (and include alternate beneficiaries, where you can).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other types of property may require some additional paperwork. If you hold any joint bank accounts, they typically have "rights of survivorship," which means the assets in the account will automatically become the property of &nbsp;the account co-owner upon your death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You can also add a "payable on death" provision to most bank accounts. (If you have a joint account, this means the beneficiary will inherit the account after the second owner dies.) Just ask your bank about how to add this provision, since it's free and usually just requires you to fill out a form, says Ms. Randolph. The only downside, she said, is that you can't name alternate beneficiaries.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similar arrangements can usually be made for certificates of deposit, brokerage accounts, and stocks and bonds. And thirteen states now allow you to set up "transfer on death" deeds for real estate holdings, she added. Transfer-on-death designations can also be registered for cars and other vehicles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">6. Where Should I Keep My Will?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, make sure the executor of your estate knows where your will &nbsp;and other important documents are stored. Experts recommend keeping them in a fire-proof box in your home, not a safety deposit box. That way, they're a bit more accessible to an executor.</p>

</div><div class="author">By DAVID STREITFELD </div><div>1222 words</div><div>25 August 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Americans' long infatuation with owning a home, which even the economic collapse of 2008 could not kill, shuddered and stalled last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing sales in July plunged 25.5 percent below the level of a year ago, the National Association of Realtors said on Tuesday, as buyers lost the spur of a government tax credit. The steep descent surprised nearly every analyst and put the volume of single-family home sales at the lowest level since 1995.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The financial markets took the news badly, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing down 134 points to a six-month low. As investors sought security, the yield on the two-year Treasury note fell to a record low.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage rates are the lowest in modern memory while affordability, because of price declines of 30 percent in many areas, is the highest in at least a decade. The government is allowing buyers to put only a token amount down, guarantees lenders against default and regularly issues proclamations that the worst is over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apparently, all of that is not enough to put a floor under housing. With unemployment steady for month upon month at more than 9 percent, and with millions heavily in debt or simply skittish, many potential buyers are lost to the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No region was immune in July, with sales in the Northeast dropping 30 percent, the Midwest falling by a third, the South down 20 percent and the West off 23 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report ''shows that there's a lot more work yet to do,'' the White House deputy press secretary, Bill Burton, said at a briefing on Martha's Vineyard, where President Obama is vacationing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate helped drive this recession, and no one expects it to be a help in getting out. Instead, the urgent question is how much it will drag down other parts of the fragile recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The turmoil in housing, which is likely to lead to further price declines this winter, could send growth in the second half of the year below 1 percent, said Joel L. Naroff, an economist. ''It won't be a double-dip recession but it might feel like it,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts had been expecting a drop in July home sales because the month was the first time in a year that buyers were ineligible for the government housing tax credit. But the consensus expectation was for a decline of about 13 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $8,000 tax credit increased sales and stabilized prices last year, which led Congress to expand and extend the incentive through this spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cost was about $30 billion. Economists said that just as the credit had artificially buoyed the market, the end of the credit was artificially depressing it. ''If you pay them, they will come. But when ya stop paying them, they leave in droves,'' the economist Tom Lawler wrote in an e-mail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His conclusion: ''People shouldn't panic.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those on the front lines of real estate describe an unusual standoff between buyers, who can afford to be fickle as rarely before, and sellers, who feel they cannot go lower. For many sellers, agents say, another 5 percent would mean taking a loss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What few buyers are out there circle a listing like a vulture, waiting from the day of its debut until it's left for dead,'' said Glenn Kelman, chief executive of the online brokerage Redfin. Then, he said, they might make a low-ball bid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kelman said that what made the sales drop ''even more breathtaking'' was that it was happening in July, which is typically when demand peaks. Sales were down 27.2 percent from the rate in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the last 20 years, sales of existing homes have averaged about 4.9 million a year. The sales volume in July equates to an annual rate of 3.83 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Truly gut-wrenching,'' said Jennifer H. Lee, senior economist for BMO Capital Markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lawler, whose forecast for July was much more accurate than his colleagues' estimates, said housing would truly be healthy only when there was enough employment growth to spur the creation of new households. For instance, adult children who are living at home will have to get places of their own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few think that will be happening any time soon. In the meantime, there will be too many homes on the market, which tends to push down prices as sellers compete.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A normal market has an inventory level of less than six months. While relatively few new sellers put their homes on the market in July, the drop in sales was sufficient to push inventory levels up to 12.5 months. That exceeds any level since records were first collected in 1999.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices have been stable for much of the last year, a trend largely due to the tax credit. The Realtors' group said Tuesday that the median existing-home price for all housing types was $182,600 in July, up 0.7 percent from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most housing experts think prices will fall another 5 to 10 percent this winter. That makes this a miserable time for those who want to sell, not to mention those who do not want to be reminded that the walls sheltering them are worth a tiny bit less each day. But it is quite a hopeful moment for buyers who have waited patiently through the bust and have a bit of nerve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jimmy and Lisa Penz looked for a condo in Chicago when they got married in 2007 but could not make the finances work. Last year, when Lisa was pregnant, they looked again to no avail. Using their emergency cash for a down payment would have been wrong, they thought.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Time was on their side. Next month, the couple and baby Jackson will move into a home in the suburb of Arlington Heights for which they paid a little less than $400,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Because we waited, we were able to afford a fourth bedroom,'' said Mr. Penz, a consultant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His house, he knows, is ''an illiquid asset, a long-term asset, something I won't be able to tap in for cash. But we chose a place we'll be able to stay for a long time, to ride out any trouble.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once upon a time, before everyone from the banks to the buyers to the sellers got greedy, that was how everyone thought about the housing market. And however bumpy the path, that is once again the market's future, said Mr. Kelman of Redfin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not the apocalypse,'' he said. ''People will buy homes when they need to move or want the house, not when they want to make money. There will be winners and losers -- not just, as in years past, winners and bigger winners.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing sales in July plunged to their lowest level in more than a decade, exceeding even the grimmest forecasts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said Tuesday that the seasonally adjusted annual sales rate of 3.83 million was 25.5 percent below the level of July a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">July was the first month that buyers could not qualify for a tax credit of up to $8,000, so analysts were expecting weak results. But their consensus called for a decline of about 13 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jennifer H. Lee, senior economist for BMO Capital Markets, called the numbers ''truly gut-wrenching.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those on the front lines of real estate describe an absolute standoff between buyers and sellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What few buyers are out there circle a listing like a vulture, waiting from the day of its debut until it's left for dead, contacting us only after it has left the market to ask what it sold for and whether it's taking backup offers,'' said Glenn Kelman, chief executive of the online brokerage Redfin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kelman noted that what made the sales drop ''even more breathtaking'' was that it was happening in July, a month when demand typically peaks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Prices will have to drop again in most markets before buyers come back in force,'' Mr. Kelman said, ''and so sales volume will probably be in the tank at least until next spring.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing prices have been relatively stable for most of the last 12 months. But even before the July drop in sales, analysts were expecting prices to fall another 5 or 10 percent this winter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">July sales were down 27.2 percent from June. It was the lowest rate for existing-home sales, which include houses, condos, co-ops and town houses, since 1999. For sales of single-family homes, it was the lowest rate since 1995.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The number of homes on the market increased only slightly but the large drop in sales was enough to push inventory levels up to 12.5 months. A normal market has an inventory level of less than six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher inventories tend to cause prices to decline, as many sellers compete to take advantage of fewer buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drop in sales came despite the lowest mortgage rates in decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Realtor group was optimistic the fall-off would be temporary, as long as the economy improves -- a rather big ''if.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Given the rock-bottom mortgage interest rates and historically high housing affordability conditions, the pace of a sales recovery could pick up quickly, provided the economy consistently adds jobs,'' the group's chief economist, Lawrence Yun, said in a statement.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The day'' was when Mr. Feinberg officially took control as administrator of the $20 billion fund set up by BP to pay out claims to those whose lives or businesses have been hurt by the BP oil spill. For the occasion, he traveled along the Mississippi coast, laying out his plans, answering questions and encouraging people to file claims immediately.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Details of his plan have been made public over the past few days, but there was no shortage of questions from the skeptical crowd at the bingo hall, a mix of shrimpers, lawyers, real estate developers, restaurateurs and politicians, in flip-flops, flats and oxford shoes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Keath Ladner, owner of Gulf Shores Sea Products, said he had been communicating with scientists around the country and had serious concerns that the August 2013 deadline for final settlement claims might fall before the true extent of the damage was known. Even if the shrimp, crab and oysters are found to be safe, it is impossible to say how long seafood buyers will be suspicious of gulf seafood. For now, Mr. Ladner said, they certainly are not buying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is one of the most difficult questions we've got,'' Mr. Feinberg said, before going on to list several options for Mr. Ladner, including opting out of the process and suing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One woman, a lawyer and politician, asked if there was a cap on emergency claims. (No.) Another man asked if the fund would pay for relocation costs if someone decided to leave the gulf because of the spill. (No.) One woman was curious about Mr. Feinberg himself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you're not with BP and you're not with the government, who are you with?'' she asked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My decisions are strictly my own,'' said Mr. Feinberg, a Washington lawyer who also handled the Sept. 11 victims' compensation fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The issue of proximity to the gulf, one of the more controversial qualifications for receiving a claim, did not arise in this beach town. But there were several pointed questions about Mr. Feinberg's policy on real estate reimbursement, and the askers came away dissatisfied. Under the terms of the fund, people can be compensated if they sold property and could prove that they received much less for it than they would have if the spill had not occurred. And they could be compensated for loss of rental income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a mere drop in property value, Mr. Feinberg said unequivocally, would not be compensated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Is he encouraging everybody on the Gulf Coast to dump their property?'' asked Mr. Ladner's brother, Kirk, who had been trying to sell beachfront property to developers before the spill. One group of developers walked away from about 13 acres and now, he said, no one wants to buy the property and he has no recourse in the claims process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What was most frustrating about that, said Mr. Lander's partner in the land deal, Russell Elliott, was that BP had seemed open to some sort of claim on lost property value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now he comes and throws it in the garbage,'' Mr. Elliott said. ''He's made a Catch-22. You can't sell it, but you can't collect until you sell.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While those who have already filed claims did not have to provide new documentation of their losses -- BP was handing over the paperwork -- they did have to refile their claims. Mr. Feinberg said that as of 9 a.m. more than 500 claims had been filed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beverly and Frank Fontenot, owners of Benigno's seafood restaurant, fueled themselves with coffee and stayed up until midnight to call the new claims hot line as soon as it opened for business. The person on the other end could not find their claim, but the Fontenots were still more confident about the new process 10 hours later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dealing with BP, Mr. Fontenot said, had been a nightmare. He says he could account for at least $60,000 in lost revenue over the summer, and he has only a $5,000 check from BP to show for it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Fontenot said she was cautiously optimistic about Mr. Feinberg.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I believe that this man with his experience has got to have some logic, some reason behind his thinking,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They filed a claim on Monday and were told they would receive the money within seven days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now,'' she said, ''we'll have to see how impressive he really is.''</p>

</div><div class="author">By DAVID STREITFELD </div><div>1201 words</div><div>23 August 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing will eventually recover from its great swoon. But many real estate experts now believe that home ownership will never again yield rewards like those enjoyed in the second half of the 20th century, when houses not only provided shelter but also a plump nest egg.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The wealth generated by housing in those decades, particularly on the coasts, did more than assure the owners a comfortable retirement. It powered the economy, paying for the education of children and grandchildren, keeping the cruise ships and golf courses full and the restaurants humming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than likely, that era is gone for good.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is no iron law that real estate must appreciate,'' said Stan Humphries, chief economist for the real estate site Zillow. ''All those theories advanced during the boom about why housing is special -- that more people are choosing to spend more on housing, that more people are moving to the coasts, that we were running out of usable land -- didn't hold up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, Mr. Humphries and other economists say, housing values will only keep up with inflation. A home will return the money an owner puts in each month, but will not multiply the investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, estimates that it will take 20 years to recoup the $6 trillion of housing wealth that has been lost since 2005. After adjusting for inflation, values will never catch up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People shouldn't look at a home as a way to make money because it won't,'' Mr. Baker said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the long term is grim, the short term is grimmer. Housing experts are bracing themselves for Tuesday, when the sales figures for July will be released. The data is expected to show a drop of as much as 20 percent from last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supply of homes sitting on the market might rise to as much as 12 months, about twice the level of a healthy market. That would push down prices as all those sellers compete to secure a buyer, adding to a slide that has already chopped off as much as 30 percent in home values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Set against this dismal present and a bleak future, buying a home is a willful act of optimism. That explains why Adam and Allison Lyons are waiting to close on a $417,500 house in Deerfield, Ill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're trying not to think too far ahead,'' said Ms. Lyons, 35, an information technology manager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple's first venture into real estate came in 2003 when they bought a condo in a 17-unit building under construction in Chicago. By the time they moved in two years later, it was already worth $50,000 more than they had paid. ''We were thinking, great!'' said Mr. Lyons, 34.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That quick appreciation started them on the same track as their parents, who watched the value of their houses ascend for decades. The real estate crash interrupted that pleasant dream. The couple cannot sell their condo. Unwillingly, they are becoming landlords.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't think we're ever going to see the prosperity our parents did, but I don't think it's all doom and gloom either,'' said Mr. Lyons, a manager at I.B.M. ''At some point, you just have to say what the heck and go for it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other buyers have grand and even grander expectations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an annual survey conducted by the economists Robert J. Shiller and Karl E. Case, hundreds of new owners in four communities -- Alameda County near San Francisco, Boston, Orange County south of Los Angeles, and Milwaukee -- once again said they believed prices would rise about 10 percent a year for the next decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With minor swings in sentiment, the latest results reflect what new buyers always seem to feel. At the boom's peak in 2005, they said prices would go up. When the market was sliding in 2008, they still said prices would go up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People think it's a law of nature,'' said Mr. Shiller, who teaches at Yale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the first half of the 20th century, he said, expectations followed the opposite path. Houses were seen the way cars are now: as a consumer durable that the buyer eventually used up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The notion of housing as an investment first began to blossom after World War II, when the nesting urges of returning soldiers created a construction boom. Demand was stoked as their bumper crop of children grew up and bought places of their own. The inflation of the 1970s, which increased the value of hard assets, and liberal tax policies both helped make housing a good bet. So did the long decline in mortgage rates from the early 1980s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite all these tailwinds, prices rose modestly for much of the period. Real home prices increased 1.1 percent a year after inflation, according to Mr. Shiller's research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the late 1990s, however, the rate was 4 percent a year. Happy homeowners were taking about $100 billion a year out of their houses, which paid for a lot of good times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The experience we had from the late 1970s to the late 1990s was an aberration,'' said Barry Ritholtz of the equity research firm Fusion IQ. ''People shouldn't be holding their breath waiting for it to happen again.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not everyone views the notion of real appreciation in real estate as a lost cause.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bob Walters, chief economist of the online mortgage firm Quicken, acknowledges that the recent collapse will create a ''mind scar'' just as the Great Depression did. But he argues that housing remains unique.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You have to live somewhere,'' he said. ''In three or four years, people will resume a normal course, and home values will continue to increase.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All homes are different, and some neighborhoods and regions will rebound more quickly. On the other hand, areas where there was intense overbuilding, like Arizona, will be extremely slow to show any sign of renewal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's entirely likely that markets like Arizona will not recover even in the 15- to 20-year time frame,'' said Mr. Humphries of Zillow. ''The demand doesn't exist.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Owners in those foreclosure-plagued areas consider themselves lucky if they are still solvent. But that does not prevent the occasional regret that a life-changing sum of money was so briefly within their grasp.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Austin, a Phoenix lawyer, paid $200,000 for his home in 2000. Five years later, his neighbors listed a similar home for $500,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Freedom beckoned. ''I thought, when my daughter gets out of school, I can sell the house and buy a boat and sail around the world,'' said Mr. Austin, 56.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His home is now worth about what he paid for it. As for that cruise, ''it may be a while,'' Mr. Austin said. Showing the hopefulness that is apparently innate to homeowners, he added: ''But I won't rule it out forever.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">JOHNS CREEK, Ga. -- Bit by bit, Larry Dean's life, at least as he had constructed it over the last two decades, was ebbing away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hundreds of strangers and many friends -- most in black dresses or dark suits -- showed up on Friday night for an estate sale here at Mr. Dean's Xanadu-like mansion, once the biggest home in metropolitan Atlanta. They scrutinized every object, from a $10 snow globe to a $60,000 dolphin-sculpture fountain. And many walked out the $17,500 leaded glass and mahogany double front doors, which came from the Chicago Cotton Exchange, with an artifact from Mr. Dean's past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Mr. Dean, a relentlessly upbeat software entrepreneur with cropped gray hair and a busker's aim to please, gladly watched it go.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's all good,'' he said, standing in the soaring rotunda of his megamansion, the pressure almost visibly rising off his shoulders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The estate sale brought down the curtain on a particular kind of spectacle, a rags-to-riches tale that somewhere along the way slipped into reverse and played itself out in the unforgiving glare of the real estate market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dean, 67, who grew up without indoor plumbing in a low-income section of Atlanta, founded a financial services software company, Stockholder Systems Inc., in the early 1970s and became a millionaire many times over. He and his first wife, Lynda, spent four years and $25 million building their own private Versailles, which they called ''Dean Gardens'' and finished in 1992. Their architect, Bill Harrison, said each square inch of it was given the attention to detail of a Faberge egg.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Deans' dream was to raise their four children here in an atmosphere like ''Dynasty,'' ''only happy,'' and then leave the 58-acre estate, with its 18-hole golf course, wedding chapel, band shell and formal gardens to a foundation that would open it to the public for charity events.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in 1993, shortly after finishing the house, the Deans separated and the house went on the market. It has languished there for the last 17 years. One potential buyer, Mr. Dean said, was Michael Jackson, who wanted the place in 1994 as a surprise for his fiancee, Lisa Marie Presley. But when the media reported Mr. Jackson's plan and ruined the surprise, he did not sign the contract. Mr. Dean would not say how much Mr. Jackson was going to pay, but the home was on the market for $40 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, at last, the estate has sold -- for $7.6 million. The buyer, the entertainment mogul Tyler Perry, has said he plans to demolish it and build his own home, one that is environmentally friendly and made of concrete.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in the Atlanta area, where a developer built a replica of the White House replete with its own Lincoln Bedroom and Oval Office, Dean Gardens stands out. At 32,000 square feet, it is nearly twice as big as the Atlanta White House. And its incongruity of interior styles, combining Egyptian, Renaissance, Vegas and more, has been a source of amusement, if not horror, to some who have attended charity events there or seen pictures online.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joan Rivers mocked it on her television program, ''How'd You Get So Rich?'' When she saw a bed surrounded by an elaborate pink and green flower frame, she gasped that it looked like a float she once rode in the Rose Bowl Parade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bloggers and commentators have been merciless about what they see as a collision of self-indulgence, bad taste and a waste of money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''After seeing the inside of this house, it's no wonder at all that they divorced,'' one person wrote after a glimpse via the Internet on hookedonhouses.net. ''I can't imagine anyone being happy living in that monstrosity. Perhaps they should turn it into a prison.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Oy,'' wrote another. ''I'm so embarrassed to be an Atlantan right now. A few years ago, Atlanta was voted the No. 1 city in the country with 'most conspicuous consumption.' I guess this would be the feather in that cap!''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hank Miller, an associate broker and appraiser with Prudential Georgia Realty, said the real value of the property is in the land. ''The land is worth more than the structure, which is why they're going to take it down,'' Mr. Miller said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jenny Pruitt, co-founder and chief executive of Atlanta Fine Homes Sotheby's International Realty, whose firm sold Dean Gardens after taking over the listing last year, said, ''The luxury-home market has been hit very hard, and this was a very special property.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sale price, Ms. Pruitt said, is the highest in Atlanta so far this year, but considerably lower than an $11 million sale last year. And it could easily be made up in tax credits, she said, if Mr. Perry exercises the property's conservation rights, given its extensive waterfront along the Chattahoochee River.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dean said he was mostly relieved about the sale, which will mean the end of $1 million in annual upkeep, which his first wife had been paying in recent years. On top of the $25 million cost of building the house, they spent an additional $18 million over the years to pay for staff, taxes and utilities, for a total of $43 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I didn't get a dime out of the sale of the house,'' Mr. Dean said. ''I own all the personal effects. That's why I'm having the sale,'' though some of the proceeds are going to charities. ''The $7.6 million went to pay off the back debts. I owed Lynda more than the buyer paid for it. The buyer basically stole the house.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Mr. Dean absorbs the lessons of his experience and faces life with his fortune greatly depleted by divorces and upkeep costs for the house, he said he regretted building the house. If he had it to do all over again, he said, he would not. Still, he thinks of himself as happy and successful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dean, divorced for a third time and looking for wife No. 4, said he planned to move to Florida and would probably write a book on Internet dating, which he says has been a letdown. Everyone lies, he said, especially about their age and weight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dean said he thought the sale would be harder on his oldest son, Chris, who at 21 was given the task of decorating the house and now, at 43, is still trying to come to terms with the experience. It was his first effort at decorating something on such a grand scale; he made one more effort, which ended in disaster, and retired from interior decorating at age 24.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our whole family is coming to the end of a chapter,'' Chris Dean said wistfully. ''This was so wonderful at the beginning, and so new, then after their divorce, when Mom moved out, it lost its life.'' He said he missed his mother's cooking and her cakes and pies that filled the countertop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It became almost like a mausoleum sitting here with nobody using it,'' he said. ''That was more heartbreaking than having it torn down.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: August 29, 2010, Sunday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about an estate sale at a 32,000-square-foot mansion near Atlanta referred incorrectly to Tyler Perry, the entertainment mogul who purchased the estate for $7.6 million. It should have read ''Mr. Perry,'' not ''Mr. Tyler.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE recession has not been kind to many new condominium developments in New York City. Some have stalled midconstruction; others have shuttered their sales offices because of inactivity; some developers have had to return deposits to buyers as prices took a nosedive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But two years after the real estate market seized up, some of the hardest-hit developments have found ways to rise from the ashes. In some cases, the original developers avoided default by renegotiating their construction loans, and in others new developers stepped in and took over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all cases, the need for reinvention has been paramount.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To adjust to a market strikingly different from the high-flying one that reigned when these projects were conceived, developers have not only created new marketing campaigns but also substantially changed the buildings themselves. Focusing less on trendiness and more on value, they have redesigned lobbies, combined apartments to create more family-sized units, and swapped luxuries like private roof cabanas for shared amenities like common roof decks. The changes all seek to appeal to today's much more skeptical buyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At be@schermerhorn, a 246-unit condo in downtown Brooklyn that stood unfinished and vacant for most of 2009, a new owner started selling apartments in the building three months ago, after deciding to broaden the target audience of buyers and also creating amenities like storage space and a roof deck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We retooled the project to what we think fits the market today,'' said Michael Phillips, the creative director of Jamestown Properties, an original investor that has now taken over both the building and the troubled mortgage of the developer, SDS Procida. The changes that Jamestown made were ''less about grand gestures and more about sensitivity to consumer interest,'' Mr. Phillips said. ''Maybe in the last economy, big, glossy marketing and overpromising was acceptable, but that's really not relevant for buyers today.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In early 2009 the project went over budget, lenders cut off financing, construction stopped and contractors put liens on the property. Curbed.com dubbed it a ''zombie building,'' and when given the chance most of the 40 buyers took their deposits and ran.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jamestown assumed control in late 2009 and decided that the original marketing plan aimed at 20-somethings was too limited. ''We wanted to cast a wider net and appeal to young families and empty-nesters and maybe be a little less trendy,'' Mr. Phillips said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first brochures had pronounced, ''be@ is not just an address, it's an attitude,'' and had shown beautiful young people dining out or shooting pool. New marketing materials promise ''clean styling and attractive pricing,'' and feature a child reaching for a juice box at a local market and an older gentleman leaving the building with his dog.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inside the building, bold design colors were traded for more neutral ones; part of the parking garage was converted to 60 storage units; and six private roof cabanas were turned into a common roof deck. Jamestown also cut prices by 25 percent and obtained approval for loans through the Federal Housing Administration to help buyers get financing. After three months back on the market, they have about 140 accepted offers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tarsha Carvey and her partner, Iris Mulero, stuck with the building, despite being offered three chances to cancel their 2009 contract for a one-bedroom for under $400,000. ''I knew that 80 percent of the people were pulling out,'' said Ms. Carvey, who works as an executive assistant at Nickelodeon, ''but I don't like to follow the crowd.'' The couple now are looking at a larger one-bedroom with a home office for the same price, with the building's blessing. ''The whole energy of the building now is very classy,'' she said, ''and it's a lot more high-end than I ever expected it to be.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The storage units and the roof deck were big selling points for Andon George and Paula McCreedy, who are nearly empty-nesters, as their son, Alex, is a recent college graduate. They are in contract for a two-bedroom for $542,000, and they also bought a storage unit ''for all the records and files that one accumulates over a lifetime,'' said Mr. George, who is an architect. The deck, with its expansive harbor and city views, helped them imagine living beyond the walls of their apartment, he added, because ''we can have people over for dinner and start with a drink on the roof.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new roof terrace has also figured in recent sales at Warehouse 11, a 120-unit building in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, that was stalled for most of 2009 and was reintroduced early this year. The developer, McCaren Park Mews LLC, defaulted on a $50 million mortgage, filed for bankruptcy and negotiated the loan down to $35.5 million. In the process, about 30 buyers were released from their contracts and real estate blogs had a field day describing the project as a failure that had been exposed to the elements for too long and was most likely falling apart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building first opened for sales in the summer of 2008, right before the market went into free fall. David Maundrell, the president of aptsandlofts.com, which has handled marketing for the building, said the 2008 sales activity provided ''an opportunity to look at what didn't work the first time and change things.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan had called for a children's playroom and 60 private roof cabanas. ''But there was no interest at all in a playroom because the family market in Williamsburg is still developing,'' Mr. Maundrell said. No one was buying cabanas, either. So the playroom was replaced with a billiard/television room, and the cabanas were removed to create a common roof deck. Prices were also dropped, by 25 to 35 percent, and the building is now nearly 80 percent sold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leonardo and Valeria Caputi recently bought a top-floor apartment and a parking space for $590,000. The apartment alone had been priced at $750,000 in 2008. The Caputis moved from Bayside, Queens, and Mr. Caputi said, ''I don't want to be dramatic, but there's not a morning when we wake up that we're not excited to be here.'' They love being one subway stop from Manhattan and one block from McCarren Park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Caputis were well aware of Warehouse 11's bad press, but Mr. Caputi, who works in law enforcement, said that Mr. Maundrell ''didn't shy away from any of it, and he kept us apprised of what was being done to deal with any issues.'' He added, ''So far, we haven't had any problems with the building.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Caputi said that the roof's panoramic views of Manhattan, Brooklyn and beyond had helped persuade them to buy. The Caputis have made a point of going up to the roof deck every evening, ''even if it's just for five minutes, just to look at the city and take it all in.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But other projects in Williamsburg, which may have the city's highest concentration of stalled developments, have not been reborn as condos. The 40-unit building at 349 Metropolitan Avenue was planned as a condo but recently opened as a rental. It was nearly 70 percent sold in the summer of 2008, when the developer, 349 Metropolitan Avenue LLC, defaulted on its construction loan and returned buyers' deposits. While the building sat vacant, vandals tagged the limestone facade with graffiti, and chunks of the first-floor facade were stripped off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When another developer, Masada Metropolitan LLC, stepped in about eight months ago and bought the original developer's $12 million loan for $6.3 million, the first thing it did was replace the facade. ''It was ugly,'' said Nissim Ben-nun, a principal of Masada. ''But the real reason we changed it was it was unsafe.'' The new facade is a blend of stone and plate glass. And to bring some of the Williamsburg arts scene into the building, they commissioned R. Nicholas Kuszyk, a local artist, to paint a four-story mural in an interior courtyard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to paying off the bank, Mr. Ben-nun said, he also had to spend $3 million to clear contractors' liens, an additional $2 million to get clear title to the property from the original developer, and $1 million more to replace the facade and finish construction. ''Financially I'd be better off selling'' the apartments as condos, he said, ''but I decided to rent it and own it for a while, maybe leave it to my kids.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Maundrell, who is also marketing the building, said that selling it as condos would have taken seven to eight months but that he felt certain he could rent it more quickly. At the first open house earlier this month, 21 of the 40 apartments were rented at current market rates, with one-bedrooms listed for about $2,200 and two-bedrooms about $2,800.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some developers with stalled projects are confident that after a hiatus of a year or longer, now may be a good time to reintroduce their buildings, because prices have stabilized. This is the case for the Lotta condominium, on 118th Street in Harlem, and 1 Rector Park, in Battery Park City. Both buildings were rentals that developers had decided to turn into condos, and both came to market just as the economy started to hit the skids in 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Lotta had one out of 34 apartments in contract when the developers, Gal Sela and Eli Idi, decided to take the condos off the market in August 2008 and instead turned the building into a youth hostel. For about $40 a night, travelers could rent a bunk bed in an apartment with stone counters, Kohler bath fixtures and Italian design kitchen cabinets. The cabinets were outfitted with locks so guests could have personal storage space, but the stainless steel kitchen appliances weren't hooked up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tourists filled rooms that had up to six bunk beds and attended events like pub crawls, rooftop cocktail gatherings and holiday parties in the lounge. But city officials shut down the hostel in April because it had only one stairway exit, which is inadequate for as many as 260 hostel guests, but fine for a typically smaller condo population.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gilad Azaria, an agent with Prudential Douglas Elliman who will be the sales director for the Lotta when it reopens in the fall, said the owners had decided to turn the building back into a condominium ''because the market looks good right now'' and it would have been difficult to meet building requirements to keep it a hostel. Mr. Azaria said the hostel had provided a good way for the owners ''to stay afloat, hold the building and get through the recession.'' It was enough of a success that the owners are planning a new hostel in Long Island City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before opening the condo, they will refinish the apartments and redesign the building's public spaces. One-bedrooms will sell for about $350,000 and two-bedrooms for about $550,000, roughly 20 percent less than original asking prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 1 Rector Park, some prices will be more than 50 percent lower than in 2008. Apartments back then were listed at $957 to $1,585 per square foot, and prices now will range from $417 to $1,304 per square foot. Studios will be available for $300,000; one-bedrooms for $365,000 to $760,000; and two bedrooms from $775,000 to $1.17 million. The developer also created some three- and four-bedroom apartments with price tags upward of $2 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Originally, about 10 percent of the 174 apartments had gone into contract, but by mid-2009, the developer, Buttonwood Real Estate, had failed to hit its sales goals and had to turn the keys over to the lender, <span class="companylink">iStar Financial</span>, which in late 2009 hired Corcoran Sunshine to help ''reposition'' the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Lansill, a senior managing director of Corcoran Sunshine, said many of the original design elements ''didn't seem as relevant to the economy today.'' The lobby design, for example, started out with the feel of a night club, with a lot of dark wood, and was replaced with lighter tones and softer furniture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like the new developers of be@schermerhorn, the new developer for 1 Rector Park decided to broaden its target audience. Model apartments originally had a sleek aesthetic meant to lure younger buyers. Mr. Lansill says his marketing team has developed character profiles to reflect a more diverse buying population and has had designers create model apartments accordingly. The characters include a young single man who has just moved from California to be a banker; a couple whose grown children have moved out; a family with two children and a third on the way; a young married couple obsessed with cooking; and a divorced woman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the most noticeable change is in the building's Web site and marketing materials, which Mr. Lansill described as ''radical'' in their simplicity. The home page of the site offers three ways to search for an apartment: by price, size, or view. ''There's no image of the project, no hip-y line about how it's the most luxurious place where you will live,'' he said. ''You get pure information instantly, and not at the 17th screen after you've been bludgeoned with all this information about lifestyle.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reason for such directness? ''We're in a dramatically changed market from where we were two years ago,'' Mr. Lansill said. ''Buyers are skeptical now, and they don't want to be information-starved.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added that since prices had been lowered so much, ''we are going to offer one price, no negotiation.'' They have done their research and can show buyers that the apartments are priced below the competition in the area, he said. A week after the Web site went up, there were 31 contracts at full price, almost double the number of sales the first time around.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HERE'S what a lagging market looks like in Alpine, N.J., the town perennially identified by Forbes Magazine as one of the ''most expensive'' ZIP codes in the country:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The average home price, which was $4.3 million last year, is hovering at $2 million so far this year, according to Multiple Listing Service data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are currently 61 homes multiply listed (and more being marketed privately). But only one house per month was sold in the first seven months of this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most expensive house to sell this year was a five-bedroom four-bath dwelling on Charney Drive -- the exact house number was kept private -- which went for $3.525 million. Last year a house on Litchfield Way sold for more than three times that, $14.9 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a very difficult environment,'' said Richard J. Kurtz, whose 30,000-square-foot stone mansion on the Henry Clay Frick estate in Alpine is on the market for $68 million. (The price is believed to be a record for New Jersey, and among the top asking prices right now anywhere in the United States, according to Forbes.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kurtz said four potential buyers had shown ''legitimate interest'' since the house was completed this spring. Three are foreigners and one is a Wall Street broker, said Mr. Kurtz, who is president of the real estate company Kamson Corporation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, he said, negotiations are under way -- ''we are actually talking numbers'' -- with another mansion-shopper from overseas about the historic Frick home on the estate and its 27 pristine acres of land, listed at $57 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These are special people in terms of who and what they are,'' said Mr. Kurtz of the potential buyers. ''They are still out there in the world, and that is who Alpine continues to attract.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A community of around 3,000 residents and 915 real estate parcels, Alpine is 16 miles from Midtown Manhattan. Last year it ranked No. 1 on the Forbes ritzy ZIP code list, knocking out Fishers Island in Florida, and towns like Atherton, Calif., with which it had previously tied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was three years ago that Mr. Kurtz, himself a longtime resident of Alpine, bought the entire 60-acre estate from Mr. Frick, the overseer of the Frick Collection in Manhattan founded by his grandfather, a steel magnate. Mr. Kurtz divided the wooded and pond-studded property into eight pieces of real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two smaller pieces of the land quickly sold; this spring a contract was signed on a third piece, 5.76 acres, for more than $15 million, according to Mr. Kurtz's broker, Dennis McCormack, the managing director of Prominent Properties Sotheby's International Realty in Alpine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I am going to guess that they will end up spending another $15 million to build a house there,'' Mr. McCormack said, though he conceded that the market was very slow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, even though ''there are a lot fewer transactions,'' Mr. McCormack said, ''one reason for that is that sellers here don't need to rush to the exits during a down cycle in the market. They do not have to sell, and they just take their homes off the market for a year, two years, or whatever it takes for values to rise again.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has been marketing the home of the actor and comedian Eddie Murphy, at a ''reduced'' price of $12.5 million, for about two years. Before that, another broker had listed the property for $30 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alpine has been a haven for entertainment and sports figures who want to hang their hats somewhere private: The Yankees pitcher C. C. Sabathia moved in last year; the rapper Sean Combs is a resident, as is the prominent laser eye surgeon Dr. Joseph V. Dello Russo Jr.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to historical listing data compiled by the Otteau Valuation Group, in New Brunswick, the number of homes sold in Alpine has shrunk in the past few years. Five years ago, 37 houses were sold, or roughly 3 per month. That year the median price -- which means half of the homes sold cost more and half cost less -- was $2.15 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the peak year of 2007, 19 properties sold, but the median rose to $3.75 million. So far this year, the median for the seven properties sold is $1.9 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, Mr. McCormack said, properties in Alpine may be holding their value better than in other towns in Bergen County (his agency has offices throughout the county).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason, he said, is that Alpine has the lowest property tax rate in Bergen. Recently, he had two homes on the market: one a newer house in Alpine with 6,000 square feet of living space, with an asking price of $4.995 million, and an annual tax bill of $18,800; the other, a slightly larger house in neighboring Cresskill, , on sale for $4.5 million, and annual taxes of $73,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Even if a buyer doesn't need financing to buy the house,'' Mr. McCormack said, ''why would they want to pay that much more per year?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeffrey G. Otteau, who heads Otteau Valuation, said he doubted that for ''elite'' buyers, property taxes had much to do with it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Otteau suggested that to get a true picture of what is happening with the market in Alpine ''outlier'' sales should be taken out of the equations -- including Mr. Kurtz's purchase of the Frick property -- because they skew the computations, especially when it comes to average prices. By that measure, the average price of a home in Alpine last year would have been something under $3 million rather than the $4.3 million figure that made it Forbes' No. 1, Mr. Otteau noted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to his analysis, the average home price in Alpine has held reasonably steady around $2.5 million for the past five years.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OAKLAND, Calif. -- When first conceived by its original developer, Oakland City Walk seemed a safe bet. The four-building condominium complex stands two blocks from the ornate tower of City Hall and directly across the street from the city's largest office buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when the flow of credit dried up in the summer of 2007, the high-profile City Walk turned into a white elephant for the developer, the Olson Company of Seal Beach, Calif., and an embarrassment for the city. ''It was really annoying,'' said Patrick Lane, the city's redevelopment director.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, after months of studying the project at what he described as ''a granular level,'' Frank Middleton, the western regional director for Wood Partners, an apartment developer in Atlanta, gave the go-ahead for his company to buy City Walk for $5 million, a fraction of its projected cost. Shortly afterward, Wood Partners resumed work on the project, which is expected to cost a total of $55 million to finish and is being partly financed by a loan from the City of Oakland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Mr. Middleton first toured City Walk last summer, the red-painted steel frame of the six-story complex remained as visible as it had in July 2007, when the general contractor filed for bankruptcy and construction halted. In the interim, rain had ruined much of the plasterboard and wooden cabinetry inside the roofless building. Part of the exterior, wrapped in plastic sheeting, resembled an installation by the artist Christo in poor repair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city's $5 million loan to Wood Partners is part of Oakland's commitment to bring thousands of residents to downtown. Started 10 years ago by Jerry Brown, the mayor at the time, the 10K initiative had a goal of attracting 10,000 new residents to the area through the construction of at least 6,000 housing units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The program has exceeded its original goal in terms of construction. To date, about 4,200 condominiums and rental apartments have been completed, an additional 510 are under construction and permits have been granted for roughly 4,000 other units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The goal of the 10K program was to create a 24-hour downtown area, through the creation of new housing and commercial development, particularly restaurants and retailers, Mr. Lane said. The city assisted the initiative by assembling and selling city-owned sites to developers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the downtown area experienced a glut of rental units shortly after the credit crisis, when several large condominium projects were converted to rental, the occupancy rate at the end of June was 91.6 percent, while the average rent was $1,361, according to a report by <span class="companylink">Red Capital Group</span> of Columbus, Ohio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Throughout a spottily developed downtown, new four- and five-story condominium and apartment complexes have risen in the last decade like Modernist mushrooms amid the aging one- and two-story storefronts, some dating back more than a century.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least two earlier attempts to sell City Walk fell apart, Mr. Middleton said. Consultants' reports had described downtown Oakland as a saturated housing market, and some prospective buyers had contemplated buying the complex and waiting until a rebound in the housing market to complete it, or even demolishing it and selling the construction materials.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Middleton said he was skeptical of some conclusions drawn by financial experts. ''They're just looking at numbers,'' he said of the consultants. ''They don't know the area.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In June 2009, Mr. Middleton sent his wife and children on vacation, while choosing to spend six weeks exploring downtown Oakland, hanging out in bars and observing pedestrian traffic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I waited until the last train left at 2 a.m. to see what would happen to the street life,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although sections of Oakland remain plagued by crime, downtown seemed safe and hospitable, Mr. Middleton said, who reported seeing sidewalks full of pedestrians well past midnight. Many of those people were young, single professionals who had chosen to live in Oakland, which is less expensive than neighboring San Francisco, and connected to the larger city by the BART rail system and the Bay Bridge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oakland, with its relatively lower commercial rents, was also attracting start-up businesses. ''The real estate market was supposed to be at an all-time low, and here are all these new restaurants opening up,'' said Brian Pianca, the Bay Area director for Wood Partners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Middleton then reread what he described as a ''roomful of reports, sitting in boxes,'' from consultants about the market. One assumption he challenged was that downtown Oakland was overbuilt. The number of completed units, he said, was far less than the total number of units that had been approved for construction. And despite the recession, the demand for housing in the Bay Area remained moderately high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The developers decided to ''reposition'' City Walk from a condo complex to a rental complex, focusing on young professionals who worked in San Francisco and elsewhere in the Bay Area, but who wanted the comparatively lower rents available in Oakland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wood Partners, following an industry practice, would not disclose the intended rental rates, saying it would wait until the completion of construction to set the rates competitively. Completion is set for mid-2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To appeal to its target audience of renters, Wood Partners added new amenities to the 256-unit complex, including a business center with computers and other office equipment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the top floor, where the original developer had intended high-price penthouses with enormous balconies, Wood Partners converted the private balconies into common areas suitable for open-air barbecues, with views of the bay and the San Francisco skyline, including the Bay Bridge and the Golden Gate Bridge on opposite ends of the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You can see San Francisco better from here than from the city itself,'' Mr. Pianca said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the executives at Wood Partners were sold on Oakland, convincing lenders to finance construction was difficult. The partners said they were turned down by 80 lenders before receiving most of the financing from Berkshire Property Advisors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The loan package was $5 million short of the plan drawn up by the developers. After considerable public debate, the Oakland City Council in April approved a market-rate loan for that amount, and developers quickly completed the purchase and started construction, retaining the original architect, MVE &amp;Partners of Irvine, Calif., to prepare new construction documents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the project needed to be redesigned in part, Ernesto Vasquez, a principal of MVE, said he was not put off by the complexity of resuming work on a project that was 60 percent finished. ''I've lived through at least four recessions as an architect,'' he said, ''so we've had several experiences in working on buildings that have been left unfinished.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And to give the project a new image, the developers have renamed it Domain at Alta. ''We thought the City Walk brand had been tarnished,'' Mr. Middleton said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lane, the Oakland city official, said he was pleased to see the project finally turn back into an asset after lying dormant for three years. ''Now I can check off the box that says 'complete,' '' he said.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the real estate boom a couple of years ago, developers were buying up lots and preselling condo units for buildings that had yet to be built. And people were scooping up these units at premium prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, as we all know, the bottom fell out, leaving buyers in contracts to purchase units that were worth less than the price they had agreed to pay. And these buyers were stuck - walking away, they were told, would mean the loss of their down payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in a ruling this week in federal court in Manhattan, a judge let three purchasers of units in a downtown condo building out of their contracts - and said they were entitled to receive their down payments back - using an old, little-used federal law.The decision, the first of its kind in New York, has generated some buzz in the world of New York real estate law, as it may provide an outlet for dozens, if not hundreds, of buyers who are bound to worthless investments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The law is the Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act. Created in 1968 to prevent land speculators from selling uninhabitable plots, the act requires developers of condos with at least 100 units to provide purchasers with a property report detailing information like proof of ownership and the availability of public utilities. Under the act, a report must also be filed with the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development. If those report are not filed, the purchaser could back out of the agreement within two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are many exemptions to this law, however. One of them is if the developer obligates itself to complete the property within two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the case decided by Judge George B. Daniels of Federal District Court in Manhattan, three people had signed purchasing contracts in 2007 and 2008 for condos in a 163-unit building being developed at 111 Fulton Street. The developer was a company owned by the Israeli billionaire Lev Leviev.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Leviev's company never made the filings required under the interstate disclosure act, but it argued that it was exempt because it had obligated itself to finish the project within two years. And in fact, the condos were completed within two years, the developer argued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite that, Judge Daniels wrote in a 13-page opinion that the developer only said in its contract that it ''anticipated'' that the units would be completed in two years. The contract ''provides no legal compulsion upon the defendant to construct the units within two years of purchase,'' the judge wrote.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least one local real estate lawyer said he found it troublesome that even if a unit were completed within the two-year time frame, developers could still be liable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think it's tricky territory,'' said James E. Schwartz, a real estate partner in the law firm Mitchell Silberberg &amp;Knupp. ''The developer indeed finished this thing within two years, but because it hadn't obligated itself to do that, it's out of luck.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Lawrence C. Weiner, the lawyer who represented the purchasers in this case, said the law provided much-needed consumer protection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If these federal requirements were not in place, you could have a situation where there could be delays for years and years,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The practice by developers in New York has generally been to ignore filing the disclosures required by the federal disclosure act because New York has its own laws and extensive review process with the attorney general's office regarding developments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For a developer to ignore this just because they think they have sufficient protection under state law is just foolish,'' Mr. Weiner said. ''Developers chose to ignore it at their own peril.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of Judge Daniels's ruling, Mr. Weiner said he expected developers would now make the required filings. And because buyers have to make claims under the disclosure act within two years of the purchase, Mr. Weiner said he did not expect a flood of these cases in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are, however, many currently existing. Mr. Weiner said he had about 50 cases pending involving 10 buildings in the city. He estimated that there were 100 to 120 pending claims across the city that rely on the federal disclosure act.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Schwartz, who was not involved in this case but typically represents developers, said that buildings where numerous purchasers were suing to get out of their agreements could force some developers into bankruptcy. ''You don't have a cash flow to pay off your lenders,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For his part, Douglas P. Heller, a real estate partner at Herrick, Feinstein, said he thought the federal disclosure act was useless when it came to New York real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This to me has gotten to be a big joke,'' he said, adding that the reports required by the act ''give you a lot of irrelevant detail and some repetition of what's already in the offering plan.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The billionaire hedge fund manager William A. Ackman has great ambitions for Stuyvesant Town, but he is also taking considerable risks. The sprawling apartment complex on the East Side of Manhattan could end up being either a cash cow or a huge headache for Mr. Ackman, who runs <span class="companylink">Pershing Square Capital Management</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Success will depend not only on the health of the real estate market in New York City, but also on Mr. Ackman's ability to convince creditors, tenants and the city government that he is looking out for their best interests while trying to make a profit. Mr. Ackman outlined his plan to DealBook.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ackman's plan for the Stuyvesant Town/Peter Cooper Village complex boils down to what would effectively be the largest co-op conversion in history. Mr. Ackman, along with his partner, <span class="companylink">Winthrop Realty Trust</span>, will do what real estate moguls have done for decades in Manhattan: convert rental buildings into chic co-ops - just on an enormous scale. It can be viewed as a classic sum-of-the-parts deal, in which the individual apartments are worth more than the whole complex.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ackman's plan differs from that of the complex's previous owners, Tishman Speyer Properties and BlackRock, which wanted to renovate and keep Stuyvesant Town as a rental complex. The two firms bought the complex in 2006 at the height of the real estate boom for $5.4 billion, which was the largest residential real estate deal in history. They put up just $112 million of their own money to take control of the complex. The rest of the deal was financed in the debt markets, with a $1.4 billion mezzanine loan and a $3 billion mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time of the purchase, the rents for the properties covered only 58 percent of the debt payments. That is because about three-fourths of the apartments are covered by the city's rent-stabilization laws, meaning that many of the apartments have been renting for half to two-thirds of their market value. The deal assumed that rental income from the two properties would triple by 2011 by converting a large number of those rent-stabilized apartments to market rent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, that did not happen. The owners could not raise rents high enough in their free-market rentals to cover their huge debt bill, in part because of the faltering economy. Meanwhile, Tishman was having trouble converting the rent-stabilized units to free-market units. The rent-stabilized tenants fought Tishman every step of the way. Tishman and BlackRock burned through $890 million in reserve funds and then defaulted on their mortgage in January of this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Enter Mr. Ackman. He recently bought $300 million worth of the complex's senior mezzanine debt at 15 cents on the dollar, or $45 million total, and began a campaign to take control of Stuyvesant Town. To do that, he will need CW Partners, the debt servicer in control of the $3 billion mortgage, to agree to put the complex into bankruptcy and then cede control.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So by purchasing the mezzanine debt and foreclosing on the existing equity, Mr. Ackman would effectively be paying a little over $3 billion for the property. He may end up having to pay even more if he gets in a bidding war with the billionaire financier Wilbur L. Ross Jr., who has also interested in taking over Stuyvesant Town.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ackman's plan is to assume the $3 billion mortgage in its entirety and make monthly payments. He is not obligated to pay off the mortgage debt in advance; in fact, he said the bondholders would prefer it that way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The bondholders don't want cash now," Mr. Ackman told DealBook. "They bought an instrument that has six or seven years to go on which they were earning interest and that's what they want."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with the property currently valued at $1.8 billion by Fitch Ratings, how will Mr. Ackman make money?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At $3 billion, Mr. Ackman would be paying about $300 a square foot for Stuyvesant Town. That is around a third of the value of recent sales in the area. That gives Mr. Ackman a lot of room to profit - that is, if he is successful in selling a large majority of the units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is where it gets complicated. The co-op conversion would assign shares in a corporation to each of the apartments based on the size of the unit and its location within the complex. The tenants would have the first right to buy those shares and effectively own their apartment. The tenants, regardless of how long they have been there, would be offered a discounted insider rate to buy the shares.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ackman has agreed on a noneviction conversion, meaning that rent-stabilized tenants cannot be thrown out for failing to buy into the corporation, while free-market tenants would be able to continue living at the property through the end of their leases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Even if you sell units at a significant discount to market - with market being somewhere around $800 to $900 a square foot - that should be enough to pay down the mortgage and deal with the fact that we will have units that will be losing money," Mr. Ackman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 40 percent of the rentals are free market, so that means Mr. Ackman could renovate them when they become vacant and flip them quickly at market prices. At $800 a square foot and assuming 40 percent of the rentals equals 40 percent of the complex's square footage, Mr. Ackman could make nearly $3.5 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that is assuming those rentals stay free market. A judge has ruled that the previous owners of Stuyvesant Town improperly converted many rent-stabilized units to market rent. That means many of those units appear likely to get their rent-stabilized lease back, throwing off the whole equation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If a large number of apartments are returned back to rent stabilization, Mr. Ackman would need the majority of Stuyvesant Town residents to buy their units for more than $300 a square foot. But while some tenants might see this as a good investment, others might not have the cash for a down payment, especially given the downturn in the economy - or their rents may be cheap enough that buying does not make sense.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the average size of an apartment at Stuyvesant town's being 911 square feet, according to Mr. Ackman, that would mean that if it sells at about $600 a square foot, which is well below market price, it would cost about $546,600. The buyer would need to put up nearly $110,000 cash for a 20 percent down payment. The monthly payment, with a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 6 percent, plus assuming $1,500 a month for maintenance and taxes, would total about $4,100 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A 5 percent mortgage would bring that total monthly payment down to about $3,850, but that is still higher than market rents of about $3,000 a month for similar amount of space. (The rent-stabilized tenants pay probably half that amount.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Based on those numbers, it looks as if tenants will be paying considerably more than their current rent to own at Stuyvesant Town, even factoring in tax savings. Many will probably choose to continue paying below-market rates (as in many cases, it would be below the maintenance costs), which will eat away at any profits made from the sale of free-market units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ackman could have a fighting chance of profiting if New York City agrees to lower his property tax payments. The city government could also give tax abatements to new owners, which would make the units more marketable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ackman says he has other ideas for profiting from Stuyvesant Town, but he does not want to disclose them. Given the recent history of the apartment complex and the way the numbers are currently playing out, he will probably need every one of them.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the early 1990s, with New York City eager to find creative ways of rehabilitating its troubled neighborhoods, it struck a multimillion-dollar deal with the Greater Harlem Chamber of Commerce: The city sold the chamber a collection of dilapidated Harlem apartment buildings for a nominal amount, and arranged for close to $10 million in low-cost loans to help fix and restore the buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal could hardly have gone worse -- in almost every way, and over many, many years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chamber's development arm twice faced foreclosure on the collection of properties; utility bills went unpaid, and renovations were never done.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, in 2008, after years of failed promises to run the buildings effectively, the Bloomberg administration chose to invest additional millions with the chamber's development arm, known formally as Greater Harlem Housing Development Corporation. It awarded the group a $2.55 million forgivable loan, essentially a grant, to take care of long-neglected rehabilitation work. Now, two years later, there is evidence this investment has proved as troubled and disappointing as the first one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A review of the public record makes clear the decision to award the money came just as the administration was in the final push to gain City Council approval for one of its largest and most controversial neighborhood rezoning initiatives, a plan to change the rules for development in an area that straddles 125th Street, Harlem's main thoroughfare.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such things do not move forward without the approval of the local council member. And in Harlem, that person was Inez E. Dickens, a woman with a lifetime's worth of connections to the Harlem chamber and its president, Lloyd A. Williams. Ms. Dickens's father had been president of the chamber before Mr. Williams; she had served on its board; and Mr. Williams had been among her few fund-raisers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Dickens had initially spoken against Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's rezoning plan for Harlem. The plan -- which involved things like initiatives for housing and rules on the heights of new buildings -- had provoked fierce neighborhood opposition from those who feared that remaking the neighborhood's signature thoroughfare would price out longtime residents and businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But on April 30, 2008, Ms. Dickens threw her support behind the plan, and directed her colleagues on the City Council to approve it, a decision that provoked jeers and taunting from dozens of Harlem residents who had turned up at City Hall. The same day, the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development notified Mr. Williams that it was finalizing the $2.55 million grant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Dickens declined a request for an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eric Bederman, a spokesman for the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, said there was no connection between the approval of the loan and Ms. Dickens's support for the rezoning plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new loan has yet to yield much beyond additional problems. Repair work that was supposed to be done to the more than dozen buildings along 135th Street in the heart of Harlem has not been completed; building code violations that were to be corrected are still unresolved. And in court filings this year, Mr. Williams conceded that Greater Harlem Housing was ''unable to manage and fund the operation of the properties on its own.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Multiplying Problems</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Harlem Chamber of Commerce was founded in 1896 to advocate for and assist uptown businesses. In recent decades, it has taken on more sweeping pursuits. In 1993, for instance, the group formed an arm devoted to developing low-income housing, the Greater Harlem Housing Development Corporation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next year, a special committee formed by the chamber personally urged Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to let the chamber take over distressed city-owned properties. Two members of that committee were Mr. Williams and Ms. Dickens. ''This needs to happen quickly,'' Mr. Williams wrote in a March 1994 letter to Mr. Giuliani.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three months later, the city and Mr. Williams signed a deal to sell nine city-owned properties to Greater Harlem Housing for $38,000. The group bought four additional properties from private sellers for about $350,000. The properties, on or near 135th Street between Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard and Frederick Douglass Boulevard, held 117 rent-stabilized apartments and 11 commercial spaces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Problems soon emerged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1997, Greater Harlem Housing faced foreclosure. One of the lenders involved in the deal between the city and the chamber charged the group with having defaulted on $5.7 million in principal and interest and accused it of ''misappropriating'' $50,000 a month in collected rents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Greater Harlem defended its performance, and ultimately a resolution was reached with the lender.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the troubles were multiplying. By 2000, Greater Harlem Housing owed the city more than $320,000 in overdue property taxes. It was eligible for a program that would have helped it limit its liabilities, but had never filed the paperwork.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2005, the lender again moved to foreclose on the chamber's holdings. Mr. Williams wrote in a court affidavit that Greater Harlem Housing was trying ''to restore itself to fiscal viability.'' He acknowledged ''the need for capital improvements and repairs'' but blamed rent-stabilization laws and delinquent tenants for the group's financial distress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A tenants' group saw things differently. It wrote to the judge complaining about ''years of mismanagement'' and ''the neglect and deplorable conditions'' of the buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Additionally, past history has proven'' the organization ''incapable of properly owning and managing these properties,'' the group said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In spring 2006 the city intervened to give Greater Harlem Housing another reprieve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Connections</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Williams has long been at the center of the Harlem Chamber of Commerce's expanding interests. He is president of the three nonprofit organizations run from the chamber's headquarters and an active player in Harlem politics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He runs a for-profit company, LMR Productions, which is based in the same offices as the chamber and shares key staff members. LMR bills the chamber's nonprofits for ''production'' and ''solicitation'' fees. Mr. Williams also had a brief experience as a partner in a for-profit enterprise to rehabilitate affordable apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It did not, though, go any better than the Greater Harlem Housing project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1992, the city sold eight buildings to Uptown Housing Partnership for a dollar each. Mr. Williams was an officer of the partnership, and problems emerged quickly there as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1996, a lender sued the partnership for having defaulted on $3.7 million in mortgages, and Mr. Williams and his partners lost the buildings in a 1999 foreclosure auction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">State and city investigators who began looking into Mr. Williams's dealings determined that he had used his oversight of another charity to misdirect public money into Greater Harlem Housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A federal investigation of Uptown Housing followed. No one was ever charged with a crime, but at the insistence of the city's Department of Investigation, Mr. Williams was removed from the board of the charity at the center of the inquiry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Calls to Mr. Williams were referred to Joseph Fleming, the lawyer for Greater Harlem Housing, who said that the difficulties with the apartments in the 13 buildings bought back in 1994 are only part of the picture, and cited the chamber's work bringing in new businesses and services to revive the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are a number of things that we've helped bring into the area that have really added some significant quality to the lifestyles that people live in the area,'' Mr. Fleming said. He mentioned a Quizno's, a Caribbean restaurant and a bank branch, among others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Crucial Endorsement</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Dickens, 61, joined the Council in 2006. She quickly gained the ear of Speaker Christine C. Quinn, who appointed Ms. Dickens to the leadership position of majority whip. Ms. Dickens took center stage when the Bloomberg administration's ambitious ideas for rezoning Harlem neared the final stages of the approval process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The administration, which had successfully rezoned vast parts of Brooklyn and Queens in its efforts to promote development, sought to create a new blueprint for a 24-block corridor on and around 125th Street that would revitalize the area with development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such rezoning plans need the approval of the City Council, and so hearings were scheduled and held. The Council has historically deferred to the decision of the local member in such matters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a Council subcommittee hearing on the rezoning on April 1, 2008, all eyes turned to Ms. Dickens. Her voice rose as she described herself as inspired by civil rights leaders in her ''fight'' with the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Over all, I've felt that the mayor's rezoning plan favored the developers and did encourage overdevelopment,'' she said. ''I said no. After long hours of discussion, they understand that I do mean no. And if I do not get the protections and community benefits that my community must have, there will be no rezoning plan signed into law.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Dickens, it turns out, had already been asking the Bloomberg administration for help with the Harlem chamber's various efforts. She was hardly unfamiliar with its principals and its work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her father, Lloyd E. Dickens, was a real estate developer and a state assemblyman who had served as the chamber's president before Mr. Williams. After she and her sister, Delores Richards, took over their father's real estate company, Ms. Dickens was listed as a member of the chamber's executive board, including after she joined the Council.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2004, the Dickens real estate firm served as a broker on a nearby project, Strivers Gardens, sponsored by the chamber, according to an article in New York Construction, a trade journal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Mr. Williams was one of two registered fund-raisers for Ms. Dickens's successful 2005 City Council campaign and, according to a newspaper report, was the master of ceremonies at her inauguration in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since joining the Council, Ms. Dickens has sent several pieces of city business to the chamber, including $75,000 to help minority- and women-owned businesses register for city contracts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her initial and public opposition to the administration's rezoning plan led to weeks of negotiations between Ms. Dickens and city officials. They proved successful, with the city agreeing to some of Ms. Dickens's demands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On April 30, 2008, Ms. Dickens endorsed the rezoning, and cleared the way for the full City Council to pass it. As she spoke, people who opposed the plan jeered her from the balconies, shouting ''sellout!'' and ''liar!''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I need no one to document my commitment to my community,'' Ms. Dickens said over shouts from the balcony. That day, the city housing agency gave Mr. Williams the news that it was finishing work on the $2.55 million forgivable loan the chamber had sought.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As part of the deal, the city once again modified Greater Harlem Housing's mortgage to let it catch up on nearly two years of payments totaling $110,860.62. The group had to pay $22,930.03 in cash; the rest of the arrears were added to the mortgage balance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May 2008, five days after the Council vote on the rezoning, Mr. Williams attended a fund-raiser for Ms. Dickens at Melba's restaurant in Harlem. The event yielded about $20,000, Ms. Dickens's biggest fund-raising day. Protesters gathered outside the restaurant yelled out again at Ms. Dickens as she left.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People felt so aggrieved that she was so transparently selling out their interests,'' said Michael Henry Adams, a Harlem historian, shortly after the fund-raiser.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Change of Heart</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Dickens has previously cited numerous reasons for supporting the rezoning, including that it would offer new affordable housing, safeguards against overdevelopment and protections for ''indigenous'' businesses and cultural institutions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bederman, the spokesman for the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, said the agency was aware of the earlier performance problems before the 2008 grant was approved, but noted the forgivable loan program had enough checks and balances that ''it works regardless of the prior history of the owner, which shouldn't be a barrier to the future of these tenants.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We were aware of the issues,'' Mr. Bederman said. ''We do recognize that these are serious concerns, and as such we have followed the necessary procedures for the project during this process and sought to ensure that the organization adhered to the structure of the program.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Providing the grant, he added, helped prevent a long and uncertain foreclosure process that would have likely caused the repairs to have gone undone even longer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the two years since that contentious vote in City Hall, Greater Harlem Housing has continued to founder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March, it filed a petition in State Supreme Court seeking permission to sell a large percentage of its interest in the properties to a private real estate developer, the Friedman Organization, for $1.5 million, a fraction of their appraised value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the petition, Mr. Williams said that Greater Harlem Housing had been ''unable to maintain the infrastructure and staff to provide property management.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group owed $100,000 to <span class="companylink">Consolidated Edison</span> and more than $800,000 to people who lent the group money to help it avoid losing the properties in the 2005 foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The petition also shows that a property appraiser hired by the group had determined that the properties should produce $700,000 in annual profit after expenses, something Greater Harlem Housing had not accomplished.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The terms of the 2008 grant from the city required that the repairs be completed and all outstanding code violations be resolved by June 3, 2010.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither condition has been met. Mr. Bederman, the city housing spokesman, blamed unforeseen delays. He said that the work was 70 percent completed, and that all the violations would be taken care of upon completion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Dickens has since allocated an additional $2 million of city funding for a second phase of rehabilitation, but that money has not yet been released.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHOENIX -- During the great housing boom, homeowners nationwide borrowed a trillion dollars from banks, using the soaring value of their houses as security. Now the money has been spent and struggling borrowers are unable or unwilling to pay it back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The delinquency rate on home equity loans is higher than all other types of consumer loans, including auto loans, boat loans, personal loans and even bank cards like Visa and <span class="companylink">MasterCard</span>, according to the American Bankers Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders say they are trying to recover some of that money but their success has been limited, in part because so many borrowers threaten bankruptcy and because the value of the homes, the collateral backing the loans, has often disappeared.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result is one of the paradoxes of the recession: the more money you borrowed, the less likely you will have to pay up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When houses were doubling in value, mom and pop making $80,000 a year were taking out $300,000 home equity loans for new cars and boats,'' said Christopher A. Combs, a real estate lawyer here, where the problem is especially pronounced. ''Their chances are pretty good of walking away and not having the bank collect.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lenders wrote off as uncollectible $11.1 billion in home equity loans and $19.9 billion in home equity lines of credit in 2009, more than they wrote off on primary mortgages, government data shows. So far this year, the trend is the same, with combined write-offs of $7.88 billion in the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even when a lender forces a borrower to settle through legal action, it can rarely extract more than 10 cents on the dollar. ''People got 90 cents for free,'' Mr. Combs said. ''It rewards immorality, to some extent.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Utah Loan Servicing is a debt collector that buys home equity loans from lenders. Clark Terry, the chief executive, says he does not pay more than $500 for a loan, regardless of how big it is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Anything over $15,000 to $20,000 is not collectible,'' Mr. Terry said. ''Americans seem to believe that anything they can get away with is O.K.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the borrowers argue that they are simply rebuilding their ravaged lives. Many also say that the banks were predatory, or at least indiscriminate, in making loans, and nevertheless were bailed out by the federal government. Finally, they point to their trump card: they say will declare bankruptcy if a settlement is not on favorable terms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I am not going to be a slave to the bank,'' said Shawn Schlegel, a real estate agent who is in default on a $94,873 home equity loan. His lender obtained a court order garnishing his wages, but that was 18 months ago. Mr. Schlegel, 38, has not heard from the lender since. ''The case is sitting stagnant,'' he said. ''Maybe it will just go away.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Schlegel's tale is similar to many others who got caught up in the boom: He came to Arizona in 2003 and quickly accumulated three houses and some land. Each deal financed the next. ''I was taught in real estate that you use your leverage to grow. I never dreamed the properties would go from $265,000 to $65,000.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apparently neither did one of his lenders, the <span class="companylink">Desert Schools Federal Credit Union</span>, which gave him a home equity loan secured by, the contract states, the ''security interest in your dwelling or other real property.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Desert Schools, the largest credit union in Arizona, increased its allowance for loan losses of all types by 926 percent in the last two years. It declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The amount of bad home equity loan business during the boom is incalculable and in retrospect inexplicable, housing experts say. Most of the debt is still on the books of the lenders, which include <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>, <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> and <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''No one had ever seen a national real estate bubble,'' said Keith Leggett, a senior economist with the American Bankers Association. ''We would love to change history so more conservative underwriting practices were put in place.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The delinquency rate on home equity loans was 4.12 percent in the first quarter, down slightly from the fourth quarter of 2009, when it was the highest in 26 years of such record keeping. Borrowers who default can expect damage to their creditworthiness and in some cases tax consequences.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, Mr. Leggett said, ''more than a sliver'' of the debt will never be repaid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eric Hairston plans to be among this group. During the boom, he bought as an investment a three-apartment property in Hoboken, N.J. At the peak, when the building was worth as much as $1.5 million, he took out a $190,000 home equity loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hairston, who worked in the technology department of the investment bank <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span>, invested in a Northern California pizza catering company. When real estate cratered, Mr. Hairston went into default.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building was sold this spring for $750,000. Only a small slice went to the home equity lender, which reserved the right to come after Mr. Hairston for the rest of what it was owed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hairston, who now works for the pizza company, has not heard again from his lender.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the lender made a bad loan, Mr. Hairston argues, a 10 percent settlement would be reasonable. ''It's not the homeowner's fault that the value of the collateral drops,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marc McCain, a Phoenix lawyer, has been retained by about 300 new clients in the last year, many of whom were planning to walk away from properties they could afford but wanted to be rid of -- strategic defaulters. On top of their unpaid mortgage obligations, they had home equity loans of $50,000 to $150,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fewer than 5 percent of these clients said they would continue paying their home equity loan no matter what. Ten percent intend to negotiate a short sale on their house, where the holders of the primary mortgage and the home equity loan agree to accept less than what they are owed. In such deals primary mortgage holders get paid first.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other 85 percent said they would default and worry about the debt only if and when they were forced to, Mr. McCain said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People want to have some green pastures in front of them,'' said Mr. McCain, who recently negotiated a couple's $75,000 home equity debt into a $3,500 settlement. ''It's come to the point where morality is no longer an issue.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Darin Bolton, a software engineer, defaulted on the loans for his house in a Chicago suburb last year because ''we felt we were just tossing our money into a hole.'' This spring, he moved into a rental a few blocks away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm kind of banking on there being too many of us for the lenders to pursue,'' he said. ''There is strength in numbers.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When construction loans grew scarce two years ago, property development along Manhattan's High Line, which had been fast and fierce, stumbled. One prominent project that still seemed to be moving along was a new branch of the Whitney Museum of American Art at the southern tip of the elevated park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While planning for that six-story museum at Washington and Gansevoort Streets is well under way, there are also signs that other development is picking up in this real estate submarket viewed as robust relative to some other Manhattan neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first part of the High Line, a landscaped city park created on abandoned elevated rail tracks that eventually is to stretch from Gansevoort Street to 34th Street, opened in June 2009, running north from Gansevoort to 20th Street. The second of three segments is expected to open in spring of 2011 and extend the High Line to 30th Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, among the dozens of projects planned along the length of the High Line, some have changed hands and a few were sold by banks after developers defaulted, but most are still on track for development. Some developers are waiting for construction loans to become available, and other longtime property owners are just waiting for the right moment to move forward, but all agree that a submarket has been created, the strength of which could not have been envisioned just five years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate owners along the first High Line segment, a large chunk of which spans the meatpacking district, said they were already starting to feel the park's positive effects on real estate values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For those who thought that area was a flash in the pan, something that already happened, they're going to be pleasantly surprised with the next dimensions of the change in that neighborhood,'' said Joseph J. Sitt, the chief executive of Thor Equities, a real estate development company that owns 446 West 14th Street, which connects directly to the High Line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sitt said Thor was rebuilding 446 West 14th Street and would install a women's clothing boutique, called Kritzia, by the fall, as well as a restaurant and a club lounge with a possible rooftop space by the spring of 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hampshire Real Estate Companies of Morristown, N.J., has owned a warehouse at 259 10th Avenue between 25th and 26th Streets for many years. The company is prepared to overhaul the interior of the hulking structure, which was designed by the architect Cass Gilbert, but is waiting for the right tenant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It couldn't be better located,'' said A. Eugene Kohn, chairman of <span class="companylink">Kohn Pedersen Fox</span> Associates, the architecture firm hired to retrofit the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other longtime property owners were poised to develop when the recession hit. Edison Properties of Newark had planned two towers with 869 condominium apartments on a block west of the High Line between 17th and 18th Streets. The land is still a parking lot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, Edison executives are biding their time as they prepare to clean up the soil on the property, which they have owned more than 20 years. Edison will also assist the city in creating a public park east of the High Line to 10th Avenue between 17th and 18th Streets, ''like the Spanish Steps'' in Rome, said Ken Miller, an Edison executive vice president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Developers who have owned their properties for less time, perhaps even those that bought at the top of the boom, may not have the luxury of waiting out the market. Citibank has been trying to sell a slightly cantilevered shiny metal-skinned condominium building at 245 10th Avenue and 25th Street, said Erik Ekstein, the owner of Ekstein Development, who said he was asked if he wanted to take over the project. He declined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ekstein is developing a 91-unit condominium building at 540 West 28th Street and a 30-unit rental building at 537 West 27th Street, midway between the High Line and 11th Avenue, along with L&amp;M Development Partners, a firm based in Westchester County that typically develops low- and moderate-priced housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The projects will not be built as affordable housing, because two years ago, L&amp;M couldn't buy enough development rights from landowners immediately beneath the High Line to make moderate-priced units feasible, said Ron Moelis, a principal with L&amp;M.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People were valuing those development rights so high, they priced themselves out of the market,'' Mr. Moelis said. Since the economic downturn, ''there are maybe some people who need some money or liquidity, so more development rights have come on the market the past year or so,'' a boon to property developers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some developers have been able to exploit distressed situations. <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span> of Chicago announced at an earnings meeting earlier this year that it was leasing a parcel at 23rd Street and 10th Avenue, where the previous developer had poured a foundation before running into financial trouble. Equity plans to build 111 apartments and 9,400 square feet of retail space, and construction has already started.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another parcel at 500 West 21st Street and 10th Avenue changed hands in May after its owners group, including the developers Charles Blaichman and Andre Balazs, defaulted on the loan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sherwood Equities, a real estate development and investment firm based in New York, picked up the property, which has a 19,000-square-foot garage on it, for a fraction of the $50 million the original owners paid in 2007, said Ryan Nelson, a Sherwood senior vice president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July, Sherwood leased the site to a garage operator. Later, when construction financing and loans for homebuyers become easier to obtain, the development company could build 100,000 square feet of residential, hotel, office or retail space, said Jeffrey Katz, Sherwood's chief executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Right now, there's still difficulties to developing in New York,'' he said. ''The market's not exactly robust.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A hotel planned for 511 West 21st Street, abutting the High Line, with backers who included Mr. Blaichman and the rap musician Jay-Z, has been reported to be another casualty of the economic downtown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another property on the market is 508 West 20th Street, which abuts the High Line on the west side. No buyer has yet stepped up to pay the $9 million asking price for the 3,800-square-foot lot, a broker at Zohar Properties said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the height of the market, the price of properties next to the High Line may have soared as high as $400 a buildable square foot, but current prices are roughly $200 a buildable square foot, said Paul Pariser, a co-chief executive of a commercial property owner, <span class="companylink">Taconic Investment Partners</span>, based in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2008, Taconic, along with the Related Companies, one of the city's most prolific developers, opened the first condominium building with access to the High Line. Now, Taconic has almost completed 15 Little West 12th Street, an 80,000-square-foot office building with retail space east of the High Line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taconic is also poised to develop another office building at 837 Washington Street at 13th Street, also east of the High Line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The High Line has been a very positive influence to push activities to Washington, which was sort of a back street, but now it's become very prime,'' Mr. Pariser said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Pariser said a new office building, the High Line Building at 450 West 14th Street, which is still being completed, has been quickly attracting tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A gas station at the corner of 10th Avenue and 14th Street, abutting the High Line, is available for lease, said Karen Bellantoni, an executive vice president with Robert K. Futterman &amp;Associates, a retail real estate brokerage firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said that future development along the High Line north of 18th Street would be mostly residential.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My understanding is that there are a few things in play, but right now, everyone's sort of waiting to see,'' Ms. Bellantoni said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Related Companies -- which also won the contract to develop the Hudson Yards area -- has, as yet, no timeline for development of lots it has assembled both east and west of the High Line from 29th to 30th Streets, which eventually could become residential, hotel, office, retail or a mix of the four, said Bruce Beal Jr., an executive vice president with Related.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The development of the High Line so far has created a very strong submarket,'' Mr. Beal said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: August 17, 2010, Tuesday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article in the Square Feet pages on Wednesday about new development along the High Line in Manhattan misstated the status of an apartment building at 23rd Street and 10th Avenue planned by <span class="companylink">Equity Residential</span>.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In real estate, as in life, timing is everything.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two of New York's largest real estate brokerage firms, Cushman &amp;Wakefield and <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>, have negotiated new leases for their Manhattan offices, and one seemed to get better terms than the other. The deals were struck 19 months apart, long enough to produce distinct changes in the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cushman consolidated its three Midtown locations into a new building at 1290 Avenue of the Americas between 51st and 52nd Streets, and CBRE opted to remain where it was, in the MetLife Building, at 200 Park Avenue. Although both firms seem to have obtained favorable lease terms, CBRE, which signed its lease in December 2009, appears to have gotten a better deal than Cushman, which negotiated its lease in May 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cushman's new 175,000-square-foot offices, home of its world headquarters, represent both a consolidation and downsizing from its three previous Midtown locations. Before the move, it occupied 175,000 square feet at 51 West 52nd Street, 40,000 square feet at 1350 Avenue of the Americas, and 13,000 square feet at 712 Fifth Avenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An industry executive familiar with the terms of Cushman's new 15-year lease with <span class="companylink">Vornado Realty Trust</span>, owner of 1290 Avenue of the Americas, said it included an average rent of about $88 a square foot, some nine months of free rent and a tenant improvement allowance of approximately $55 a square foot. When Cushman moved into the building -- it occupies the entire seventh floor and parts of the eighth and ninth floors -- it also became the building's exclusive leasing agent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cushman's ability to serve as the agent of its new building could be significant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The types of tenants at 1290 could be meaningful; they are generally big-space users,'' said Lawrence J. Longua, clinical associate professor at the Schack Institute of Real Estate at New York University. ''When those leases roll, there's a lot of money to be made for the building agent,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Cassidy Turley, a commercial real estate company, when Cushman signed its lease with Vornado in May 2008, the average asking rent for a Class A office building in the Rockefeller Center submarket was $108.14 a square foot, far more than Cushman paid. Last month this fell to a four-year low of $71.32.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A spokesman for Cushman declined to confirm terms of the lease, but said its ''net effective rent, including landlord contributions toward construction and free rent, was better than market for comparable space at the time we completed the lease. Rent was only one of the many considerations we had.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CBRE's new 15-year lease in the MetLife Building, which is directly north of Grand Central Station and owned by Tishman Speyer Properties, will begin in June 2011. CBRE will occupy 125,771 square feet on the 19th, 20th, 21st and 22nd floors; it currently occupies approximately the same amount of space on floors 17 through 19.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Industry executives familiar with CBRE's new lease said it included an average rent of about $70 a square foot, approximately nine months of free rent and a tenant improvement allowance of about $55 a square foot. CBRE declined to comment on these terms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Grand Central submarket, Cassidy Turley said the average asking rent for a Class A office building in December 2009, when CBRE signed its lease with Tishman Speyer, was $61.17 a square foot. This fell to $58.35 in April 2010, the lowest it had been since December 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joseph Harbert, chief operating officer of Cushman &amp;Wakefield's New York metro region, said the company began considering its office space options in early 2007. Although Cushman had a clause in its lease at 51 West 52nd Street that would have allowed it to stay in the building for an additional five years at a fair market-value rent -- then about $100 a square foot -- he said the firm determined ''that to stay where we were at a very high rent would not let us achieve our objectives.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was a tight market, and we narrowed our search down to three or four spaces that were reasonably close to what we wanted to achieve,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Harbert said Cushman signed its lease ''when the market was vibrant,'' with ''high pricing and lack of availability. We signed in an up market. You sign when you have to sign.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mitchell E. Rudin, chief executive of the New York tristate region of CBRE, which occupies the company's <span class="companylink">MetLife</span> offices, said CBRE began its search in the summer of 2008. Although its preference was to remain in the MetLife Building, ''the economy was such that we wouldn't have been able to stay here,'' he said. ''But as we embarked on the process, the market started to deteriorate and it appeared as a more likely alternative.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rudin said CBRE considered ''quite a number of buildings,'' looked at three, and began lease negotiations with Tishman Speyer in the summer of 2009. ''I believe we signed this at absolutely the optimum time,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cushman's new open offices, designed by <span class="companylink">Mancini Duffy</span>, contain clusters of work stations, glass-walled offices along the perimeter of the floor, and only two corner offices, for its global and Americas chief executives. The offices contain 47,500 square feet of conference rooms and meeting space and two landscaped terraces. Building out the new offices cost about $185 a square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still being designed by the architectural design firm Gensler, CBRE's new offices also will be more open than before, but the company will retain corner offices for some senior executives. The centerpiece of the new space will be the new 21st floor, with the main reception area, meeting rooms, a dining room and terrace. Mr. Rudin declined to disclose the company's build-out cost.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Milstein, who used profits from the family flooring business to build a real estate empire in New York City, distinguished by major projects begun in uncertain neighborhoods and totaling 50,000 apartments, 8,000 hotel rooms and 20 million square feet of office space, died on Monday at his Manhattan home. He was 88.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His son Howard announced the death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Milstein brought a boisterous personality to a rough-and-tumble game, but much of his success came from a shrewdness in recognizing opportunities. His projects included three of the first luxury buildings near the new Lincoln Center, a luxury tower on the fringe of Harlem and some of the first buildings in Battery Park City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His purchase of the boarded-up Royal Manhattan Hotel in 1978 and re-imagining of it as the Milford Plaza is often seen as the beginning of Times Square's comeback. Community Board 5 called the project ''courageous.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New York publication Real Estate Weekly said in 2005 that many Milstein projects had anchored and revived ''ailing neighborhoods'' and lauded Mr. Milstein for identifying those areas ''long before most others.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Milsteins, along with the likes of the Lefraks, Roses, Dursts and Helmsleys, have been among the leading families in New York real estate. Bill Rudin, whose father, Lewis, helped build another family real estate empire, said of Mr. Milstein on Monday, ''He's already probably up in heaven playing Monopoly with my father, Harry Helmsley and some of the other icons of our city and industry.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Milstein's own story was the stuff of novels, maybe operas. His father, Morris, emigrated from Russia and started a business refinishing floors, and Paul learned the trade as a teenager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the early 1960s, he decided his future was in building, and with his older brother, Seymour, he built Dorchester Towers on 68th Street between Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue. Seymour died in 2001.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For decades, the brothers met daily for lunch in the Rainbow Room, kissing each other as they parted. They were a powerful team: Seymour was the diplomat who charmed bankers; Paul was the two-fisted builder who spoke plainly in a deep, froggy voice with a Bronx accent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We live in a jungle,'' Paul Milstein said in an interview with The New York Times in 1981. ''In order to survive in a jungle, I guess you've got to be tougher to be a winner. My competitors, my adversaries and my friends really can't say, 'I'm tough.' They don't understand the word tough.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toughness may have become brazenness when Mr. Milstein bought the famed Biltmore Hotel on Madison Avenue to turn it into the New York headquarters of the <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> in 1981. After promising to restore the hotel's famed Palm Court lobby -- where generations had met ''under the clock'' -- he stripped it bare. (He left the clock.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Milstein later gave $500,000 to the preservation group that had planned to oversee the restoration, the New York Landmarks Conservancy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Milstein brothers took over companies, then sold them at a profit. One they kept was Emigrant Savings Bank, which they bought in 1986 and turned into the nation's largest privately owned bank. Together and individually, they distributed many millions of dollars to hospitals, universities and other causes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then came a fraternal split.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It began with divergent views on the future of the brothers' empire. Seymour wanted to sell the family businesses, while Paul wanted to divide them. At its heart, the issue was how the family would move into its third generation of business leadership, and the aspersions each man cast on the other's son were harsh. At least four lawsuits were filed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a letter to shareholders, Paul said Seymour's son, Philip, president of the bank, was ''dictatorial'' and lacked ''critical thinking.'' Seymour responded by saying that Paul's son Howard made ''unilateral'' decisions, ignoring the family's ''collegial, consensual'' tradition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul's anger flared in a 2001 letter to Seymour: ''I have made you and your children rich in the real estate and banking business, and you should all be ashamed of yourselves.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two years later, the two sides divided everything in a sealed agreement and refused to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Milstein was born in Manhattan on May 12, 1922 and raised in the South Bronx, where he worked at his father's Circle Floor Company. He attended New York University for two years and spent World War II in the Army Signal Corps in Missouri.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the war he rose to president of the flooring company, which flourished in the 1950s installing floors in some of New York's best-known landmarks, including Rockefeller Center and the United Nations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seymour, meanwhile, led the family's vinyl floor tile firm. In 1959 it was sold to Ruberoid, a building products company, for $24 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Milsteins soon fought to take over the company that bought Ruberoid. They lost, but they became agile wheeler-dealers, maneuvering for board seats and management leverage in a string of companies, among them the National Kinney Corporation, the Uris Building Corporation, the <span class="companylink">Starrett Corporation</span> and United Brands, which was known for selling bananas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At United Brands, the Milsteins increased profits to their highest level since the company was created in a merger in 1970. Paul, who liked to offer guests one of his prized cigars, had a standard greeting, ''A banana and a Havana?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul kept building. His projects included the Normandie Court on East 95th Street, Windsor Court in Murray Hill, the Liberty buildings in Battery Park City and others from Chicago to Iran.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even when he stumbled, as in his long struggle to be named one of the principal developers of Times Square, Mr. Milstein won plaudits for pure grit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Milstein's consolation prize in the Times Square project was not insignificant. In 1984, the family bought a parking lot on the southeast corner of 42nd Street and Eighth Avenue for $5 million. In the division of assets resulting from the family brouhaha, Paul paid $111 million to his brother and other partners in 2001. Five years later, he sold the parcel for $325 million. (A new 40-story tower now rises from the site.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Milstein's philanthropy, much of it done with his brother, was immense. Gifts included the Milstein Hall of Ocean Life (''The Whale Room'') at the American Museum of Natural History; the building housing the architecture department at Cornell; an endowed professorship at Columbia; and the terrace and pool at Lincoln Center. His medical philanthropy included the Milstein Hospital Building of NewYork Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Milstein is survived by his wife, the former Irma Cameron; his sons Howard and Edward; his daughters Roslyn Milstein Meyer and Barbara Susan Milstein Zalaznick; his sister, Gloria Flanzer; 11 grandchildren; and one great-grandchild.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The brothers never reconciled. But when Seymour died, Paul bought an ad in The Times reading, ''We will always cherish the happy times we shared and the many years together.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: August 12, 2010, Thursday</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village, the sprawling Manhattan apartment complexes headed for foreclosure after a record-setting $5.4 billion sale in 2006, still have an allure for some developers, investors and speculators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A partnership of <span class="companylink">Winthrop Realty Trust</span> and <span class="companylink">Pershing Square Capital</span> moved on Monday to get control of the 80-acre property, which has 11,226 apartments in 110 red-brick buildings overlooking the East River. The partners say their strategy is to convert the rental apartments at Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village into an ''affordable cooperative'' and reap a windfall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the bondholders who have a $3 billion first mortgage on the property may oppose Winthrop and Pershing's attempt to take control based on their relatively small $45 million investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, several other entities, including Colony Capital, Westwood Capital and two of the city's major real estate families -- the LeFraks and the Dursts -- have expressed interest in buying the complexes, according to real estate executives familiar with the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the tenant association has been trying to put together a deal for the buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever the outcome, it is clear that Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village, which have formed a rare middle-class enclave in Manhattan for more than 60 years, have not been stigmatized by the collapse of what was once hailed as the biggest real estate deal in history for a single property. The partnership that bought the two complexes for $5.4 billion defaulted in January on a $3 billion first mortgage and $1.4 billion in secondary loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Despite the turbulence surrounding this property in recent years,'' Ben Thypin, a senior analyst at <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>, said, ''Stuyvesant Town remains an irreplaceable asset that many deep-pocketed players will be interested in.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Winthrop and Pershing Square say that they want to work closely with elected officials and the 25,000 tenants at the two complexes, which sit between 14th and 23rd Streets east of First Avenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The unique circumstances of Stuyvesant Town today create the opportunity for us to make an attractive investment, for tenants to buy their apartments at below-market prices and for the first-mortgage lender to get back its money,'' said William A. Ackman, chief executive of <span class="companylink">Pershing Square Capital Management</span>. ''We're excited about that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But their plan is not dissimilar from what is being considered by Westwood Capital or the Dursts. And the tenant association did not immediately embrace the move by Mr. Ackman and his partners. City Councilman Daniel R. Garodnick, a lifelong resident of Peter Cooper, said he expected many twists and turns before the fate of the complexes was resolved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''No entity can be successful without the cooperation and support of the tenants,'' Mr. Garodnick said on Monday. ''We'll be interested in learning about their motivation and priorities. The long-term affordability of this property is important.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tenants have tangled with the current owners, a partnership of Tishman Speyer Properties and BlackRock Realty, over their plans for the complexes. The owners challenged the rights of hundreds of longtime tenants to live there. Although rents covered only about a third of the debt service on a $3 billion first mortgage, the owners had hoped to profit by converting rent-stabilized apartments to market rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More recently, the tenant association has also been working on a plan to convert Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village to a co-op. Tenants could continue renting or could buy their units, with special restrictions on resales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You need to allow the next generation to enjoy what current and past tenants have enjoyed for years,'' Mr. Garodnick said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carolyn B. Tiffany, president of Winthrop, said that the objective of Pershing and her company ''is to do exactly what the tenant association wanted done.'' But their idea of what is ''affordable'' may differ sharply with the tenants' views.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Winthrop has a $25 million slice of $1.4 billion in secondary loans on the property. In recent weeks, Winthrop and Pershing bought the $300 million senior segment of those loans for $45 million or 15 cents on the dollar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discount was so steep because the estimated value of the property is now about $1.8 billion, far less than the $4.4 billion in first and second mortgages. Presumably, there is nothing left to pay off the secondary loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Winthrop and Pershing say that the discount enables them to pay off the $3 billion first mortgage, sell apartments to tenants at below-market prices and make a tidy profit. They filed notice on Monday in State Supreme Court that they planned to foreclose on their $300 million loan and gain control of the property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it is unclear whether they can legally foreclose without satisfying the first mortgage. CW Capital, which represents the trust that owns the first mortgage, has told interested buyers that it had planned to foreclose on it in September and that it would consider sometime next year whether to sell the property.</p>

</div><div class="author">By TOM HUNDLEY </div><div>1332 words</div><div>8 August 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>National Edition</div><div>21A</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With apologies to the fictional town of Lake Wobegon, the real-life Chicago suburb of Lake Forest is a place where it sometimes seems that all the women drive S.U.V.'s, all the men are C.E.O.'s and all the children have above-average S.A.T.'s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The per-capita income for Lake Forest residents is $77,000. There is a road named Rockefeller. And if you are fortunate enough to live within this leafy redoubt of old wealth and new, the rest of the world and its troubles can seem very far removed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the national tidal wave of foreclosures that has swamped large parts of the metropolitan area's housing market, mainly in low-income neighborhoods, is now starting to lap at the unspoiled shores of this community on Lake Michigan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In the first half of 2010, the largest increases in new foreclosures occurred in the region's middle- and higher-income communities,'' according to a report this month by the Woodstock Institute, which tracks housing trends in the region.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DuPage County was hardest hit in the Chicago metropolitan area, with a 74.8 percent increase in new filings in the first six months of 2010; Lake County, home to Lake Forest, was second, with a 64.9 percent jump. But in Lake Forest, the increase in the number of foreclosures was a jarring 78.9 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An examination of real estate transactions in Lake Forest through the end of July found that of the 127 houses sold this year, 18 of them, or 14 percent, were either in foreclosure or were transferred on so-called short sales -- that is, when the selling price falls short of the amount owed on the mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is happening in Lake Forest is part of a larger trend, said Geoff Smith, the vice president of Woodstock Institute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The numbers are tapering off in the low- to moderate-income communities because these foreclosures were mainly driven by subprime loans, which for the most part have been cycled through the system,'' Mr. Smith said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the crisis is scything through the region's middle- and high-income communities, where most of the foreclosures are tied to prime loans made in the last two to three years, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the subprime debacle was triggered mainly by lenders offering gimmicky mortgages to poor people who could not afford them, this new phase of the crisis is the result of more mundane economic factors: a lingering recession, high unemployment and a weak housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The majority of the foreclosures still involve single-family homes, but condominiums are beginning to make up a larger share of the filings. In north and northwest Cook County, condominiums now represent 30 percent and 44 percent, respectively, of the new foreclosures -- a jump of 76 percent over last year, according to the Woodstock Institute's data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one northwest Cook County community -- unidentified in the report -- there were 98 foreclosure filings from a single development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The numbers in Lake Forest are comparatively small -- 34 foreclosures this year compared with 11,103 in Chicago, according to the institute's tally -- but the impact has been especially nerve-racking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two years ago, the words ''foreclosure'' and ''short sale'' did not exist in the local real estate lexicon, said Dick Christoph Jr., a Realtor with Coldwell Banker in Lake Forest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Available records indicate that the average asking price for foreclosed houses in Lake Forest in the first six months of this year was $860,000. There were more foreclosed properties valued at more than $1 million than there were under $500,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">How did this come to pass in Lake Forest, where people are not only wealthy, but also like to think of themselves as wise in the ways of money?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The culprits, real estate experts say, are interest-only and no-down-payment loans, which were popular with high earners who saw the housing bubble as a way to enhance their wealth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the mid-1990s until the bubble burst two years ago, it was virtually impossible to lose money in real estate in Lake Forest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You'd ask someone how they were doing, and they'd say, 'Oh, I made $100,000, $200,000 this year, but my house went up $200,000,' '' Mr. Christoph said. ''So they started spending like they were earning $400,000 a year. In reality, they were living above their means.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When housing prices tumbled, these homeowners found themselves under water: the market value of their property was less than the mortgage and any other outstanding loans. And the high end of the market seems to have been hit hardest of all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've seen a remarkable drop in large-home prices,'' said David Moore, a businessman who serves on the Lake Forest City Council. ''Homes on the water that used to go for $10 million or $11 million -- it's being whispered that you can get them now for $4 million or $5 million.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Moore said there was a stir last week when the Noble Judah house, considered by some city residents to be the finest property in town, was put on the market as a short sale for $5.99 million. A few years ago, the 85-year-old manor would have commanded three times as much, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No statistics are available, but experts say a significant number of high-end foreclosures and short sales seem to be ''strategic walk-aways'' or what some have dubbed ''ruthless defaults.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It does appear that some of these owners may be doing it for strategic reasons, as a way to handle their assets,'' said Stuart M. Widman, a Chicago lawyer and member of the Lake Forest City Council. ''It's not the way I would handle things.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some real estate agents, including Mr. Christoph, are advising underwater sellers to consider a walk-away. ''The banks will hate me for saying this,'' Mr. Christoph said, ''but if you can't ride it out and you're going to be caught in a short sale, quite frankly it makes sense to stop paying the mortgage.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of people just got caught up in this thing,'' he added. ''They're not bad people; it's not a deadbeat scenario. You have to protect yourself and move on.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While banks might not be happy with Mr. Christoph's advice, they do seem to take a different approach to these high-end defaults, or as F. Scott Fitzgerald -- whose Daisy Buchanan character was inspired by a Lake Forest debutante -- observed, the very rich ''are different from you and me.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Defaulters in wealthy communities are not likely to be faced with eviction by the sheriff. Banks will generally allow these owners to stay in the house as long as they continue to maintain it. Derelict houses with overgrown lawns, the fallout of the foreclosure crisis in many down-and-out urban neighborhoods, are a rarity in Lake Forest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even as they work to keep up appearances, residents of Lake Forest and other upscale suburbs will probably be under increasing financial pressure for as long as the recession continues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'd like to tell you we are bottoming out and that things will start to improve,'' Mr. Christoph said, ''but I think we are going to see a lot more of these larger-priced homes go into foreclosure before we're through with this.''</p>

</div><div class="author">By SAM DOLNICK and CHARLES V. BAGLI </div><div>1608 words</div><div>6 August 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>16</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Bronx portfolio,'' the Web posting read. ''These distressed properties fetches prices that are much below its market value.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The grammatically sloppy advertisement for 10 troubled buildings in the Bronx appeared this spring on <span class="companylink">eBay</span> classifieds, not a forum known for attracting the kinds of investors who can afford to rescue the properties, which are plagued with crumbling ceilings, roaches and unsustainable debt piled on during the speculative boom of the previous decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But with scores of such buildings in foreclosure and many others in disrepair, city officials and housing advocates say a new wave of investors has already begun to swoop in. And the actions of some of the new buyers -- one was recently jailed for contempt of court, another has already clashed with tenants -- have raised fears that conditions in timeworn buildings could get even worse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rafael E. Cestero, the commissioner of the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, said he had seen a number of distressed properties around the city sold to buyers who were not acting ''in the best interests of the city, the neighborhood or tenants.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cestero said that city officials, seeking ways to intervene, had little recourse, since most of the deals were private. ''This is probably the most difficult thing we're doing at H.P.D. right now,'' he said. ''We don't have a clear and obvious way to insert ourselves.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the buyers are often paying less than the previous owners did, tenant advocates maintain that some of the prices are still too high for the amount of rental income the buildings generate and the repairs they need.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So the new owners, the advocates say, have already revived old tactics of tenant harassment, including bringing trumped-up lawsuits against tenants in rent-regulated apartments, hoping to evict them and then raise the rents under the state's so-called vacancy decontrol rules.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One landlord, Meyer Orbach, paid $70 million in June 2008 for 13 buildings with 250 apartments on West 49th Street; about half of the apartments were rent regulated. Last year, he bought 22 buildings with 384 apartments on West 109th Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latter portfolio cost $45 million, or about 60 percent of what was owed by the previous owners, the Pinnacle and the Praedium Group, which had begun eviction proceedings against 5,000 of the 21,000 tenants it had in New York City. Mr. Orbach's strategy, many tenants say, is no different. He has filed dozens of cases against tenants in housing court, and some tenants complain that private investigators posing as repairmen have been poking around their apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rosa Hernandez, 71, said she and her husband have lived in their two-bedroom fifth-floor apartment at 204 West 109th Street for 32 years. They raised four children in the apartment, where they pay $563 a month in rent. Mr. Orbach's lawyers say in court papers that she now lives in her native country, Ecuador, and in Florida, where some of her children now live; she denies the claim.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bennett Baumer, a tenant organizer at Housing Conservation Coordinators who is working with tenants on 49th Street, said of Mr. Orbach, ''He's part of a second wave of predatory investors using vacancy decontrol to evict tenants and jack up rents at the expense of affordable housing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Orbach's lawyer, Ken Fisher, rejected that notion, calling Mr. Orbach a ''small potatoes'' investor, not a Wall Street speculator. He said Mr. Orbach was merely trying to get rid of tenants who had no right to rent-regulated apartments, because they were illegally subletting or had a primary residence elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is an unfortunate fact,'' Mr. Fisher said, ''that tenants in New York sometimes resort to illegal tactics in order to hold on to rent-regulated apartments.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One tenant currently in court with Mr. Orbach is Felipe Fernandez, who said he has lived in his family's four-bedroom apartment on West 109th Street since 1974. His parents have since left the neighborhood but he remains, the sole occupant, with an $800-a-month rent. Given the apartment's four bedrooms, it is easy to see why a landlord would want to remove him. But, Mr. Fernandez said, that does not give Mr. Orbach the right to toss him out of his home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I grew up around here,'' said Mr. Fernandez, 50. ''I know the neighborhood and everybody knows me. My daughter went to the school down the street.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Orbach's lawyer said his firm's investigation had indicated that Mr. Fernandez lived somewhere else most of the time; Mr. Fernandez denied that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">City officials said they were keeping an eye on Mr. Orbach's buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although he initially rebuffed their efforts, the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, credited Mr. Orbach for evicting an illegal hotel that had been operating in one of his buildings. But, she said, ''I still have concerns about whether there is or was harassment going on.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The downturn in the housing market foiled many plans to gentrify buildings in far-flung neighborhoods. Many new landlords were stuck paying mortgages that the buildings' rent rolls could not support, and some walked away from the buildings, while tenants languished in apartments badly in need of maintenance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The real culprits,'' said Dina Levy of the Urban Homesteading Assistance Board, a tenant advocacy group, ''are the banks who, eyes wide open, overleveraged these buildings when they should have known better.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there is still interest among investors for rent-regulated buildings, said Robert A. Knakal, a principal at Massey Knakal, the real estate broker that sold Mr. Orbach the 109th Street buildings. ''The artificially low rents lead to a lot of upside,'' he said. ''If they're paying below-market rents, it's a positive thing if the tenant leaves.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many tenants in rent-regulated apartments, he said, are ''abusing the system.'' Legitimate tenants, he said, have nothing to worry about because they cannot be legally displaced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tenant advocates have had some success. Last year, the city helped broker a deal that allowed the former baseball star Mo Vaughn and his real estate company, the Omni Group, which has had success turning around neglected properties, to take over and begin to fix 14 of the city's most troubled buildings that had been owned by the Ocelot Capital Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But rather than serve as a model, the Omni deal has started to look like an exception. City officials have so far not had success replicating the arrangement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One real estate manager, Sam Suzuki, represented a group that bought six other Ocelot buildings in May 2009, raising hopes that conditions would improve. They did not. The number of violations grew under Mr. Suzuki's watch, and the tenant group of a building at 1585 East 172nd Street filed suit against him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Suzuki failed to correct violations, show up in court or reveal the names of the owners of the properties, and this summer he served three weeks in jail for civil contempt, a rare penalty in housing court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Suzuki, in an interview on Thursday, blamed the buildings' problems on tenants who failed to pay the rent. ''There has to be a balance with the landlord and the tenant,'' he said. ''The tenants have to pay the rent.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A real estate investment company, the Bluestone Group, bought the debt on Mr. Suzuki's buildings from <span class="companylink">Dime Savings Bank</span>, making it, in effect, the third time the troubled housing stock changed hands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eli Tabak, a principal in the company, said the deal was in line with Bluestone's business model, which he said involved ''buying distressed debt at a discount, turning the asset around and turning it into a cash-flowing proposition.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ten buildings owned by Milbank Real Estate, a Los Angeles company, went into foreclosure last year -- and showed up on the <span class="companylink">eBay</span> classifieds with the name of a Yonkers real estate company on March 30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing advocates said these listings on <span class="companylink">eBay</span>, where sellers may list items but do not put them up for auction, represented a new low, signaling levels of desperation that spelled only more pain for the tenants. The buildings that were owned by Milbank have 547 apartments and more than 3,200 housing code violations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Milbank did not return calls for comment. A new buyer is currently negotiating to take over the portfolio, said Jen Brown, a spokeswoman for LNR Property, the special servicer handling the troubled loan. LNR has declined to disclose the name of the buyer, drawing concerns from Ms. Quinn, whose office has reviewed the portfolio's finances and fears the new owners are ill-prepared to repair and maintain the buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Quinn took part in a rally on Tuesday in front of one of the Bronx buildings calling for more transparency and accountability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We believe that this sale is just going to rearrange the deck chairs on the Titanic,'' Ms. Quinn said in an interview. ''I'm very concerned that this is deja vu all over again.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A THREE-BEDROOM COUNTRY HOUSE WITH A GUEST COTTAGE AND TURKISH BATH IN COUNTY WICKLOW, IRELAND</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">2 MILLION EUROS ($2.6 MILLION)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This cluster of stone buildings, dating back to the 18th century, is set on eight acres. In the main house, a glass-roofed conservatory runs from the front door to the back, connecting the house's two wings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one wing are the common areas, including a kitchen with handmade wood cabinets, pink marble countertops and a pantry and an Aga stove, a popular British oven made of iron and enamel. Off the kitchen is a terrace. The living room has a stone fireplace, arched windows on three sides, and French doors that open up to the garden. There is also an informal den and a library.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bedrooms are in the other wing of the house, two of which have en suite bathrooms. Throughout the home are several skylights.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the buildings is set up as a Turkish bath house, with a steam room and exercise area on the ground floor, and a bedroom with an en suite bathroom upstairs. A third house on the property is a self-contained unit, with a living room, kitchen, two bedrooms and a bathroom. In addition, there is a swimming pool, a tennis court and extensive gardens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house sits on a hillside overlooking the valley of Glendalough. According to the listing agent, the poet William Butler Yeats wrote his poem, ''Stream and Sun at Glendalough'' while visiting the house. The surrounding area is popular for its walking trails and lakes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The village of Laragh, a mile away, has a gourmet market and a hotel. There are pubs and shops five miles away in Roundwood. The nearest beach is a 25-minute drive. Dublin is an hour's drive; Dublin airport is an hour and 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARKET OVERVIEW</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices in the Irish property market are down 40 to 45 percent from the peak of the market in 2007, said David Duffy, an economist at the Dublin-based Economic and Social Research Institute. High unemployment and reduced wages have suppressed recovery. ''We don't know whether the market has bottomed out yet or not,'' Mr. Duffy said, estimating that the market may drop another 5 to 10 percent before it starts to recover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Harriet Grant, a real estate agent with <span class="companylink">Knight Frank</span>'s Dublin office, ''Prices have come down 50 percent for country houses,'' since the market peaked, she said. ''There's very little property for sale because people are holding onto it,'' waiting for the market to rise again, she added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a report by <span class="companylink">permanent tsb</span>, an Irish bank, residential real estate in Ireland cost an average of 144 euros per square foot ($190 per square foot at $1.32 to the euro) in the second quarter of 2010, according to Mr. Duffy, who collaborates with <span class="companylink">permanent tsb</span> on a quarterly real estate report. Prices in Dublin are higher, averaging 192 euros per square foot during the same period, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Privacy laws in Ireland restrict the public's access to sales prices, according to Paul Murgatroyd, an independent economist who consults with the property search portal, MyHome.ie. He said this can make it difficult for buyers to compare a home's asking price to its actual market value. Average prices for country homes, such as the one featured here, are not readily available. This property is 400 euros per square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHO BUYS IN COUNTY WICKLOW</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retirees from the Netherlands, Germany, and Britain are the most common foreign buyers in Ireland. Mr. Duffy said they tend to prefer the west coast, which has a reputation for natural beauty and outdoor recreation. Second homes on Ireland's east coast are mostly in County Wicklow and County Wexford. ''There are not a lot of Americans,'' Mr. Duffy said, although Ms. Grant said County Wicklow has seen some Canadian buyers in recent years. ''Wicklow is known as the garden of Ireland,'' she said. ''Lots of people from Dublin go down there for the summer.'' The county also attracts film stars and other performers, Ms. Grant said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BUYING BASICS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are no restrictions on foreigners wishing to buy property in Ireland.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers must pay a stamp duty when property changes hands. The stamp duty varies depending on the sales price. Ms. Grant said the first 125,000 euros is exempt. After that, any amount up to 875,000 carries a 7 percent stamp duty, and any amount over 875,000 has a 9 percent stamp duty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said this house will have a stamp duty of about 154,000 euros ($200,000 at $0.32 to the euro). Buyers also pay legal costs ranging from 0.5 to 1 percent of the purchase price; Ms. Grant said the seller pays the real estate agent's commission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financing is scarce these days for botj locals and foreigners, but Ms. Grant said most buyers of country estates in County Wicklow are cash buyers who don't need financing.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks fell on Tuesday, pulling the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span> 500-stock index down from a 10-week high, as weaker-than-estimated data on home sales, factory orders and consumer spending cast doubt on the economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Procter &amp;Gamble</span> slid 3.4 percent. <span class="companylink">Dow Chemical</span> dropped 10 percent after its earnings missed estimates. Losses were limited as <span class="companylink">Pfizer</span> rose 5.6 percent to lead a rally in health companies after its earnings beat estimates. Energy shares gained as oil rose $1.21 to settle at $82.55 a barrel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After two days of gains, the S.&amp;P. 500 slipped 5.40 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,120.46. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 38 points, or 0.4 percent, to close at 10,636.38. The Nasdaq composite index lost 11.84 points, or 0.5 percent, finishing at 2,283.52.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a lot of uncertainty on the part of investors because they see economic reports coming in a bit weaker than earlier this year,'' said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Banyan Partners in New York. ''We're still on a path to recovery, but it's going to be a very slow-growth recovery.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Benchmark indexes opened lower after Commerce Department data showed that consumer spending and personal incomes in the United States were unexpectedly unchanged in June, signaling that a lack of jobs was hurting the biggest part of the economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks extended losses after the National Association of Realtors' index of pending home resales dropped 2.6 percent from the previous month. Economists projected a 4 percent gain, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey. The Commerce Department said orders placed with factories declined 1.2 percent in June. A survey of economists projected a 0.5 percent decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A flat to sluggish economy is what we are seeing,'' said Barry R. James, president of James Investment Research in Alpha, Ohio. ''The consumer is pulling back.'' Mr. James expects ''another wash-out in stock prices,'' probably before the end of the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal Reserve policy makers have signaled that they probably will not provide more stimulus at their Aug. 10 meeting and will wait to see if signs of weaker economic growth persist. The Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, told lawmakers in South Carolina on Monday that consumer spending was ''likely to pick up'' amid a moderate expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Procter &amp;Gamble</span> dropped $2.12, to $59.94 after reporting fiscal fourth-quarter profit of 71 cents a share, trailing the average analyst estimate of 73 cents in a Bloomberg survey. Profit excluding some items will be as much as $1.01 a share in the first quarter, the company forecast, compared with the $1.05 average analyst estimate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Dow Chemical</span> dropped $2.83 to finish at $25.50. Second-quarter net income was $651 million, or 50 cents a share, in contrast to a net loss of $344 million, or 47 cents, a year earlier, Dow said. Profit excluding some items was 54 cents, compared with the 57-cent average estimate of analysts in a Bloomberg survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> retreated 67 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $28.45, and the home builder the Pulte Group fell 55 cents, or 6.1 percent, to $8.43. A gauge of home builders across S.&amp;P. indexes tumbled 3.7 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Today Dow is a disappointment, and <span class="companylink">Procter &amp;Gamble</span>, but on the whole you have to be very encouraged,'' said Henry B. Smith, chief investment officer at Haverford Trust in Radnor, Pa. ''When you factor in valuations down in the 12-to-13-times range in a low-inflation, low-interest-rate environment, it makes equities look very attractive.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Pfizer</span> climbed 86 cents, to close at $16.34. It reported second-quarter adjusted earnings of 62 cents a share. The average analyst estimate in a Bloomberg survey was 52 cents a share.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 10-year Treasury note rose 15/32 to 105. The yield fell to 2.91, from 2.96 late Monday.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THERE are times when Maurice Vaughn, the former major league baseball player universally called Mo, is treated like a businessman -- usually when he is deep in talks to buy ratty apartment buildings and make them habitable again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there are times when he is treated like catnip -- usually by women, like the ones who spotted him strolling through the cleaned-up courtyard of one such apartment complex in Brownsville, Brooklyn, called the Plaza, that Mr. Vaughn and his partners bought in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''How ya doin' Mo Vaughn,'' they crooned in near-unison. ''Mo Vaughn? Mo Vaaaauuuuugghnn.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Vaughn, 42 -- and married with a 5-year-old daughter -- cuts an unlikely figure in New York's real estate world, not just because women are drawn to him, or because he is 6-foot-2 and 280 pounds under his custom-made suit, Donald Pliner loafers and diamond studs. Charismatic and massive, enduringly famous and comfortably rich, he brings a dose of glamour to the decidedly unsexy world of low-income housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is where Mr. Vaughn, a star slugger for the Boston Red Sox who quit baseball in 2003 after a lackluster run with the Mets, decided to build what he called his ''afterlife'' from the ashes of his baseball career. His six-year-old company, Omni New York LLC, is on its way to becoming a major player in the low-income housing world. It has acquired 4,000 apartments, most of them in New York State's scrappiest neighborhoods, housing the poorest of tenants (98 percent of them qualify for Section 8 rent subsidies).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a city obsessed with the gilded cocoons of the rich, the company has forged a reputation for turning around properties once deemed untouchable in the caste system of New York real estate -- like the Plaza, where drug dealers once openly sold their own brand of heroin, guarded by pit bulls whose food was laced with gunpowder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Vaughn, both teddy-bearish and intimidating, is the leader of an unlikely triumvirate. His Omni partners are a Russian expatriate named Eugene Schneur, 38, his lawyer and friend since baseball days, and Robert Bennett, 46, who has years of experience financing low-income housing. The firm began buying in 2004, focusing on so-called acquisition rehabs -- older properties in various stages of decrepitude, often with absentee landlords and teetering finances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, it has bought and rehabilitated 23 sites in New York, Massachusetts and Wyoming for a total of $503 million. Other deals worth $205 million for 1,000 units, most in the Bronx, are scheduled to close in September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Is he a big deal in New York real estate? He's becoming a big deal,'' said Harold Shultz, a senior fellow with the Citizens Housing and Planning Council, a research group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's unusual to have someone famous; usually this field is small operators,'' Mr. Shultz added. ''But Mo, he was serious.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other professional athletes have become developers in retirement -- Tate George, a former guard for the Nets, has spearheaded projects including affordable housing in places like Newark and Bridgeport, N.J. But many more have gravitated toward flashier, more commercial ventures, like movie theaters and restaurants (Magic Johnson); grilling devices (George Foreman); barbeque sauce (William Perry, ''the Refrigerator''); and bars or nightclubs (too many players to count).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Vaughn, who was born in Norwalk, Conn., and now splits his time between a 3,000-square-foot rental at 52nd Street and Second Avenue in Manhattan and a five-bedroom home in Coral Gables, Fla., said he chose this field because it seemed like a way to both do some good and make some money, with minimum risk. And though he spent the high points of his baseball career in Boston and was largely lampooned as an overweight has-been while with the Mets, Mr. Vaughn said he chose to make this city the center of his business interests because he ''felt bad how it ended for me in New York.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I always had dreams of coming to New York, driving through the boroughs, and knowing people through baseball,'' Mr. Vaughn said from his office on the 31st floor of the Dag Hammarskjold building on the East Side. ''Now I know people in the boroughs for different reasons. Good reasons.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking out over the United Nations building and the East River below, he added, ''I knew the test of a man was what he's going to do with his afterlife.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHIRLEY VAUGHN, an elementary school teacher, taught her son to hit in the backyard when he was 2, showing him the left-handed stance he would stick with throughout his career despite being a rightie. His father, Leroy Vaughn, a high school principal and coach, used to pitch and Shirley would catch the fly balls (when she could). ''From as far as I can remember back, and even in the big leagues, they almost never missed my home games,'' said Mo Vaughn, who has two older sisters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He went to a boarding school, Trinity Pawling, in upstate New York, where he excelled in football, basketball and baseball. The athletic director there was the one who started calling him Mo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Seton Hall University in South Orange, N.J., he studied communications and broke the career home run record, with 57 (in three years). Friends called him ''Hit Dog.'' He was Big East Conference Player of the Decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Vaughn, a first baseman, left college without a degree for the minor leagues, logging 13 homers in 36 games with the Triple-A Pawtucket Red Sox.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He moved up to the majors in 1991, and his bleacher-reaching blasts made him a darling of Red Sox Nation, which greeted him with stadium-filling roars of ''Mo! Mo! Mo!'' The news media took the name and ran: Mo better. Mo hits, Mo R.B.I. Mo fun. ''Mo appears destined for Im-Mo-tality,'' a writer for The St. Louis Post-Dispatch raved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1995, Mr. Vaughn was anointed the American League's most valuable player; a year later, his batting average was a lofty .326. In 1998, the Los Angeles Angels signed him for a record-breaking $82 million six-year contract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then Mr. Vaughn's luck turned. On opening day with the Angels, while trying to catch a pop fly, he tumbled down the dugout steps, wrenching his knee and tearing ligaments in his ankle. His game was never the same. He was traded to the Mets in late 2001, but was heavier by then, with a plummeting batting average and lingering injuries. After a disappointing run and more injuries -- including getting his hand broken by a pitch -- he retired in 2003.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Vaughn plunged into a disconcerting vacuum that he had long feared. A nightclub he owned in Ohio had closed, and his late-1990s investments in three East Village bars -- Opal, Opaline and the Boysroom -- had flat-lined. Mr. Schneur, the lawyer, urged him to think bigger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Years before, Mr. Vaughn had met some low-income-housing developers who made a profit using what seemed like Monopoly money: federal tax credits, state-issued bonds and other subsidies. Fueled by a potent mix of guilt over his failures in New York, altruism and opportunism, Mr. Vaughn asked Mr. Schneur to look into the possibilities. Mr. Schneur called up a friend, Edward Skyler, who was Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's press secretary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Mo wants to give something back,'' Mr. Schneur recalled telling Mr. Skyler.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time, the city was in the throes of a tree-planting campaign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Does Mo want to plant some trees?'' Mr. Schneur recalled Mr. Skyler asking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lawyer hung up and relayed the query to the retired slugger, who, Mr. Schneur said, responded something to the effect of he ''didn't want to plant any expletive trees.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I want to do housing,'' Mr. Vaughn repeated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN 2004, with the real estate boom in full swing, seasoned developers were closing on deals to build mixed- and low-income buildings at a quick clip. Mr. Vaughn and Mr. Schneur hired Mr. Bennett and several former city housing officials to show their seriousness, and scheduled meetings with the city's housing gurus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They were nimble, and very smart about it, which was great,'' said John Warren, a former first deputy commissioner with the housing department.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city was shopping for a new owner for two troubled sites in the Bronx, Thessalonica Court and Brookhaven Apartments, that were nearing foreclosure. Officials figured they had little to lose. ''We thought, 'Here's a project that's in some trouble, not a lot. No one's looking to buy it,' '' recalled Mr. Shultz, who was then special counsel to the housing department. '' 'Let's see what they can do with this.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Omni New York bought the two sites, totaling five buildings, with $28.6 million in tax-exempt bond financing, and began what would become its signature overhaul.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Vaughn and his comrades met with tenants to issue assurances and log complaints. Construction crews patched holes, mended leaky ceilings and installed new lights, kitchen cabinets, bathroom tiles, toilets and tubs. Security cameras were installed by the dozens in hallways, forcing drug dealers and prostitutes into stairwells -- until Omni installed security cameras there, too. Electronic wands replaced keys to thwart replication. Public spaces were repainted a pinkish hue selected by Mr. Schneur, who thought it uplifting and noninstitutional. The color would end up in all of their buildings; Mr. Vaughn calls it ''Gene's Peach.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two and a half years later, Omni New York cemented its reputation as a rescuer of lost causes by buying Noble Drew Ali Plaza in Brownsville, widely considered the worst complex in the city. It was rechristened the Plaza and Omni-fied, with new kitchens, Gene's Peach and 356 security cameras.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Urban Homesteading Assistance Board, a tenant advocacy group, helped engineer Omni's purchase of 14 failing South Bronx buildings that speculators had bought and abandoned during the boom. Some critics groused that <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span>, which held $23.8 million in mortgage debt on the buildings, provided too steep a discount in selling for $5 million, but when the deal was finalized on July 12 this year in a courtroom auction, the benches were filled with cheering tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I love them -- as much as I can love any landlord,'' said Megan Reed, an Urban Homesteading organizer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You could hear the chatter go through the building, the older people saying, 'Oh, this is just great,' '' recalled Laura Andrews, who lives in a building that Omni recently took over in Harlem. ''We weren't asking for chandeliers, just basic things. We're regular people, poor people, who want to live decently.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amid the accolades, some tenants complain that drug dealing has persisted at places like the Plaza, and that Mr. Vaughn should give more back. ''If he really wants to help the community, he should pay for scholarships,'' said Joan Johnson, one of the women who catcalled Mr. Vaughn in the courtyard that day. ''You can't get a job these days without a master's degree.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Vaughn and his associates would not say how large their rent roll is, how much profit the company makes or how much it spends operating the buildings. Low-income developers generally collect fees worth up to 10 percent of the purchase price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You run these properties well, you run a lot of them, you make money on volume,'' Mr. Schneur said. ''That's always been our business plan.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OMNI is hardly the city's biggest affordable-housing developer. CPC Resources, based in Manhattan, has built three times as many units. But Omni's quick growth -- the company has 180 employees -- has combined with Mr. Vaughn's celebrity to turn heads (and raise hackles: One developer, noting his own decades of work in the field, said he was ''insulted'' at having been asked about Mr. Vaughn's work. Why profile this upstart and not him?)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Vaughn's office at the Dag Hammarskjold building is a disorganized amalgam of his life and ''afterlife.'' File folders and fan mail are piled high on window ledges. Boxes litter the floor. Framed baseball jerseys line one wall; a television fixed (and muted) on ESPN is mounted on another. Three Swarovski crystal gorilla figurines sit on his desk, gifts from his daughter, Grace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's how she sees me,'' he said. ''That's Daddy, right there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If his wallet is firmly implanted in New York, Mr. Vaughn's heart is in Florida. Every 10 days or so, he heads south -- sometimes on his private tour bus because he does not like to fly -- to be with his wife, Gail Turkovich; Grace; and their 11-year-old English bulldog, Juice-Man.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple met in 1994 at a bar in Cleveland, Ms. Turkovich's hometown, and married in 2000. During the bitter winter of 2003, Ms. Turkovich went on vacation to Florida and fell in love. ''Sell the house,'' she instructed her husband over the phone, ''and send my stuff.'' The couple paid $1.9 million in 2005 for a house in Cocoplum, a neighborhood of Coral Gables.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One evening in June, Mr. Vaughn, Mr. Bennett and Mr. Schneur sauntered into the community room of a Bronx apartment building to meet with tenants. Aluminum platters of chicken and salad had been laid out, and Mr. Bennett popped a garlic knot into his mouth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Omni trio had arrived, as usual, in a black chauffeured sport utility vehicle, with Mr. Vaughn riding shotgun, Mr. Schneur behind him and Mr. Bennett behind the driver. They each wore crisp suits without ties, the first two buttons of their shirts undone. Mr. Schneur, baby-faced and balding, educated at Stuyvesant High School and Cornell University, is the brains of the operation. Mr. Bennett might be described as the beauty, in a slightly going-to-seed sort of way, with a gelled forelock on his forehead and a chin smudged with stubble. Mr. Vaughn, of course, is the brawn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three dozen tenants stared skeptically as Mr. Schneur explained Omni's grand plans and answered queries for half an hour, and then the old slugger lumbered to his feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The room quieted as people took the measure of Mr. Vaughn. His head seemed to brush the ceiling. His body seemed to block out light.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I want you to understand,'' he began, ''we're very good at what we do.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Vaughn complimented the tenants for organizing and fighting for new ownership. He told them to be patient. He asked for their trust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tenants began sitting up straighter. Heads began to nod. Mr. Vaughn was doing what countless coaches had done through the ages: giving an old-fashioned pep talk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I know you're anxious; I'd be anxious, too,'' he reassured them. ''Although I've never been in a situation that you're in now, we've been doing this a long time. Just hang in there. Stay together.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He sat down to whoops and claps. The tenants looked at one another, allowing themselves a few hopeful grins.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BP is sounding decisive and radical. The beleaguered British oil major is expanding its existing asset disposal program to $30 billion and looking to cut debt after announcing a $32 billion charge on its Gulf of Mexico oil spill in Tuesday's earnings report. And Tony Hayward is to step down as chief executive. But for Mr. Hayward's American successor, Robert Dudley, one big challenge is to turn this into a convincing story for the company's stock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big second-quarter charge is BP's best guess at its spill liabilities. It is well below some worst-case estimates of $50 billion or more. And BP is assuming the costs can be written off against tax, leaving a net cost of $22 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end, BP may find it politically difficult to make all the costs tax deductible. It is also banking on not being found grossly negligent. If it were, Clean Water Act fines would be significantly higher. The company's assumption for the amount of oil spilled, which determines fines, is also below the top end of the federal estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, the final cost could be lower if BP's partners in the stricken gulf well assume their 35 percent share of the liability.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BP is, in any event, retaining financial flexibility. The company is still a formidable money machine. It generated nearly $9 billion of operating cash flow in the second quarter. The decision to sell assets to cover the bulk of the spill costs should cut net debt from $23 billion to as low as $10 billion over the next 18 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It won't be easy for BP to get good prices for all the assets it wants to sell. But last week's $7 billion deal with Apache shows the company has holdings that are worth more to others. If Mr. Dudley can keep that going with other disposals, the new, smaller BP will have a more concentrated portfolio of quality assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That provides the makings of an attractive story for equity investors -- especially if a stronger balance sheet is part of the equation. But a recovering BP could also be an attractive acquisition target for a stronger rival. The plan Mr. Dudley must execute is risky and offers no quick fix. He faces a nervous honeymoon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Testing the Tests</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Don't be fooled into believing the housing market in the United States is rebounding. True, May's Case-Shiller 20-city house price index bounced 4.6 percent year-on-year. But that was driven largely by the federal home buyer tax credit, an artificial one-time stimulus. With jobs scarce and confidence falling, a further drop now looks likely. That will test the limits of last year's bank stress tests.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $8,000 tax credit was valid for contracts entered into before April 30. So house prices in the three months to May benefited from an unnatural support. Both new and existing home sales have declined since the end of April, suggesting a sag in home prices to come.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the Case-Shiller index still stands some 47 percent above where it was in January 2000, against a consumer price index rise of 29 percent over the same period. While the United States has enjoyed economic and population growth since 2000, the housing market was already buoyant at the turn of the century. A 12 percent drop from here would bring home prices in line with the decade's consumer price inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That would further erode confidence and dent consumer balance sheets. It would also ding bank earnings and capital. Last year's Federal Reserve-led bank stress tests involved a ''base case'' that included a housing price decline of 17.4 percent from December 2008 levels by 2010, and a second ''adverse'' case based on a 27.5 percent decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The good news is that house prices are currently only 2.1 percent below their levels in December 2008. So even a 15 percent further decline would take them only to the base case level used in the stress tests. But an uptick in joblessness combined with further house price declines would get closer to the adverse case.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If regulators' calculations on bank capital were right, even that wouldn't presage another banking crisis because the Fed forced larger banks to raise sufficient capital to handle the adverse case. But it would hurt earnings and probably cause banks to become even more cautious about lending. That could make any double dip doubly bad.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BLUFFTON, S.C. -- This month Palmetto Bluff, a high-end resort community near Hilton Head, S.C., will break ground on an organic garden. In this age of eating local food and sustainable growing, the concept is hardly novel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What makes Palmetto Bluff's garden different is its ambitions. When completed it will be part of a 100-acre farm with crops that include rice, green tea and sugar cane, as well as a full complement of livestock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The farm is in keeping with the larger vision for the 22,000-acre community, which is the product of three longtime builders who set out to explore a model of development that would be kinder and gentler on the landscape, but still be financially viable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Look, I don't want to say this is our last rodeo,'' said James W. Mozley, the chief executive of Palmetto Bluff. ''But at a certain point, you realize that you're going to be remembered for something, and it's up to you to decide what that's going to be.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Together with William G. Peacher, now president of real estate at Palmetto Bluff, and David Howerton of the architectural and planning firm Hart Howerton, Mr. Mozley planned the resort around the question: Do people looking for planned communities in the area wind up at country clubs because they like them, or because that's all there is?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To answer this question, they were determined to challenge a set of development rules that had all but hardened into stereotypes. Rather than sell the waterfront, they would preserve it, using much of it for public parkland. A maximum home size would be mandated -- there would be no faux mansions here. Driveways would be hidden, to avoid the look-what-I-drive syndrome.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of building out every available inch, a scant third of the permitted area would be developed. And rather than fence in the property, they would invite the public in. Arriving by boat would be easy since the piers would be public. And so would arrival through the front drive, which would not be gated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first, support for the project was resoundingly negative. After a focus group presentation in 2002 that included more than 50 investors, real estate agents and developers, interest in the project was requested by a show of hands. Not one was raised.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the developers pressed on, and in 2004 sales began at Palmetto Bluff. And the community is now about 20 percent built. At completion, expected in 20 years, there will be 2,900 homes, three villages and a rural area with the farm. But, Mr. Howerton said, ''the eraser is always more important than a pencil. As times change, values and attitudes will change, and we have to adjust to that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The resort has weathered the downturn relatively well. Palmetto Bluff is a subsidiary of <span class="companylink">Crescent Resources</span>, a land management and development company based in Charlotte, N.C., that in June emerged from Chapter 11 protection after a financial restructuring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Peacher said that while building slowed to a near stop and sales fell sharply, prices held steady. ''People still bought,'' he said, ''but they took much longer to decide to do so.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers at Palmetto Bluff said they were drawn to its aesthetic, which is undeniably romantic in its interpretations of Lowcountry towns like Beaufort, S.C., and Savannah, Ga. ''We'd actually go sketch these places, asking ourselves, 'Why do people love it here?' '' Mr. Mozley said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, a drive that terminates at the waterfront in the center of the village was borrowed from Beaufort. Architectural elements include a white chapel with a steeple, a homey cafe and porches on nearly every home.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices range from $150,000 for a lot in the village to over $8 million for a 30-acre ''family compound'' parcel -- only two to three acres of which can be built on in order to maintain the water quality of the May River. Buyers are assessed membership fees for amenities that include two pools, a fitness center, boating facilities, and a canoe club with restaurant, a total of about $6,000 a year. An optional golf club membership to play the Jack Nicklaus signature course is $75,000, with annual dues.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Land use at Palmetto Bluff is governed by a complex arrangement of profit and nonprofit elements that marry protected land with development. Patricia R. Kennedy, director of the Palmetto Bluff Conservancy, said that of the 22,000 acres of maritime forest, saltwater marshes and May River headwaters that make up the resort, 300 acres were owned by a conservancy, 5,024 acres were managed forest preserve and 439 acres were privately owned conservation easements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To guarantee a revenue stream to sustain and expand these land protection efforts, buyers pay real estate transfer fees up to one-half of 1 percent -- no small thing given that property prices often run into the millions. The fees are guaranteed in perpetuity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Sneddon, one of the founders of Fairway markets in the New York area, is among the many Northeasterners who own homes at Palmetto Bluff. ''A country club is the last place on earth that my wife and I would ever want to live,'' Mr. Sneddon said. ''I mean, I'm the guy who was all over Red Hook, Brooklyn. But this place is not uppity. It's real and it's simple, but in a really vast way that made immediate sense to me.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Casey B. Mulligan is an economics professor at the University of Chicago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Home Buyer Tax Credit contained in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 has been given much credit for buoying the housing market. But simple arithmetic shows that the credit's effect has been minimal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The law passed in February 2009 included a temporary 10 percent capped tax credit for qualified first-time home buyers. Later the program was expanded to include repeat home buyers, and recently home buyers were given until September 2010 to complete their qualified transaction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> released its housing price index for May 2010, and yesterday the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller index was released. Both show that housing prices have not fallen significantly, if at all, from what they were a year before. News articles have asserted that housing prices stopped falling because of the tax credit and have planted seeds of worry that a housing-market collapse could continue when the credit expires.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Internal Revenue Service reports that only $19 billion of tax credits have been claimed so far. The average credit was $6,000 to $7,000, small compared with the average sales price for a home of more than $200,000. More importantly, most home sales transactions involved no tax credit because the buyer was unqualified, or perhaps unaware. If these transactions were at all affected by the credit, it was only because they occurred in a wider market in which some transactions did involve credits.But the wider market is quite a bit wider: the stock of owner-occupied houses in the United States is worth about $14 trillion, with an additional $3 trillion of rental housing. From this perspective, the $19 billion in first-time home buyer tax credits amounts to about one-tenth of 1 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the same reason, the possible expiration of credit is not an important event for the housing market.&nbsp;The credit was not designed to last more than year or two, whereas houses last decades or even centuries. Most of the value of a house accrues in the decades after the first year or two of its existence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Certainly some housing construction projects and housing purchase deals were accelerated to conclude before the credit expired. But accelerating a deal is far different than creating a deal out of thin air.&nbsp; That's why I expect little, if any, housing price reduction after the credit expires.</p>

</div><div class="author">By REUTERS </div><div>625 words</div><div>27 July 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Sales of new single-family homes rebounded strongly in June from the previous month's record low, pushing the inventory of new houses on the market to the lowest level in nearly 42 years, according to government data released Monday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But downward revisions to sales estimates for April and May left in place a picture of a weak housing market and perceptions that economic growth moderated somewhat in the second quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales rose 23.6 percent, to an annual rate of 330,000 units, the data, released jointly by the United States Census Bureau and the Housing and Human Development Department said. Still, the sales rate last month was the second-lowest since the department began compiling the figures in 1963.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We can't take too much joy in one month's figure,'' said Jennifer H. Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. ''The roadblocks to a healthy housing market are high, the most important one being the still-high jobless rate.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The percentage increase last month was the largest since May 1980, and it partly unwound May's 36.7 percent drop. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast new-home sales rising to a 320,000 unit rate last month from May's previously reported 300,000 units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent data have suggested the economy's recovery from its longest and deepest recession since the 1930s slowed in recent months. While economists expect weak housing activity to act as a drag on growth for much of the year, they say they do not believe this would be enough on its own to set off a double-dip recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not going to affect the economy that much,'' said Patrick Newport, an economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Mass. ''It's more the economy affecting the housing market. What we need is for the economy to start creating jobs.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data last week showed home construction fell to an eight-month low in June, while sales of existing homes were the lowest in three months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing's share of the economy has shrunk in recent years, and residential construction accounted for about 2.4 percent of gross domestic product in the first quarter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report suggested that the housing market might be close to working through the distortions after the end of a popular homebuyer tax credit in April, an incentive that pulled sales forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result of last month's surge in sales, the supply of new homes available for sale fell to 7.6 months' worth, from 9.6 months' worth in May. The number of new homes on the market dropped 1.4 percent, to 210,000 units, the lowest level since September 1968.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Progress is being made in reducing the excess inventory, which is crucial for the outlook for prices,'' said Paul Dales, a United States economist at Capital Economics in Toronto. ''However, new-home sales make up just 5 percent of all sales. And the post-tax credit fall-off in activity has yet to fully show up in existing sales. Total home sales have, therefore, yet to hit rock bottom.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median sale price for a new home fell 1.4 percent last month, to $213,400. In the 12 months to June, prices dipped 0.6 percent.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RHINEBECK, N.Y. -- This small town in the Hudson Valley is thrilled that the wedding of the year will be happening here on Saturday. Thrilled -- even though no one can talk about it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, you can practically feel the shopkeepers biting their tongues, wishing they could share details of Chelsea Clinton's wedding, which, according to wedding planners, will inspire many copycat choices among brides in the coming year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rhinebeck residents are proud that their town, two hours north of New York City, was chosen by Ms. Clinton and her fiance, Marc Mezvinsky, and are quick to tell you that this town is not at all like the Hamptons. No Tiffany on Main Street, no weekenders in high heels. But when it comes to the wedding, talk they cannot. Anyone who has agreed to supply anything, from gift bags to appetizers to the location, signed a confidentiality agreement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Word is that the serendipitously named Clinton Vineyards, in nearby Clinton Corners, will provide some of the wine: perhaps its award-winning dessert wine called Desire, which is made from blackberries, or its raspberry wine, Embrace. A stricken-sounding employee who answered the phone at the vineyard said, ''We cannot comment on anything to do with the wine and whatever is going on with that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ira J. Gutner, who owns Samuel's of Rhinebeck, a coffee bar that sells fine chocolates, knows people who are contributing in some way to the wedding and who have signed confidentiality agreements. But he is not divulging anything. And despite a few leaks here and there about local involvement, for the most part the agreements are being honored.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's her wedding, and it's his wedding,'' Mr. Gutner said. ''We want to respect their confidentiality.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Clintons have not confirmed that the wedding is being held in Rhinebeck. But its convenient location makes it logical. For the mother of the bride, or M.O.T.B., as Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has jokingly referred to herself in State Department memos, the appeal of Rhinebeck is plain. The town is 54 miles north (as the crow flies) of her home in Chappaqua, N.Y., allowing for quick dashes to check on details.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Clintons are trying hard to keep it from being a circus, and so far the people of Rhinebeck are trying to oblige. The local police have already arrested two people -- a Norwegian photographer and a newspaper editor -- for trespassing on the Astor Courts estate, which is assumed to be the location of the wedding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Designed by Stanford White in 1902 for John Jacob Astor IV, it is a sumptuous Beaux-Arts house on the outskirts of town. The estate's owners, Kathleen Hammer, a generous donor to Mrs. Clinton, and her husband, Arthur Seelbinder, a real estate developer, bought it in 2005 for $3.2 million and spent years on renovations. They put it up for sale last year for $12 million, but took it off the market this month. The two people arrested, Thomas Bjorn Nilsson, 43, of New York, and Kjersti Sortland, 41, of Norway, disregarded ''no trespassing'' signs near the gates to the property, and face 15 days in jail and/or a fine of up to $250 if found guilty, according to Maj. Michael A. Kopy of the New York State Police.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residents who live close to the presumed ceremony site have been calling the police to complain about trespassers. ''The media are entering on private properties all along the area,'' said Sgt. Peter Dunn of the Village of Rhinebeck Police Department. ''Some of the residents have had multiple reporters on their property on more than one occasion. We advise residents to ask them to leave, and everyone so far has left when they're asked.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Rhinebeck Area Chamber of Commerce, in the meantime, has been flooded with calls from people looking for places to stay. ''There are people who are genuinely happy that Chelsea's getting married and that she found somebody, and they want to be part of that in some way,'' said Nancy O. Amy, the chamber's executive director. ''There are curiosity seekers. There are people who want to be part of history.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But most hotel rooms were snapped up months ago. On a single day in the spring, someone took all 31 rooms at the neo-Classical Belvedere Mansion in nearby Staatsburg. The Beekman Arms, the largest hotel in the village, is fully booked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cari Meltzer, the owner of Looking Glass Bed &amp;Breakfast, which has only four rooms, said she was contacted by someone before Easter who asked for several rooms but declined to give the names of the guests. ''She said, 'We'll call two or three days before and give you the names,' '' Mrs. Meltzer said. ''It's very mysterious.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But all the media attention on local purveyors is just reminding some of them that they have not made the cut. Although it has been widely reported that the restaurant Terrapin will be catering some wedding events, its publicist, Paul Shiavo, denied that. ''We are not involved in any way, shape or form with regard to this wedding,'' he said. ''It was rumor and hearsay, and that's the most I can say about that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, clearly, Mr. Shiavo was disappointed. The Clintons, he said, should have reached out to more local vendors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If there's a wedding of this magnitude there, it's going to be a pain,'' he said. ''We would have hoped that if there was a wedding there that they would have used a few more of our local businesses for some of their needs.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, shopkeepers hope the influx of 400 guests and countless journalists from around the world will leave a lasting impact on the town's economy, which has had its fits and starts through the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The wedding has put the word 'Rhinebeck' into people's minds,'' said Suzanna Hermans, a co-owner of Oblong Books, who drove to work Friday while hearing the flutter of helicopters she said she believed were associated with the wedding. ''Money is still tight around here,'' she said. ''One week to the next is completely different. We're hoping in the long run this will bring people to Rhinebeck.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Celebrities including Bette Midler, Liam Neeson and Annie Leibovitz have weekend houses in the area, which is filled with horse farms and wineries. ''It's very laid back, but it's a civilized laid back,'' said Gail Saucier, a real estate agent and former bond trader who moved here from Manhattan a few years after 9/11. ''I always joke that I'll stay here until there is a Tiffany on Main Street. Then it will be time to go.'' She and her fellow agents at Better Homes and Gardens Rand Realty ordered up a cream-and-teal banner with the message ''Congrats Chelsea and Marc'' for their storefront on East Market Street. ''Let's welcome them to town,'' she said, ''and hopefully we'll get some sales.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: July 28, 2010, Wednesday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Monday about the upcoming wedding of Chelsea Clinton in Rhinebeck, N.Y., misstated the occupation and gender of one of the two Norwegian journalists accused of trespassing on the Astor Courts estate, which is assumed to be the location of the wedding. Kjersti Sortland, a woman, is a newspaper editor -- not a photographer. (The other Norwegian journalist is a photographer.)</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">SHORT SALES!</span>
</div><div class="author">By VIVIAN S. TOY </div><div>2304 words</div><div>25 July 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WITH property values down by as much as 30 percent in New York City, some homeowners who bought at the height of the market are finding themselves underwater and are being forced to sell their homes in short sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the months after the <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> crash, most of the short-sale action was in the boroughs outside of Manhattan and in the suburbs. This year, however, short sales appear to be picking up in Manhattan, real estate and mortgage brokers say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent search of sales listings found almost 20 advertised short sales, and that did not include short sales disguised with euphemistic terms like ''owner must sell.'' The advertised short sales range from a $250,000 two-bedroom on the Upper East Side to a $2 million three-bedroom designed by Philippe Starck in the financial district. They include town houses, co-ops, condops and condos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the number of short sales, in which a home sells for less than the amount owed on the mortgage, will most likely continue to grow. The number of lis pendens filings -- a first step in the foreclosure process for houses and condos -- doubled in 2009 in Manhattan, to 724 from 334 in 2008; this year, 382 had been filed by the end of June, according to the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy of New York University.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Short sales are happening and they're all over the map,'' said Melissa Cohn, the president of the Manhattan Mortgage Company. ''We're seeing multimillion-dollar foreclosures and short sales that no one ever anticipated in New York City.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel and a market analyst, said that 2010 might well be dubbed the Year of the Short Sale nationally. ''A short sale is going to be the only way for many people who bought at the peak and who are now underwater to move on with their lives if they have to relocate or downsize,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Short sales are a gentler alternative to foreclosure for both sellers and lenders. ''Compared to a foreclosure, a short sale generally allows an easier transition for the borrower, less impact on their credit history, and larger net proceeds to the loan's owner,'' said Tom Kelly, a spokesman for <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span>, adding that Chase encourages borrowers who are unable to keep their homes to consider short sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some advertised short sales seem like bargains, but most are priced just a little under market -- low enough to generate interest from buyers, but not too low to raise objections from lenders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Short sales, however, are not for the faint-hearted. While there is a possibility for a good price, there is also a good chance that the deal will not go through. Many cooks are involved in this stew. The buyer must negotiate the price with both the seller and the seller's lender. At the same time, the seller must negotiate with the lender on the terms for forgiving the amount still owed on the mortgage. Meanwhile the bank is negotiating fees for lawyers and brokers. The process can take six to nine months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Sharay Hayes, who owns a four-story town house on Strivers Row in Harlem, a short sale may be the only way to avoid bankruptcy. Mr. Hayes inherited a share of the house, where he has lived since he was 3, from his grandfather in 2001. Over the years, he took out several mortgages to buy out six relatives and to restore the house's 19th-century grandeur while renovating it with 21st-century finishes and luxuries like a steam room and a whirlpool tub.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until late last year, he kept up with payments on the $1.8 million he owes on the house. But his ''entire portfolio of income earning was in real estate,'' he said, namely rental properties in Ohio. Those investments went south when the auto plant that employed most of his tenants was shuttered about a year ago; he also is on the verge of losing these properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's another nightmare I'm trying to wake up from,'' Mr. Hayes said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has had his Harlem home on and off the market since 2006 for as much as $2.9 million, but with the recession, houses in the immediate area now are selling for closer to $1 million. His current broker, Gordon Sokich, the president of Luxor Homes and Investment Realty, an agency that specializes in distressed property sales, advised him to put it on the market for $850,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The low price prompted a bidding war and the house is now in contract for $975,000. Mr. Sokich said he expected the bank to counter with a higher price. ''We don't know what the bank's bottom line is,'' he said. He added that because Mr. Hayes has several liens on the house, the first lien is probably the only one that will be repaid in full.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Once I conceded that I was going to lose my home,'' Mr. Hayes said, ''I felt like every day I was in the bedroom with my shades drawn, hoping it would go away.'' But the prospect of a short sale ''buys me some time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because lenders can always sue after a short sale for what is still owed on a mortgage, sellers are advised to ask their lenders to waive the right to sue. But even with a waiver, lenders will often try to make up some of what is owed, either by seeking a cash payment at the closing or a promissory note. Any amount that is forgiven can be considered income by the Internal Revenue Service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The seller generally walks away with nothing,'' said John Bradbury, a Manhattan lawyer who has taught seminars on short sales to real estate agents. ''but they get out from under a mortgage they can no longer afford.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Short sales often take months because many mortgages are owned by multiple investors, each of whom must agree to the process. Banks, too, are overwhelmed by foreclosure filings and applications for loan modifications. In addition, banks are not about to broadcast how much of a loss they're willing to take in a short sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's no 1-800 number that you can call to find out what a bank will take,'' Mr. Bradbury said. ''It's all done on a case-by-case basis, which is what lends itself to the painfully long process.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Phil Tesoriero, the owner of Exceptional Homes Real Estate in Farmingdale, N.Y., and the teacher of a certification course on short sales, said he had seen short sales take anywhere from 45 days to 18 months. He has handled scores of short sales in Queens and Long Island, where he estimated there are a few thousand short sale listings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finding the right person at a bank to approve a short sale is often the biggest problem. ''That person hasn't been born yet,'' Mr. Tesoriero deadpanned. ''If I get the same person on the phone twice, it's a miracle.'' The best way to deal with that, he said, ''is to present a proposal that doesn't require much conversation.'' And, he added, ''that means sending a proposal that makes sense for the bank.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He urged starting with a list price not too far off the market value, providing good comparables to support the price, and not wasting the bank's time by presenting hopelessly lowball offers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carol Kaplan, a spokeswoman for the American Bankers Association, said that short sales, like foreclosures and mortgage modifications, had been long processes in recent years, ''because of the number of them in the pipeline and the amount of paperwork involved.'' She said that although banks preferred short sales to foreclosures, ''they also want to make sure that there is no other option that would allow the homeowner to repay the loan in full.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Banks generally will not entertain a short sale until a seller has a signed contract and 10 percent down from a prospective buyer. The Obama administration started a program this spring to encourage more short sales by allowing lenders to preapprove a listing price and setting time limits for the approval process. But many people in Manhattan do not qualify for the program, because it excludes anyone who owes more than $729,750 and whose monthly payment exceeds 31 percent of gross income.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is only when the offer is in hand that the seller submits an application to the bank. This includes a hardship letter documenting why he or she can no longer pay the mortgage -- kind of like a co-op board package in reverse, this time to prove lack of resources.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For buyers, uncertainty is the main thing that sets a short sale apart from a regular sale. Because short sales can take months, a buyer seeking a mortgage may need to seek several extensions on a locked-in rate. Lawyers advise buyers to include a contract clause that allows them to pull out of the deal after a specified time period if the bank drags its heels on a decision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bill Dakak exercised that option earlier this year on the potential short sale of a studio in an Upper East Side co-op. He had a signed contract for $210,000 on a renovated apartment that had sold in 2005 for $399,000. His broker, Mark Baum, an agent with Prudential Douglas Elliman, said that the bank obtained and then somehow lost an appraisal and questioned the comparables provided by the seller's broker. Weeks turned into months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dakak's contract allowed him to back out after three months, and he did. ''You're asking for a response and you get nothing,'' he said. ''I needed to move on, and honestly I walked away from it feeling like the bank wasn't interested in selling.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Dakak, who works in finance in Miami and was looking for a pied-a-terre, wound up spending $160,000 in the same building, on a studio in need of updating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Short sales tend to attract ''somewhat sophisticated buyers,'' said Mary Vetri, a senior vice president of Brown Harris Stevens who helped complete a short sale on a one-bedroom condo in a Midtown high-rise in December. She represented the seller, who had bought the place in 2007 for about $850,000, but then lost his job and tried selling it at $899,000. After a year at that price, it was dropped to $739,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It sold for $690,000, when similar apartments in the building were listed for about $20,000 more. The buyer, Ms. Vetri said, ''didn't need to move right away and he was educated on short sales and involved enough so that we were all focused on getting it accomplished.'' The sale closed six months after going to contract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even when all the paperwork is submitted and various parties work hard to keep a short sale moving, a deal can still unwind after months of waiting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When former clients came to Robin Lyon-Gardiner, a vice president of Brown Harris Stevens, saying they could no longer afford their two-bedroom condo with an office and a garden on the Upper West Side, she knew it would have to be a short sale. The couple owed close to $1.2 million on the place, but a similar apartment in the building had sold in a short sale for $940,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Lyon-Gardiner priced it at $975,000 last August, setting off two bidding wars. The first ended in a contract for $999,000, but that buyer ''got cold feet and walked away,'' she said. The second contract with different buyers was for $1.1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The broker for the buyers, Carla de Leon, an agent at Halstead Property, had taken a class on short sales. She warned her clients that the process could drag on for months. ''I also told them they had to be realistic,'' she said, ''because I had learned that there was only a 60 to 70 percent chance that the deal would even get done.'' But her clients were game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For months, the two brokers were in constant contact with each other, the owner's lawyer and the bank. ''I never got through to anyone who could tell me anything,'' Ms. de Leon said, ''but I felt it was important to keep trying. Because maybe I might get the one person who would feel sorry for me and try to move it along.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At one point, the bank lost the file and the seller had to resubmit the application. Then, about six months after the contract was signed, the bank finally made a decision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''After all that -- it was so much heartache and so much time -- they declined it,'' Ms. Lyon-Gardiner said. ''I never had a listing that so many people wanted and nobody ended up getting.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. de Leon said her buyers, whose deposit was returned, were stunned. ''They didn't understand how the bank could sit on it for so long or why the bank wouldn't want the most they could get for the property,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At last word, the owners planned to declare bankruptcy.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years, the only involvement many retired athletes had with real estate was deciding where to open a steak house with their name on it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some sports stars, looking for a sustainable career outside the arena, have jumped into the development game -- buying hotels, building shopping centers and renovating affordable housing, much of it in and around New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The move to real estate has a number of explanations, investors, developers and analysts say. For one, the leagues are offering classes and workshops to help players make wiser business decisions, and development is an attractive path, they say, because it taps deal-making skills without requiring special licenses or degrees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But benevolence seems to be a motivator, too. Citing a desire to contribute to communities like the ones in which they grew up, former stars like Mo Vaughn, who played for the Red Sox and Mets, and Emmitt Smith, the former Dallas Cowboys running back, are focusing their resources on low-income urban areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Athletes have been notorious for tying up their money in horse farms, or drag racing or record labels, which turned out not to be such sound investments,'' said Wayne McDonnell Jr., an associate professor at New York University who teaches sports business courses. And real estate, with its brash personalities and public clashes, taps into players' competitive natures, he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When their playing days are over, athletes can't just turn off that competitive energy,'' Mr. McDonnell said. ''They need to channel it into different exercises.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What has not changed is that a game-winning score can be an enduring public relations bonanza, which can help get deals done, said Tate George, a basketball star at the University of Connecticut and a first-round pick of the New Jersey Nets in 1990. Mr. George is president of the George Group, a developer that mostly builds affordable homes in Newark, N.J.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, Newark officials often refer to Mr. George's buzzer-beater in 1990 that beat Clemson University in the N.C.A.A. tournament.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That star quality helped pave the way for Mr. George's current project, the rehabilitation of five run-down row houses in the West Ward neighborhood of Newark, where he grew up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The single-family homes, which are being renovated with the Greater Newark Housing Partnership as the first phase of a larger 16-block, $25 million project, go on sale this month for $135,000 to $160,000, so that people making about $40,000 can afford them, Mr. George said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Simultaneously, his company is planning its first commercial undertaking, Seaview Plaza, a 152,000-square-foot waterfront shopping and office complex in Bridgeport, Conn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $35 million project, for which the firm is partners with the Simon Konover Company, a developer in West Hartford, still requires a final land agreement. It would be Mr. George's first development in Connecticut, which had a lot to do with advice he received from his college coach, Jim Calhoun.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He said, 'If you come back here, you've got to do it right, or else they will throw you under the bus,' '' Mr. George said, explaining that he had turned down about 75 other opportunities in Connecticut in the last decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several former athletes, including Joe Namath, George Brett and Pete Rose, have been involved in failed food ventures, and so had Mr. Vaughn, who played most of his career with the Boston Red Sox before moving to the New York Mets. Flo Nitelife, a nightclub Mr. Vaughn opened in Columbus, Ohio, in 2002, around the time he retired from the Mets, closed a few months later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But during that time Mr. Vaughn solidified a relationship with his lawyer, Eugene Schneur, with whom he founded Omni New York in 2004. Omni, which is based in Midtown, rehabilitates dilapidated affordable apartment buildings throughout the Northeast and owns 4,015 apartments in 23 buildings, with an additional 1,200 under contract to close this year, Mr. Schneur said. Included in that group are 415 Bronx apartments formerly owned by the Ocelot Capital Group, which Omni won in a July auction, with closings expected by September.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Mr. Vaughn, who hit 328 home runs in a career that was ended by a knee injury, Omni provides a chance to be socially responsible and to repay the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That wasn't how I should have left the Mets, so I wanted to give something back,'' Mr. Vaughn said on a recent afternoon inside a freshly painted one-bedroom apartment at the Medgar Evers Houses, a sprawling complex in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn. Omni bought the complex this spring, along with the Betty Shabazz apartments across the street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The brick buildings are undergoing a $10 million rehab that will make them more secure. Measures include adding hundreds of security cameras throughout the floors, elevators and stairwells, as well as taller fences and outdoor lights. The goal is to increase the buildings' occupancy levels, which is 85 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similarly focused on urban areas is ESmith Legacy , a commercial development company based in Baltimore that was co-founded by Mr. Smith, the N.F.L.'s career rushing leader.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Smith's latest effort is a mixed-use project in Harlem, at West 125th Street and Malcolm X Boulevard, where a weedy fenced-in lot has sat for years. The project will include 90,000 square feet of retail space, a 100,000-square-foot Hyatt hotel and a 50,000-square-foot Y.M.C.A. The complex will be built with Wharton Properties, a developer in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Smith will control the 10-story hotel part of the complex while Wharton will own the retail spaces, said Eliot Tawil, a principal at Wharton, who said the development would cost about $80 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Smith and Mr. Tawil received a financial boost in June, when the city's Capital Resource Corporation, an arm of the Economic Development Corporation, committed $19.7 million in tax-free bonds to the project if it starts by December.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the first prominent former athletes to go into real estate was Mr. Smith's fellow Cowboy, Roger Staubach, who was a part-time agent while a professional quarterback. That experience led to the Staubach Company, which grew into a multimillion-dollar national company before he sold it to <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>. Mr. Smith worked with Mr. Staubach in the off-season before they started Smith/Cypress Partners, which focused on building shopping centers, in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other recent entrants into the development field include the former San Antonio Spurs center David Robinson; the former Jet Keyshawn Johnson; and the boxer Oscar De La Hoya.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the main inspiration for the latest wave of deals seems to be Magic Johnson. After building inner-city movie theaters in the 1990s, his <span class="companylink">Magic Johnson Enterprises</span> expanded into home building, courtesy of the Canyon Johnson Urban Funds, which is a partnership with Canyon Capital Realty Advisors of Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A recent project is One Hanson Place, condominiums in a former bank in downtown Brooklyn that were developed with the Dermot Company for $267 million. While its location at a busy intersection seems to fulfill the fund's mission to invest in once shabby but gentrifying areas, the condos' prices may seem steep for lower-income buyers. Its 179 units, which are 91 percent sold, average $750 to $900 a square foot, a Canyon spokesman said, while the borough's average figure is about $600.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever their projects' details, some of these former athletes seem content to leave the bright lights of their playing days behind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What I'm doing is not self-serving, but other-serving,'' Mr. George said. ''When you don't work for fanfare, you can get a lot more done.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Once stigmatized as a rough neighborhood, this city's downtown has turned around in the last decade, when a new opera hall, museums, a hockey arena and a convention center began attracting suburban residents taking advantage of a growing light-rail system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residential and commercial construction was poised to follow. But that development momentum stalled in 2008 when the economy receded, leaving the city's first high-rise buildings with few buyers. At the same time, a proposal to develop north San Jose into a second urban hub ground to a halt. Plans to build high- and midrise housing, shops and hotel rooms next to successful technology enterprises were shelved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now that the economy shows signs of picking up, city officials and real estate developers are doubling their efforts to sell apartments and obtain development loans to restart what they say is a San Jose renaissance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's no question that downtown San Jose is like night and day to what it was 10, 15 years ago,'' said Barry Swenson, a native and president of Barry Swenson Builder, who has erected several high-rise towers. ''The downtown is clean as a whistle, there are flowers everywhere, and the streetscape's good.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the goal of creating as many as 10,000 apartments, the city began waiving affordable housing requirements in 2004. Developers fell in line to get approval for the first high-rise towers to be built in this sprawling suburban city, the country's 10th-largest with a population of just under 1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though builders nationwide began pulling back from condominiums in 2006, some San Jose developers persisted. By 2007, 20 towers were reported to be in various stages of development. But just four projects of about 20 stories each were built -- City Heights with 124 units; Axis with 329 units; The 88 with 197 units; and 360 Residences with 213 units, which opened in May. The complexes offer amenities like pools, fitness centers and doormen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Unfortunately, they're coming to market at one of the most miserable times,'' said Shiloh Ballard, the director of housing and community development for the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, a consortium of area business executives. ''If they had come to market three years ago, all the units would have sold.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As it stands, much of the market envisioned for the condo units -- young, well-paid, single technology workers seeking an urban lifestyle who often land in San Francisco -- has disappeared. They have either been laid off, suffered salary cuts or, since housing prices have fallen throughout the Bay Area, now can afford San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The remaining potential buyers have apparently thought twice about paying as much as $700 a square foot for a high-rise condo in a market where the going rate for low-rise apartments has been at most $425.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some of the high-rise developments got to market early enough to attract prerecession buyers. Construction on City Heights, developed by Mr. Swenson's company, began in June 2005, and half its 124 units were sold by November 2007 before sales stalled, the developer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Guerrilla marketing tactics (including a fake picket line of ''protesters'' seeking ''better views'' to attract the attention of potential buyers) and steep price cuts to $372 a square foot have been required to move the remaining units. Penthouses originally priced as high as $1.4 million were reduced to the $600,000 range. The building is more than 80 percent sold, Mr. Swenson said, and prices have reverted to the original $550 a square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wilson Meany Sullivan, a developer based in San Francisco, built a parking garage and installed a <span class="companylink">Safeway</span> as part of constructing the 197-unit 88, which is near San Jose State University. Plans for a second high-rise tower have been deferred for now, said Seth Bland, a partner in the development group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Bland said the developers tried to import the sort of product -- and prices -- more typical of San Francisco. Purchase prices for studio apartments start in the high $200,000s, and penthouses go for more than $2 million. The building is more than half sold, said Paul A. Zeger, the president of Pacific Marketing Associates, which is marketing The 88.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recession also significantly set back city plans to populate north San Jose -- home to more than 1,200 technology companies -- with permanent residents in as many as 32,000 new apartments and houses by 2030.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To create this urban hub near a light-rail system that transports passengers to downtown San Jose and other parts of Silicon Valley, construction of housing units would be connected to job growth in the area -- which has largely been thwarted by the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 26.7 million square feet of new industrial space is being planned. Before the recession, condo and rental projects were on the drawing board, some with thousands of units and some in high-rise buildings, including a two-tower complex with 460 units proposed by Barry Swenson Builder. Now, only one project is under way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">The Irvine Company</span> Apartment Communities plans to build Crescent Village, 1,750 rental apartments on nearly 40 acres near the light-rail system in north San Jose. Crescent Village will consist of five four-story ''villages'' atop underground parking garages.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The development will have amenities like a park, pools, fitness centers and club rooms, said Darin J. Schoolmeester, a principal with MVE &amp;Partners, the architecture firm designing Crescent Village. He said Crescent Village would include retail space, perhaps for small markets, delis, coffee shops or restaurants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Schoolmeester said that even though financing for such master-planned developments withered in the recession, the model was still viable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When the economy starts to hum again,'' he said, ''we'll see a continuation of people really wanting to live in town, close to where everything is, instead of dealing with a commute.''</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">U.S. Home Construction Declined by 5% in June</span>
</div><div class="author">By CHRISTINE HAUSER </div><div>492 words</div><div>21 July 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>12</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction starts on residential buildings declined in June to the lowest level since October, the government reported on Tuesday, as the sector struggles with a tepid recovery and the end of a government tax credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department reported that housing starts in June were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 549,000, about 5 percent below the revised May estimate of 578,000. The June rate was at its lowest level since October 2009 and also fell below analysts' estimates of 580,000, according to a Bloomberg survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The June figures were primarily the result of a 20 percent decline for condominiums and apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another indicator in the report showed that building permits for June were slightly higher at 586,000, up 2 percent compared with May, while those for single-family homes dropped to 421,000 in June, about 3 percent below the figure for May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists watch the figures for housing starts and permits each month because the procurement of a permit to build and the start of construction provide a snapshot of the economy in a variety of ways, including the level of confidence in the economy, the state of the jobs market and possible spending by builders and consumers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It reflects what builders are thinking about the housing market,'' said Patrick Newport, an economist with IHS Global Insight. Referring to the June figures, he said, ''They just don't think they are going to sell many homes, and for good reason.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median time to sell a home in the United States has crept up to about 14 months, he said. ''We need to start creating more jobs,'' Mr. Newport said. A better jobs market would generate demand and get construction back on track.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The numbers also highlighted the dependency of the market on government support in the form of an $8,000 tax credit for buyers who signed contracts before April 30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The reason they were down is further payback from the second homeowners' tax credit,'' Mr. Newport said of the construction starts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another factor that could be affecting the numbers is the overcapacity in the housing market, economists said. And builders acknowledge that any new housing sales will be up against a market of low-priced homes facing foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Financial distress on the part of many households, ongoing labor market weakness and vicious competition from an enormous overhang of existing homes all point to a very tough slog for home builders in the months and quarters ahead,'' Joshua Shapiro, the chief United States economist for MFR Inc., said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GULF SHORES, Ala. -- Nick Wilmott bent down on the beach near the high-tide mark and touched one of the reddish-brown pads of oil. It had washed up overnight from the BP spill off Louisiana and had yet to be cleaned up by the machines that sweep the beaches here every night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Here's your problem,'' said Mr. Wilmott, president of the Baldwin County Association of Realtors. ''Imagine we're on the balcony of a condo that I'm trying to sell you, and you look out and see this.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of beachfront condominiums and homes have plummeted since late April, when oil started gushing into the Gulf of Mexico after the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon rig. Property values are dropping, and the number of apartment rentals is half what it usually is.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a beach town like this, where sales and rentals of vacation homes are the life's blood of the economy, drawing a tide of tourists to fill the restaurants and boutiques, the economic impact has been deep.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everyone in the business -- builders, real estate agents, bankers, lawyers, title companies -- is facing disastrous declines in business. Owners of vacation homes are watching their investments and the number of rental prospects shrink.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The value of coastal property has taken a beating along a 600-mile stretch from the Louisiana bayous to Clearwater, Fla., a stretch that before the spill was worth at least $4.3 billion, just counting the land and buildings within an acre of the shore, according to Norm Miller, an economist at the University of San Diego who is also the vice president of analytics at <span class="companylink">CoStar Group Inc</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After studying recent sales of shoreline property, Mr. Miller estimated that the value of property would drop at least 10 percent, on average, over the next seven years because of the spill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The number of transactions has really dropped off a cliff,'' he said. ''My personal opinion is until the beaches are cleaned up and we are sure they will stay clean, I don't think there will be people buying down there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers in Gulf Shores say that not only are the telephones quiet in their offices, but that once-eager buyers are also backing out of deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What's happening is buyers are just on hold and there are great deals, but they are saying, 'We are going to wait and see what happens with the oil,''' Mr. Wilmott said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rusty and Deana Swanson of Thomasville, Ala., are among them. In late May, they had done everything except close on a three-bedroom condominium on the fourth floor in the Seawind building overlooking the gulf.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The vacation spot was something of a dream home for them and their grown daughter, who uses a wheelchair and takes great pleasure in watching dolphins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the oil spill dragged on, Ms. Swanson said she saw similar condominiums selling for far less than the $290,000 she had agreed to pay. She became worried that she wouldn't be able to rent the apartment to help pay the mortgage, and that it would be worth less than what she was investing. The Swansons pulled the plug on the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm not going to follow through with something when I am watching the prices plummet,'' said Ms. Swanson, a dietitian.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steve Warren, the Swansons' broker, said he had lost other sales for similar reasons. Having sold real estate for about 20 years, Mr. Warren usually closes three or four transactions a month -- from which he earns about $13,000 -- in the summer. ''The last three months, it's been zero,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real estate market here was already depressed, after the burst of the housing bubble in 2008 and the current recession. The market peaked in 2005, when nearly 1,300 condominiums were sold for about $400 a square foot. By 2008, the prices and sales had both been cut in half.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet the market had recovered well in the last two years, brokers said, with the sales of condos -- many of them foreclosures or short sales -- climbing 30 percent a year. Sales were brisk in the first four months of this year, with more than 348 condos changing hands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then came the spill. In the first three weeks of June, the value of condo and home sales was $21 million lower than in the same period the previous year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This has been a sucker punch to what momentum we had,'' said Kevin Corcoran, a Re/Max broker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ripple effect can be seen everywhere. The white beaches, which are groomed every night by crews with mechanical sand sifters, are usually thronged this time of year, but now look like postcards for a remote island.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are dying, literally,'' said Brian Ottosen, 42, the owner of the Happy Shak, a '60s-themed boutique a mile from the beach, where two shoppers were dawdling over some knickknacks one recent afternoon. ''Right now, on my sales floor, you shouldn't be able to move.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ottosen has laid off several workers and cut the hours of the remaining skeleton staff in half, but his sales since the spill have been barely 50 percent of last year's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Uncertainty about the coast's economic future has frozen some real estate construction deals and scotched others. Scott Shamburger, a contractor who also owns several rental properties, said he had clients cancel five construction projects worth $2 million in the weeks after the spill began, including two commercial properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shaul Zislin, who owns a beachside restaurant and two souvenir stores, sat in his mostly empty establishment recently and noted that the biggest problem was the perception that the beaches were covered with oil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The oil has washed up sporadically, city officials said, and BP had been quick in the tourist towns on Alabama's coast to send in droves of workers to clean it up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, crews have removed about 1,500 tons of oil from Gulf Shore's beaches alone, city officials said, and they have been forced to close the city's beaches for a day about once every four days since the spill began.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With money from BP, the state has done what it can to counter the impression that the beaches are covered with goo. For instance, the oil company underwrote a concert that brought in tens of thousands of people to see Jimmy Buffett, whose sister owns a restaurant in town.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the television images of oil on beaches have scared off the tourists and potential investors, Mr. Zislin said. Receipts at his souvenir businesses are down nearly 60 percent from last year, he said, and the restaurant's sales have also dropped precipitously.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The perception out there is that you get out of your car and the black oil plague is crawling up your leg,'' he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing start numbers for June show that activity remains moribund, which is hardly a surprise.&nbsp; When you build way too much of something, you get a glut that takes time to work off.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the total number of single-family housing starts is a little better than it was at the bottom in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is in apartments -- including condos -- that the bottom fell out with a vengeance.&nbsp; The total number of new apartment units started in the 12 months through June was 92,200. That is the lowest total since the government began to calculate it in 1959, and is less than half the number in the previous 12 months.&nbsp; By contrast, single family starts for last 12 months are up 7 percent from the depressed year-earlier figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What is going on?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It now appears that speculation was probably worse in multi-family buildings in many communities. And it took longer to turn off the spigot after markets collapsed.&nbsp; A big apartment project can take years to plan and complete. Some were finished well after the demand had gone, with lenders deciding that they would lose less in the long run if they had something to rent or sell, rather than a partly built eyesore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here are the national and regional total apartment starts for the most recent 12 months, for the nation and regions, and the change from the peak level in each region of the past decade.&nbsp; The West is the worse. but all regions have suffered badly.National: 92,200, down 75%</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Northeast: 15,000, down 78%</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Midwest: 19,200, down 74%</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">South: 41,600, down 76%</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">West: 15,900, down 82%This post relies on real 12-month numbers, not seasonally adjusted annual rates, because the multifamily figures are so volatile that looking at any one month can be very misleading. That said, there was a small pickup in multifamily building permits in June, which some find encouraging.&nbsp; That strikes me as premature, at best.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, I think that cranes coming down as apartment buildings are finished are likely to remain unused for a long time, particularly in areas that had the most speculative activity. My home borough of Brooklyn is among those areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Addendum: A commenter questions the arithmetic above.&nbsp; It stems from the fact that the regional peaks came at differing times from each other, and from the national peak.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Ann and Jonathan Binstock started shopping for an apartment in Manhattan in 2007, their first call was not to a real estate broker. Instead, they hired an education consultant, to show them where the best schools for their daughter, Ellen, were. After the consultant suggested the most desirable zones , they chose a two-bedroom apartment near Public School 87 on the Upper West Side. Public records show it cost $1.975 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Binstock said the family's apartment ''was a stretch financially.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We ended up buying the apartment that we live in now based on the schools,'' she added. ''All of our money is in our little two-bedroom apartment.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Ellen is entering second grade, and the Binstocks are finding that plenty of other parents shared their real estate strategy: P.S. 87 has become so overcrowded with students that, in first grade, Ellen had no gym class, and her lunch started before 11 a.m. It has a waiting list. The Binstocks heard that a neighboring school, P.S. 199, was also crowded, with its own waiting list.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Families like the Binstocks helped raise the tide of New York real estate prices in recent years by bypassing the suburbs and, instead, paying premium prices for apartments near high-performing public schools in places like TriBeCa and the Upper West Side in Manhattan, and Park Slope in Brooklyn. Developers, in turn, built costly family-size apartments near the same schools, knowing they would draw parents hoping to avoid the cost of a private education.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there were never any guarantees. Schools fill up. Zones are altered by the Department of Education, which sometimes switches the blocks that each zone comprises. Children in New York City, after all, are guaranteed a public education, but not necessarily in the school that their parents want, or in the one that is closest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building more schools goes a long way toward easing the problem, of course, but it is an expensive remedy, especially in stressed economic times. That is one reason the city often requires builders of ambitious projects to include a place that helps the public, like a school, in their plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of these issues are wrapped up in a struggle on the Upper West Side between parents like the Binstocks who want more classrooms -- many more -- and the developer of a new project who is offering to build a school that some say is not big enough. The issue -- and the emotional and financial repercussions that go with it -- resonates with families across the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The parents are pushing Extell Development, which is in the process of getting approval for its Riverside Center Development, to build an even larger school than the one it has promised. The local community board plans to vote on this project, which includes the push for the larger school, on July 22.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the school may not even be completed for six to eight years, parents want it to accommodate the young families expected to move to the neighborhood during that time. They argue that a developer who profits financially from selling apartments to families who live there for the schools should chip in more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This overcrowding has been caused to a fair extent by overbuilding,'' said Noah E. Gotbaum, president of District 3's Community Education Council, which approves zoning lines for West Side schools, including the proposed Riverside Center school. ''This school has got to be big,'' he said. ''It's got to be paid for by the developer and it's got to be among the first buildings built.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Extell Development has already offered to build a 75,000-square-foot school for 480 students for children in kindergarten through eighth grade, according to a May 3 letter from Extell to the School Construction Authority. The developer would pay to build the ''core and shell'' of the school, which is standard, and the interiors and classrooms would be paid for by the School Construction Authority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gary Barnett, Extell's president, agreed that schools had become a ''very important consideration citywide'' and that city-dwelling families valued schools as much as their suburban counterparts. But he said that the School Construction Authority was ''where we take our direction from.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Extell said it would build a school double the original size, as long as the School Construction Authority paid the additional construction costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parents say that is not big enough. They want Extell to build a school that accommodates six classes per grade or roughly 1,250 students, and they want Extell to pay for more of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rachel Laiserin, co-president of the P.S. 87 Parents Association, said that at her school the number of incoming kindergartners more than doubled, to 241 in 2010 from 93 in 2007. She added that these numbers were only going to grow, based on the growing presence of Gymborees and baby stores in the neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You literally see more strollers everywhere,'' Ms. Laiserin said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jack Zarin-Rosenfeld, a spokesman for the Department of Education, pointed out that other schools in the district that includes P.S. 87 have not even been filled yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When you look at the whole Upper West Side, you see some schools that are at capacity and some that aren't,'' he said. ''It's important that we effectively use the space we already have.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Joe Fiordaliso, the father of two girls, said the debate was more about the department delivering what it promised. His 4-year-old daughter, Camilla, is on the waiting list at P.S. 199.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Camilla has been admitted to another public school, the Fiordalisos say they hope she is accepted at P.S. 199, because her admission should make it easier for her 2-year-old sister, Rose, to go there. The family is renting a 900-square-foot apartment across the street from P.S. 199 until learning whether Camilla got off the waiting list.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Has my family sacrificed to stay in this zone? Absolutely,'' Mr. Fiordaliso said. ''When we made the decision to stay in the city, we entered into a pact with the city. That pact was that my child would go to his or her zoned school.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group</span> is taking over the management of a $2-billion-plus Bank of America-Merrill Lynch Asian real estate fund, in a deal that will close in the third quarter, according to press reports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Merrill, which had invested $700 million of its own money in the Asian Real Estate Opportunities Fund, will remain a limited partner, Reuters reported, citing sources familiar with the situation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to The Financial Times, the fund, whose main purpose is to invest in real estate assets and property companies mainly in Japan, China, South Korea and India, is valued at about $2 billion, excluding debt. Blackstone will help unwind the Merrill portfolio and will not acquire any assets from it, the newspaper said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fund had closed in late 2008, raising $2.65 billion from investors in North America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LARGE and small real estate brokerages have been videotaping properties on the market for years. But in the age of the iPad and the smartphone, two of the larger brokerages in New York -- Halstead Property and <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span> -- have made an investment in video as a marketing tool, though they differ on the best way to use it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the last two years, Halstead Property has upped the ante by creating more than 600 videos of its listings and market reports, among other things, which the company said produced 4.6 million views. Although Diane M. Ramirez, the president of Halstead, wouldn't say what the company was spending, she said the expense to the firm, and to its agents -- who pay a part of the cost of the videos out of their own marketing budgets -- had been worthwhile. ''It really is a commitment,'' she added. ''It's not something you can just dip your toe in.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Halstead has a contract with an outside provider, called FlashFrame Productions, to shoot and produce the video tours -- often narrated by the brokers -- as well as market reports, neighborhood profiles and agent biographies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Frenzer, a vice president of Halstead, was never a fan of the old-style 360-degree video tour of a real estate listing. But last fall, he was trying to sell a one-bedroom on West 89th Street that was generating little interest. Another firm had an identical apartment in the same building, but on a higher floor and with a better view, and he was afraid the other one would get all the attention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So Mr. Frenzer took advantage of Halstead's new push to video. He was taped giving a tour of the apartment, and the video, about three minutes long, was posted on Halstead's site. Soon an offer had come in from an investor in Portugal who had never seen the place (though his broker had). Then another, from a woman who had been to an open house but who had been undecided until she watched the clip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a bidding war, Mr. Frenzer had a contract at his asking price. When the deal fell through because of financing problems, there was yet another buyer who had seen the video. Mr. Frenzer said he also found at least two new clients as a result of his performance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christina Lowris-Panos, an executive vice president for marketing and advertising of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, agrees on the value of video -- just not on how to use it. ''I'd be curious to see what the success rate is in selling property through video,'' she said. ''We haven't seen that pan out in a big way.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Corcoran, she said, striking photography and accurate floor plans continue to be among the most valuable online listing features. Still, she said, the company believes in video as a branding tool. Since May 2009, it has posted dozens of clips on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>, many featuring Pamela Liebman, the chief executive, on topics ranging from market data to favorite city restaurants and iPhone apps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea, said Corcoran's online marketing director, Matthew Shadbolt, is to communicate a sense of what living in New York is about, beyond the four walls of the apartment. The <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> videos are linked through sites like <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and Twitter, he said, and company data indicate that most people who click on a clip watch until the end.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: July 25, 2010, Sunday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on July 11 about two brokerages that are using video as a marketing tool misidentified the producers of Halstead Property's videos of listings and market reports. They are produced by Halstead and FlashFrame Productions, an outside vendor -- not by WellcomeMat, which provided technical support for the videos.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The announcement on Wednesday that the powerful Durst real estate family had won a hotly contested bidding contest for a stake in 1 World Trade Center represented a remarkable turnaround in the fortunes of the $3.3 billion skyscraper since its inception six years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tower, which will stand 1,776 feet high and succeed the Empire State Building as the tallest in the city, had been scorned as a white elephant throughout its planning and the innumerable delays before construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as the tower's thick steel beams gradually rose over ground zero, the 105-story building became a much-sought-after trophy for a who's who of New York real estate figures. The developers recognized that the tower would draw international attention and become a symbol of a rejuvenated trade center and Lower Manhattan's commercial district.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the cost of building 1 World Trade Center, which was known as the Freedom Tower, is enormously high -- roughly $1,269 a square foot. It will be a challenge for both the Dursts and the <span class="companylink">Port Authority of New York and New Jersey</span>, which owns the site, to fill the cavernous 2.6 million square feet of space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are ecstatic that the Port Authority has selected us, and we are optimistic that 1 World Trade Center will join the skyline as one of New York's great buildings,'' said Jonathan Durst, president of the Durst Organization. ''We look forward to a productive and mutually beneficial partnership with the Port Authority and congratulate them on the progress they have achieved at 1 World Trade Center.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The authority's board met Wednesday and selected Durst over the other finalist, the Related Companies, one of the city's most prolific developers. The authority and the Dursts plan to negotiate a final agreement over the next 30 days. If the deal is completed, the Dursts will invest at least $100 million for an undisclosed stake in the project and take over leasing and management of the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The authority figured that it was good at building but would need an expert to lure top-notch tenants from the United States and abroad. In one of the more intriguing possibilities, the publishing giant Conde Nast has expressed interest in moving to 1 World Trade Center from a Durst building in Times Square.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're extremely pleased that some of the most prominent developers in the country saw market value in this world-class office tower, and engaged in an extremely competitive process for a stake in it,'' said Anthony R. Coscia, the authority's chairman. ''What is most important is that we reach an agreement that is good for the building, for the World Trade Center site and for the region.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, the Beijing Vantone Industrial Company, a Chinese real estate firm that signed a lease for the 64th through 69th floors, a total of about 190,000 square feet, is the sole private tenant. The authority has preliminary agreements with the state and federal governments for one million square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The authority had explored selling the building in 2007 to a private equity firm, but the recession quickly wiped out that possibility. In January, the authority solicited interest from a select group of developers who might be interested in a partnership deal. Six responded: the Durst Organization; Steven Roth, chairman of <span class="companylink">Vornado Realty Trust</span>, a national real estate company; Mortimer B. Zuckerman, chairman of Boston Properties and the owner of The Daily News; <span class="companylink">Brookfield Properties</span>, one of the largest landlords downtown; Hines, an international developer based in Texas; and Stephen M. Ross, chief executive of the Related Companies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ross expressed disappointment on Wednesday. ''I wish them the best,'' he said, ''because I realize how important this job is. It's going to need some nontraditional thinking.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal is also a remarkable reversal for the Dursts, and not the first for a member of New York's real estate royalty. Seymour Durst was a vociferous opponent of the original World Trade Center complex. And his son, Douglas, had been an outspoken critic of the Freedom Tower. Like many critics, the son said the tower was ill conceived and too expensive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Dursts, who have been eager to get into a new development project since they completed the Bank of America Tower on 42nd Street last year, recognized that it was better to get involved downtown because there would not be many office towers built in Manhattan over the next decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Durst family, which owns 10 Midtown office buildings, had also opposed the redevelopment of the Times Square area in the 1980s. It was bad policy, the Dursts argued, for government to subsidize four planned office buildings in Times Square that would compete with privately built towers along Avenue of the Americas, particularly theirs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The designated Times Square developer, George Klein, once blamed them for 46 of the 47 lawsuits that delayed redevelopment there for much of the 1980s. But in the end, it was Douglas Durst, not Mr. Klein, who built the first of the four Times Square towers -- the Conde Nast Building at 4 Times Square -- in 1996.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Michele Kleier wanted to sell a nine-room apartment at 1125 Park Avenue in 1977, her brokerage firm paid for a one-and-a-half-line classified newspaper advertisement that offered the rough location (''Park Ave. -- Low 90s'') and succinctly read ''Superb condition. Sun filled. Excel. maint.'' With that ad, she found a buyer willing to pay $145,000, today's inflationary equivalent of $522,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This spring, when Ms. Kleier wanted to sell her 45th apartment in the same building, she invited 75 brokers to the eight-room apartment for an open house and seafood lunch catered by the Atlantic Grill restaurant. She featured the apartment on the HGTV television program ''Selling New York'' and paid to have the listing prominently displayed on several influential real estate Web sites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now everybody wants to see the pictures,'' Ms. Kleier said. ''They want to know all about the building. They want to see everything. Believe me, life was a lot simpler then.'' A lot cheaper, too: On Thursday, she closed on the apartment for $4 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although New Yorkers have obsessed, haggled and boasted about Manhattan real estate since its controversial and possibly apocryphal exchange for a handful of beads four centuries ago, it is fair to say that the promotion of Manhattan apartments has exploded over the past few decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, there are more apartments to sell since the conversion of thousands of rental apartments to co-ops and the creation of the condominium market. Still, many brokers remember when apartments were bought and sold without a retinue of real estate stagers, photographers and writers fussing over these homes before their appearances on Web sites and television.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That big marketing and presentation of properties was not done,'' said Hall F. Willkie, president of Brown Harris Stevens. ''Back in the mid-'80s, in the residential real estate world, people didn't know how to spell 'marketing.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is partly because residential real estate used to be a far smaller industry. Barbara Corcoran said that when she started her brokerage firm in 1973, she tracked the city's apartments on 4-by-5-inch handwritten index cards that her brokers kept next to the coffee cart. They organized these cards by color: studios were yellow, one-bedrooms were pink, two-bedrooms were blue, and three-bedroom or larger apartments were orange.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She added that there were far fewer apartments available through her agency, most of them rentals. As a comparison, 262 apartment sales closed in Manhattan in the past three months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In those days, sales were designed so that brokers had far less incentive to advertise and promote properties. Sellers gave their apartments to multiple brokerage firms because only the broker who delivered the buyer received a commission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When you didn't have an exclusive, you didn't want to commit resources to it,'' said Kirk Henckels, the director of Stribling Private Brokerage. ''There's no certainty you're going to make money.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of course, Manhattan apartments did not carry the profits they carry today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Elise Ward, a broker now with the firm Core, started selling TriBeCa lofts to artists in 1981, so few buildings had been renovated or had soundproofing that she used words like ''fireproof'' and ''steel and concrete structure'' to mean quiet. Now, selling these apartments to the present-day TriBeCa clientele, she said, requires ''several cocktail parties'' and ''brochures, you name it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in the late 1980s, when brokers started accepting co-brokerage agreements and investing in advertising, their efforts were far more modest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1989, Pamela Nichols, a broker who now works for Prudential Douglas Elliman, received an exclusive listing to sell a one-bedroom penthouse at 2 Sutton Place South for $725,000 (the equivalent of $1.275 million today). On Oct. 8, 1989, she published a single four-line advertisement and did not provide prospective buyers with photographs before they visited.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You literally described the apartment to them on the phone,'' she said. ''Until you met them at the building, they didn't see anything.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now she is reselling the apartment for $1.65 million. After Ms. Nichols put it on the market in April, she drafted a 10-line advertisement, hired a professional photographer, designed a full-color handout and promoted the apartment in luxury publications like a Hamptons magazine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Nichols added that in many ways, selling apartments has not changed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2001, when she renovated her Westhampton beach house, she discovered that a past owner had left her a real estate time capsule beneath the porch: perfectly preserved real estate pages from a Nov. 1, 1925, issue of The New York Herald Tribune. Even then, the newspaper included advertisements for buildings like 31 East 79th Street and 1020 Fifth Avenue that emphasized that the apartments offered ''every convenience and service luxury.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You're still using the same words,'' she marveled. ''It's just the vehicle.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Providence, R.I.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN 1992, when my husband, Lorne, tried to convince me to marry him and move to Rhode Island, he took me to a big hole in downtown Providence. ''Someday,'' Lorne said with a sweep of his hand, ''there will be a beautiful river here with bridges and people.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I looked at the bulldozers and the pile of mud in front of me -- all part of a $60 million project to uncover the city's paved-over rivers -- and thought: I am never moving here. I had grown up in West Warwick, a mill town about 14 miles away, and I had left as soon as possible. Supposedly, Providence was having a renaissance. But the downtown still had mostly empty buildings and deserted streets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That night, Lorne took me to dinner at a tiny restaurant called New Rivers. Owned by Pat and Bruce Tillinghast, the two-year-old restaurant had twinkly white lights, paintings of pears and a menu that used local ingredients. When Lorne finally succeeded in wooing me to Providence, it became our place for romantic dinners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bruce, now 63, is boyish-looking despite his salt-and-pepper hair. With his tortoise-shell glasses and madras shirt, he could be a character in one of the 1950s sitcoms that he watched growing up in nearby Lincoln, where his family shared a double-decker house with his grandparents. He describes his suburban middle-class childhood as charmed, with his mother creating Halloween costumes that always won him and his sister first prize at school and his father taking him on a search for the then-unusual ingredient of leeks to make vichyssoise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He met Pat in 1974 when he was working as a waiter at <span class="companylink">Harrah's</span> in Lake Tahoe, Nev., where she was a hostess. ''Here was this absolutely gorgeous auburn-haired woman with broad, tanned shoulders -- in April! -- floating through the room,'' Bruce said. ''I was a goner at first glance.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They eventually moved to Rhode Island, married and decided to pursue Bruce's dream of opening a restaurant. A Rhode Island School of Design graduate, he had fallen in love with cooking. ''It became a new form of creativity,'' he told me. With Pat at the front of the house and Bruce in the kitchen, Providence grew to love New Rivers and the Tillinghasts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it wasn't until Pat died in 1999 that Bruce realized just how vital the restaurant was to the community. ''We built this business together and it was important not to let it slip away,'' he said. That commitment to keeping New Rivers going has been challenged again and again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I can't tell you the number of times people have asked me, 'Are you going to close?' '' Bruce said, shaking his head. They asked him that when the basement flooded in 2005 during Brown University's parents' weekend, one of the busiest times for Providence restaurants. Bruce put on a pair of waders, grabbed a flashlight and went down to retrieve wine. The flood knocked out his point of sale system and he had to handwrite all the credit card slips, only to find out two weeks later that the banks would accept only electronic transactions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They asked him again a year-and-a-half later when the kitchen caught fire and Bruce had to take out a home-equity loan to bring it up to code. That time, the restaurant was closed for six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the economy tanked in 2008, Providence restaurant owners were scratching their heads trying to figure out how to survive. That's when Bruce took the incredible leap of expanding New Rivers. He had long dreamed of moving into the space next door where a small cafe had been. ''All these windows!'' Bruce exclaimed, marveling at his renovated restaurant, which he unveiled seven months ago. Despite the still struggling economy, on a good weekend night, Bruce and his chef du cuisine, Beau Vestal, serve more than 100 dinners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On one such sultry summer evening, I sat gazing out those big windows. The steeple of the First Baptist Church shone to the east. Below was the river Lorne promised me all those years ago. On the menu, there was bluefish from Block Island Sound and blueberries from nearby Seekonk, Mass. And there was Bruce himself in his customary bow tie, blue eyes sparkling. ''It will come together again,'' he said hopefully. ''Just in a different way.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest economic indicators are bleak: the nation lost a net 125,000 jobs in June, new unemployment claims continue to rise, and home sales continue to drop. What does the economy look like around the country? The Op-Ed editors asked four writers to find out. Here are their first dispatches.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McCall, Idaho</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''THE brakes on the Volvo are screeching,'' reports my wife, a fitting way to begin a Monday. Front pads, rear pads, rear rotors: the first bid comes in at $1,234, the second at $760.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I go for a walk. ''I think that I cannot preserve my health and spirits,'' Thoreau wrote in his essay ''Walking,'' ''unless I spend four hours a day at least -- and it is commonly more than that -- sauntering through the woods and over the hills and fields absolutely free from all worldly engagements.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four hours a day? I'll have to settle for 30 minutes. Unfortunately, even in Valley County, Idaho, hiking along a forested ridge above the glittering, cloud-swept 5,000 acres of Payette Lake, worldly engagements prove hard to shake. At 14.3 percent, county unemployment is the highest in the state, foreclosure notices routinely fill five pages of the local newspaper and Tamarack, the once chic ski resort in nearby Donnelly, has been in default since 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During my half-hour stroll, it snows, then hails, then becomes fabulously, luxuriously sunny. I'm watching a wet fox sun himself on a rock, steam rising from his back, when I notice a morel mushroom, like the hat of a little forest gnome, poking up out of leaf litter. Within a minute, I've found four more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These honeycombed, wrinkled treasures are famously elusive, famously delicious -- and famously expensive. Recently, morels were selling for $15 a pound at the Capital City Public Market in Boise. Sometimes, around here, it's as high as 30 bucks a pound. That's for about only 40 medium-size mushrooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, I was standing in a shaft of sunlight seeing Volvo brakes growing from the ground; I was seeing gold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I head out the next day, and again the following weekend. I saunter through the woods and over the hills and fields; I see a wood frog in a hole, a doe curled up for a nap and a clutch of oyster mushrooms growing beneath a fallen aspen. I find exactly zero morels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Oh, they don't call morels elusive for nothing,'' Claudia Nally tells me later. She is an employee in the governor's office who has been picking mushrooms in these mountains for almost three decades. ''Some people look for years but just don't develop the eyes for them.'' Of course, two breaths later she's telling me a story about how she once found a patch of morels so big she filled a 33-gallon trash bag and had to turn her shirt into a sack to fit the rest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's my eyes, I think. I haven't developed them yet. I peer into the ground harder than ever. Do they favor ridgelines? Rotting stumps? ''I'm not sure if you have ever found a large amount of morels, but it's sort of like a gold-rush feeling,'' enthuses 27-year-old Clay Tuck, a student at Boise State University who was laid off from a factory job last August. ''Especially when you plan on selling them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On my third morel hunt, I stumble on two, each no bigger than my thumb. Maybe even the mushrooms are in a recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But on my last excursion, I discover 11 mushrooms growing among some purple trillium. Before I return home that day, I find 14 more scattered across the hillsides.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twenty-six: maybe enough for $8. My plans of becoming a mushroom millionaire will have to wait. I bring home my sackful of fungi, wash them, slice them, dunk them in beaten egg, roll them in crushed saltines and fry them in butter. My wife and I eat them outside with glasses of cold beer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They taste like pine trees, like weather, like triumph. And here's the real gift: For those afternoons that I went walking in the mountains, my eyes on the forest floor, my cellphone out of range, I felt the joy of being fully present, of paying attention to the world. For a few hours, I was finally away from oil spills and foreclosures and layoffs, free from all but the simplest of worldly engagements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest economic indicators are bleak: the nation lost a net 125,000 jobs in June, new unemployment claims continue to rise, and home sales continue to drop.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Las Cruces, N.M.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LAST year, I lost my tenure-track teaching job when the College of Santa Fe, founded in 1859, closed after years of financial risk-taking and mismanagement. I was lucky enough to land another position elsewhere in New Mexico. A few of my colleagues found jobs in places like Florida, California, Canada, Singapore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for those faculty members determined to stay in Santa Fe, the odds of finding another academic job were close to zero. The political science professor now teaches Spanish at a local high school. The music professor decided to pursue nursing. And the costume design professor, Cheryl Odom, took a job as the alterations manager at a bridal shop.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I didn't know Cheryl all that well. One of the pitfalls of joining an institution two years before it folds is a general lack of collegiality. But as others were sweating in corners, scheming ways to avoid layoffs, Cheryl was actively kind, chatting with me after meetings, shaking off the bad vibes with a flip of her long auburn hair. She joined the college in 1980 after a brief but successful costuming career in Los Angeles. A veteran of the college's constant struggle with money, she wasn't so easily undone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last year we taught there, one of my quieter students brought a piece of white satin to my office and showed me a stitch she'd learned in Cheryl's class. Not since my own college days, when a snotty redheaded costuming professor denigrated me for my shyness, had I given a thought to the craft.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But I saw then that Cheryl and I did essentially the same thing. She showed students how to make something beautiful out of ideas, patience and simple tools. Using their imaginations and some muslin, they could go from nothing to mock-up to fully rendered spectacle. She empowered them not just to make dresses but to have a vision and to execute it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vision and its execution didn't happen often in the administrative offices of the artsy College of Santa Fe. The college, which struggled for decades with its identity, had a history of selling off land to stay afloat. By the time I arrived in 2007, the ragged little campus peered out from a cluster of strip malls and banks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unable to pay a debt that hovered around $30 million, the fragile institution began courting Laureate Education, which runs for-profit universities abroad and online, hoping for a ''partnership'' (i.e., bailout). For a while, it seemed that this might work, though we'd lose things like tenure and sabbaticals, receiving instead an undefined form of ''merit pay'' and the chance to teach at Laureate's campuses worldwide. But Laureate couldn't strike a deal with the college's creditors -- so the problematic, idealistic school finally closed last May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last summer, the city finally figured out a deal that allowed Laureate to lease the land and buildings, without taking responsibility for pesky things like tenured faculty or the huge debt. The college reopened as a for-profit art school and in August will be renamed the Santa Fe University of Art and Design; a handful of faculty members now teach about 200 hundred of the original 700 students.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I spoke to Cheryl on the phone recently. She explained that the chairman of the theater department couldn't hire back everyone and, forced to choose, decided to focus on acting and performing. ''At first I was angry,'' she said. ''I spent 29 years at that college. I designed over 100 shows, made more than a half-million-dollars worth of costumes. I put my child through school there. But now, I'm over it. I'm O.K.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She's 60 now, and when she applied for health insurance, she was denied. A part-time gig at the local community college allows her to keep mentoring the next generation of artists, but it can't pay her bills or her mortgage. So Cheryl looked through the classified ads. ''My son graduated from the College of Santa Fe on a Saturday,'' she said. ''I was working at <span class="companylink">David's Bridal</span> on Monday.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They love me at the bridal shop,'' she told me. ''They're thrilled by how fast I can work and how happy I make my customers.'' Her brides are about the same age as most of her former students, so she still gets to be part of a young person's transformation, though admittedly, it's a very different job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When I asked her if the alterations are ever artistically fulfilling, she explained that the dresses are all under copyright; there's not much you can do to add flair. It's nothing like the pirate costumes, flapper dresses and tailored men's suits that are bagged up in a storage unit somewhere on campus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, she specializes in fancy bustles. She can work with the bones, the beadwork, the crinoline. ''Some of the trains are so long, it's like a white-out under there. But I know how to work with all that,'' she said. ''And I get the hugs and the tears.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest economic indicators are bleak: the nation lost a net 125,000 jobs in June, new unemployment claims continue to rise, and home sales continue to drop. What does the economy look like around the country? The Op-Ed editors asked four writers to find out. Here are their first dispatches.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A In my first year I've closed over 12 transactions -- I take on only a few clients at a time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I just completed a 26,000-square-foot sublease for Atlantic Philanthropies, one of the largest foundations in our country. Atlantic Philanthropies had excess space at 125 Park; they had moved to Varick Street. We ended up renting it to the New York Blood Center. This is my biggest deal so far. But I'm working on three other deals in that size of 20,000 to 30,000 feet, which are in various levels of closing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Are you profitable yet?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A When I started my company, I put a certain amount of money in to take a small office and pay for ongoing expenses, and I would say that I've paid myself back and made some money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I've also given some money away. When I close a deal, I'll donate a portion of my fees -- from 10 to 50 percent -- that I get from the landlords to the nonprofit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Clearly you could be earning more outside this niche. Why the focus on the nonprofit sector?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A My father was a physician, and when I was 13 I made house calls and hospital rounds with him. My mother was the first employee of Donald Trump and also the finance chair for Gov. Hugh Carey, and really a pioneer in terms of women and real estate. And so I had a dual life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I had this life with my mother where I worked on all of Donald's development sites, and as she went into her own business, I worked with her. That was very exciting, but there was something that felt empty about it. I really loved the fulfillment that I felt around my father, in terms of serving and saving lives. So I decided early on that I needed to bring these two things together in my career.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Does your mother support you in this decision?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Well, my whole life my mother did try to pull me into her company. But I think that my mother was very independent herself, and I think greatly respects that I'm independent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Your mom is renowned in the industry for her marketing skills, particularly in luxury property. What have you learned from her?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A I met a lot of developers through her and I watched her on the landlord side create value through fantastic marketing programs. I also learned about closing a deal: there was nothing that came before getting a deal closed with my mother. I would consider my mother absolutely a mentor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Are there more deals going on with nonprofit groups now?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Every nonprofit I know is looking at their real estate, whether it's owned or leased, to figure out how to take advantage of the low prices. They tend to want to be in Class B or C buildings in secondary markets, where the pricing has really suffered. So it's a great time to renew and it's a great time to relocate. In some cases, I've been able to negotiate nonprofits' staying in the same building, cutting back space and cutting rent in half. I'm seeing a tremendous amount of compassion -- you might call it concessions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q What kind of rental rates are they looking to pay?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Right now my nonprofits are looking for rents between $28 and $35 a foot -- actually $45, when you include the foundations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Have these groups been hurt much by the weak economy?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A It's not an easy time. Consumers have more debt, so they have less to spend on philanthropy. Foundations have lost value in their endowments, so they've cut back on funding. That said, nonprofits were formed during hard times. That's why I call them countercyclical: They tend to want to expand during these times, because they have more work to do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Is there a story behind the Sunshine family name?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A The Sunshine name is really my name. I believe it might have had another iteration when the family immigrated over from Russia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q It's a cool last name.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A It's a warm last name.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stocks fell Thursday as manufacturing and labor market data heightened fears of a double-dip recession before Friday's crucial employment report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Major indexes were lower for a fourth consecutive day after suffering their worst quarter since late 2008, but losses eased near the end of the session.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Right now everyone is so concerned about a major 'potential depression' or deflation taking place. It's really roiling the market,'' said Paul Mendelsohn, chief investment strategist at Windham Financial Services in Charlotte, Vt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 41.49 points, or 0.42 percent, to 9,732.53. The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span> 500-stock index shed 3.34 points, or 0.32 percent, to 1,027.37. The Nasdaq composite index lost 7.88 points, or 0.37 percent, to 2,101.36.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a Reuters survey, economists expected Friday's Labor Department report on June nonfarm payrolls to show a decline of 110,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gold mining company stocks were among the hardest hit on Thursday after being one the few strong sectors in the second quarter as the price of gold fell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barrick Gold fell 5.1 percent to $43.06 and <span class="companylink">Newmont Mining</span> slid 4.5 percent to $58.99. The PHLX gold/silver sector index fell 4.4 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spot gold price was down $43.30, to $1,198.95 an ounce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What you are seeing is clearly a nervous feeling about all assets, whether they be tangible or intangible, paper or not. The overall mood is bearish, and metals may not be the safe haven that you can just bank on,'' said Scott Meyers, senior analyst at Pioneer Futures, which is based in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indicators suggested equity markets were oversold, but fears of a worse-than-expected jobs report, exacerbated by Thursday's jobless claims data, kept buyers on the sidelines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thursday's data also included the Institute for Supply Management's barometer of manufacturing activity, which fell to its lowest level since December, and pending home sales, which dropped a record 30 percent in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other data showed unemployment claims rose unexpectedly last week, heightening fears a labor market recovery was stalling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another report, the National Association of Realtors said its index of pending home sales fell in May after the government tax credit for home buyers expired. The index for contracts signed in May fell by 30 percent, to 77.6, down from 110.9 in April. The index is down nearly 16 percent from where it stood in May 2009, the association said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline reversed three months of increases, as home buyers rushed to make use of the tax credit, put in place as part of a government stimulus measure to address the housing crisis. The May figure was also the lowest since the association started tracking such contract activity as a forward-looking indicator in 2001.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Automakers posted a decline in sales in June from the month earlier, though the figures were higher than June 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Ford Motor</span>, up 4.9 percent to $10.57, was one of the bright spots after the automaker reported June sales had gained 15 percent over June 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With increased worries about the trajectory of the economy, investors turned to Treasuries as a safe haven and interest rates were lower most of the session. But as stocks erased their worst losses near the close, Treasuries declined. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 5/32, to 104 22/32, and the yield rose to 2.95 percent from 2.93 percent late Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The euro rallied to a five-week high above $1.25 on Thursday, before falling back slightly to $1.2480 in late trading in New York. The dollar also fell against other currencies after the disappointing economic data heightened worries that the economic recovery is stalling in the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Concerns about euro zone debt and liquidity problems eased further on Thursday after Spain successfully sold 3.5 billion euros of a five-year bond, adding to positive sentiment a day after European banks borrowed less money than expected from a European Central Bank tender.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thinning liquidity ahead of the long Independence Day weekend in the United States exacerbated moves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a relief rally in the euro because we have gotten through the euro zone market events over the past 48 hours,'' said Amelia Bourdeau, senior currency strategist at <span class="companylink">UBS</span> in Stamford, Conn. ''The euro zone seemed to navigate those events successfully.''</p>

</div><div class="author">By CHRISTINE HAUSER </div><div>909 words</div><div>2 July 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A record drop in pending home sales and a slowdown in the construction market contributed to a sluggish outlook for the economy Thursday, highlighting the significance of government stimulus measures and job growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The economic indicators were the latest features that economists and analysts used to gauge the pace of the economic recovery. But all eyes are on the monthly employment figures scheduled for release Friday, which are expected to show a net loss of 125,000 nonfarm payroll jobs in June, and an unemployment rate of 9.8 percent, compared with 9.7 percent in May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to new statistics, pending homes sales and construction both declined in May. In addition, figures showed that while manufacturers recorded some gains in June, the pace of activity in that sector slowed last month compared with May and also came in slightly below estimates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The idea of a growth slowdown in the second half of 2010, a long-held belief of ours, is catching on as the data increasingly reinforces this idea,'' said Dan Greenhaus, the chief economic strategist for Miller Tabak &amp;Company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reflecting on the housing figures, the National Association of Realtors' chief economist, Lawrence Yun, said in a statement that job creation was one of the critical elements that would determine whether the housing market could grow without federal stimulus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The association said its index, which tracks pending home sales, fell in May, after the government tax credit for home buyers expired. The index for contracts signed in May fell by 30 percent, to 77.6, down from 110.9 in April. The index is down nearly 16 percent from where it stood in May 2009, the association said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decline reversed three months of increases, as home buyers rushed to make use of the tax credit, put in place as part of a government stimulus measure to address the housing crisis. The May figure was also the lowest since the association started tracking such contract activity as a forward-looking indicator in 2001.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The key test on whether the housing market can stand on its own without stimulus medicine will depend critically on private sector job creation in the second half of the year,'' Mr. Yun said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The association said the rush of home buyers who signed contracts by April had delayed many of the closings, and the extra time it takes to process short sales has also slowed the process. As a result, as many as 180,000 buyers who signed contracts by April 30 could have missed the June 30 deadline to complete the sale and qualify for the credit, the association said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But on Wednesday night, Congress approved legislation to extend the closing deadline until Sept. 30, meaning that buyers now have an extra three months to complete their purchases and therefore qualify for up to $8,000 in federal tax credits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Demand has fallen off a cliff in the wake of the tax credit expiration,'' said Mike Larson, real estate and interest rate analyst at Weiss Research, in a research note. ''And with so many Americans unemployed or underemployed, the housing market is going to keep hurting,'' he added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ahead of the main jobs figures, a weekly employment indicator was no cause for optimism. Initial claims for unemployment benefits were higher last week, the second time in three weeks, the Labor Department said Thursday, a sign that layoffs are rising. It said new claims for jobless benefits rose by 13,000 to a seasonally adjusted 472,000. Analysts had expected a small decline, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The construction sector will also depend on the labor market. Spending on construction in May fell just slightly, declining 0.2 percent after a 2.3 percent rise in April, the Commerce Department said. Analysts had forecast a 0.5 percent decline for May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private, nonresidential spending fell 0.6 percent after a 0.8 percent rise the month before. Construction spending on new homes and apartments shrank 0.4 percent in May after a 5.0 percent spike in April. Public projects outlays increased 0.4 percent in May after rising 1.6 percent in April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manufacturing has been one of the few bright spots in the economic recovery. In a survey representing 18 manufacturing industries, the Institute for Supply Management found that employment was still expanding in the sector but the rate of that growth slowed in June by about 2 percentage points compared with May.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thomas J. Duesterberg, chief executive of the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, said that the institute's statistics suggested there was anticipation that jobs would grow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''How much growth depends on what starts to happen in the next few months,'' he said. ''We need to see some further support from things like construction, consumer spending, and we are a little nervous about the export picture over all because Europe is weak an there are some early signs that China is slowing down.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, the index used to measure manufacturing shrank by 3.5 percentage points to 56.2 in June, mainly because orders and production slowed down, the ISM said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once dominant, and then dormant, commercial real estate loans are beginning to show signs of life on the trading floor after a two-year slump, Jotham Sederstrom reports in The New York Times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Attracted by more conservative underwriting and the perceived bottoming-out of property values, banks like <span class="companylink">J. P. Morgan Chase</span> and the <span class="companylink">Royal Bank of Scotland</span> are returning to the commercial mortgage-backed securities market, albeit cautiously.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Compared to a year or two ago we've come a long, long way," said Ross Moore, an executive vice president of the real estate services firm Colliers International. "The fact there's even discussions taking place - that's a big step forward. Are we making progress toward restarting the C.M.B.S. market? Yes, I think absolutely."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the bubble burst, nearly half of all commercial real estate deals were financed by loans related to mortgage-backed securities. As a lending instrument, they allow banks to remove loans from their balance sheets by bundling them into a diversified pool, which is then issued as a bond. The payments collected from the sales are put toward future real estate loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the peak in 2007, more than $230 billion in commercial mortgage-backed securities were originated in the United States, according to data provided by Colliers International. But with eroding property values and an inactive real estate market, new issues plunged to $12 billion the following year and to just $3 billion in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the beginning of June, there have been eight issues of commercial mortgage-backed securities, amounting to an estimated $5 billion in loans, real estate analysts said. As much as $10 billion in commercial mortgage-backed deals are expected to be completed by the end of the year, said Marielle Jan de Beur, a managing director for structured products research at <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo Securities</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the majority of the deals so far have been single-borrower issuances, a $716 million origination by <span class="companylink">J.P. Morgan Chase</span> earlier this month was backed by 36 loans on 96 assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">The Royal Bank of Scotland</span>, meanwhile, issued a $309.7 million offering in April. Comprising six loans on a total of 81 properties, it was the first multiple borrower bond of its kind since 2008, experts said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A lot of this is being driven by the financing that is coming back into the commercial real estate market," said Brian Lancaster, a market expert at the <span class="companylink">Royal Bank of Scotland</span>. "That said, the market is still what I would call very bifurcated."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Well-tenanted properties in large cities like New York are receiving financing at low rates while some Class B buildings in smaller cities are losing value and struggling to secure loans, Mr. Lancaster and other analysts said. As a result, lenders with an eye toward future commercial securities are chasing a small pool of quality properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It really is a tale of two markets," said Spencer Levy, a senior managing director at <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>. "There are those assets that have strong cash flow and there are those that don't. Those that do will find a home in today's market and have a robust relationship with lenders, insurance companies and conduits. And those that don't, it's almost as if you're seeing them fall off a cliff."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The response by investors has been positive, with demand for most of the commercial mortgage-backed issues exceeding supply, analysts said. Lenders attribute the success to conservative underwriting standards that did not exist in 2007, when loans were aggressively made based on projected income streams rather than a property's current cash flow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some lenders also praised the government's Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility program, or TALF, which helped propel the securities markets by providing equity and debt capital to lenders. That program ended earlier this month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That helped the balance sheets of both lenders and investors in terms of their loans and so it's been really positive," said Lisa A. Pendergast, president of the CRE Finance Council, a real estate finance trade association. "I think now you're finally at a point where you can kind of be comfortable with your balance sheet and your portfolio."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The success of the <span class="companylink">J. P. Morgan</span> and <span class="companylink">Royal Bank of Scotland</span> deals has already prompted competitors like <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo Securities</span>, <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> and <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> to cultivate commercial real estate loans for coming C.M.B.S. offerings, said John D. Lyons, president of the United States division of Savills, the real estate company based in London.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like <span class="companylink">J. P. Morgan Chase</span> and the <span class="companylink">Royal Bank of Scotland</span>, both of which had smaller investment groups as partners, many lenders are combining their portfolios with those of other institutions in an effort to move commercial mortgage-backed deals out into the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These lenders are beginning to make and warehouse loans because they believe that securitization has become viable again, although tentative, and will certainly be a preferred outlet for them to raise additional capital," Mr. Lyons said. He added that his firm was raising about $1.5 billion in financing on behalf of his domestic and foreign clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marcus Giancaterino, a managing director at <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span>, indicated that the big banking company was also poised to re-enter the commercial mortgage-backed market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's fairly certain that all of the banks that were historically in this business will go back into this business if they haven't already," Mr. Giancaterino said. "And I think you'll see more activity similar to what we've seen in the past few months."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EVEN in today's uncertain real estate market, family-size apartments are having something of a baby boom in New York City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of three- and four-bedroom apartments swelled last year, even as sales of smaller places declined, and the trend has since persisted. The increased sales are another sign that New York City has become a more appealing place for families. In addition, prices for these apartments have decreased more significantly than those for smaller units, and so are now more affordable for more people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Large family apartments have always been a small segment of the housing market, but the number has grown as developers have started to build more of them. Within the last year, developers of several new projects have responded to the demand by combining units to produce as many as seven bedrooms, seven and a half bathrooms and close to 6,000 square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response to buyer requests at Manhattan House, a condo conversion on East 66th Street, the developer recently created five new layouts for three to five bedrooms, said Anne Young, the building's senior sales manager. ''Last year people wanted studios and one-bedrooms,'' she said, ''but the buyer for big apartments has definitely come back to the marketplace.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers and marketing agents say that these new buildings are attractive to families who want a suburban floor plan within the confines of a Manhattan apartment. New construction is often a better option than classic prewar co-ops, which can be difficult to reconfigure with a spacious family kitchen or a rambling master suite.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buyers of these apartments, which range in price from $2.5 million to $7 million, are not typically people with five or six children; they tend to have two to four. But they want a bedroom for each child as well as a guest room, a family room or a home office. Maintenance or common charges for these larger apartments range from about $3,000 a month, for a three-bedroom, to $6,500 a month for a seven-bedroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Empty nesters moving to the city from the suburbs form another category of large-apartment buyers. Unwilling to give up the space they're used to, they want room for visiting children or grandchildren.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They, too, are finding that since median prices for larger apartments have dropped by as much as 34 percent, they need not squeeze into a one- or two-bedroom. The median for three-bedroom apartments was $3.79 million at the market's height in 2008, and dropped to $2.515 million in April and May, according to market data provided by Prudential Douglas Elliman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The new Bergen County or Westchester County is now the West Village and the Upper West or Upper East Sides,'' said Darren Sukenik, a managing director at Prudential Douglas Elliman who sold about a dozen large apartments at Superior Ink, a luxury development in the West Village. ''Big families are back, and nobody wants to move to suburbia,'' he said. ''It's the antithesis of what our parents did.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His empty-nest clients, he said, are relocating ''because 60 is the new 40, and when their kids are grown, they don't want to be stuck in the suburbs with nothing to do.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last summer Irene and Oleg Davie moved into a five-bedroom apartment at 255 East 74th Street with their son, now 11; their infant daughter; two Havanese dogs; a live-in nanny; and a live-in housekeeper. ''It's an amazing thing to have an apartment big enough for all of that,'' Ms. Davie said. They paid just under $7 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their apartment's most appealing feature is its 1,000-square-foot kitchen. ''Not even many houses have kitchens that big,'' Ms. Davie said. ''The kitchen is a very important room for the family. When I'm making dinner, we have homework going on, building blocks, the dogs -- everything is in that space.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Davies' broker, Victoria Shtainer, a senior vice president of Prudential Douglas Elliman, said that while sales for larger apartments slowed in early 2009, open-house traffic and apartment sales picked up last summer and have held steady this year. Other brokers report the same thing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When sales started at the Davies' building in early 2008, it was marketed as a ''Manhattan residence building that will redefine family living.'' Seventy percent of its apartments were to have three or more bedrooms, but as sales began, the percentage grew to 75.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We had a hunch from the beginning that this neighborhood would have a strong demand for family-size units,'' said Richard Lebow, the marketing and sales director for the developer, the World Wide Group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As with many new developments in late 2008 and early 2009 when the recession took hold, sales there froze and some buyers pulled out. But there was a thaw a year ago and now the building is nearly sold out, Mr. Lebow said. ''Our prices, at $1,800 to $2,000 per square foot, tell me there's still a shortage of large apartments,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 1,200 three- and four-bedroom units sold in 2009, nearly double the 670 that sold in 2008 and significantly more than the 830 that sold in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market for two-bedrooms has suffered as a result. They usually make up 40 percent of all apartments sold, but late last year their market share dropped as low as 25 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, the market share for three- and four-bedrooms rose from 10 percent to a high of 19 percent in the third quarter of 2009 and is now at 18 percent, according to Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel and the author of Elliman's market reports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many growing families want more space so that each of the children can have a bedroom, said Louise Phillips Forbes, an executive vice president of Halstead Property. ''People feel their children need to have space to go to where they can close their door and do their work undisturbed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Families are also looking ahead. Instead of finding an apartment that will suit them for four or five years, they want a place that will suffice for 10 years or more, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two years ago Ms. Forbes and her husband, Christopher, created a four-bedroom duplex in a prewar building on the Upper West Side. She said that this was where they intended to raise their two sons, now 6 and 4.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I want my children to have the cultural diversity that the city offers and the ability to go downstairs for a play date in their pajamas when they want,'' she said. ''And I'm grateful to have that quality of life while still having the house feeling that I grew up with.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Related Companies, which built Superior Ink, initially underestimated the demand for large apartments in the West Village, and also on the Upper East Side at the Brompton, its 22-story building on 85th Street, and the Upper West Side at the Harrison, on 76th Street. In all three buildings, Related ended up combining apartments to create more family-size units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Brompton, the number of apartments fell to 163 from 193; one unit grew to six bedrooms and 5,800 square feet. Many of the buyers were young families capable of paying $2 million to $5 million, said Susan M. de Franca, the president of Related Sales. ''When you go into the building now, you feel a real sense of community, with young families that are socializing together and nannies who hang out together, as if they're living in a suburban cul-de-sac.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tim and Marla Brown considered prewar co-ops and new condos on the Upper East Side before buying the three-bedroom three-bath unit that they moved into last week at the Brompton.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The prewar co-ops were significantly cheaper per square foot than new construction,'' said Mr. Brown, a financial trader. But the Browns, who have children aged 2, 5, and 7, had just moved from Los Angeles, where they lived in a new house. ''So moving into something that was pristine and new was important to us.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Related created their apartment by combining a two-bedroom with a studio, giving them not only three bedrooms, but also a home office and an enormous walk-in closet that Mr. Brown calls ''our New York City garage.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While combinations at the Brompton were designed to accommodate families, the demographic at Superior Ink is more diverse and has included celebrities like the actress Hilary Swank and the designer Marc Jacobs, and high-powered businessmen like Matthew Blank, the chairman of Showtime Networks. The number of units there has shrunk to 53 from a planned 74.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One Superior Ink buyer, Ms. de Franca said, was ''a young single gentleman'' who combined three apartments to create a 4,900-square-foot pied-a-terre. She said the place had ''an incredible 2,800 square feet of outdoor space, and he plans to do a lot of entertaining there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gary Barnett, the president of Extell Development, said large apartments in his buildings were also selling to individuals. ''It's not just families,'' he said, ''but also wealthy buyers who have good net worth.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Barnett has combined apartments at two new buildings, the Rushmore, at Riverside Boulevard and 64th Street, and the Lucida, at Lexington and 85th. With two-bedrooms selling for $2.5 million and three-bedrooms for $4 million, Mr. Barnett said, ''these are not inexpensive apartments, and people at that range want to live graciously.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To that end, extra bedrooms have been turned into offices or media rooms, or combined to create luxurious master suites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miller, the appraiser, said that the number of families opting to stay in the city had been growing since 2000, despite the economic woes brought about by the collapse of <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> in September 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What wasn't anticipated,'' he said, ''was that post-Lehman we would be having a conversation now about increased demand for luxury properties, given all the problems with jumbo mortgages and economy-induced austerity.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Julie Friedman, an executive vice president of Bellmarc Realty, says that many people can now buy what was unattainable three years ago. One of her clients held back on buying a large pied-a-terre for several years because he thought prices were high. Then, last summer, he bought a three-bedroom in an Art Deco building for $3.2 million, significantly less than the 2008 asking price of $4.995 million. ''It was as if someone had handed him a 'Buy Now' card from the heavens,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The large-apartment market is made up of ''very prudent buyers,'' said Tristan Harper, a senior vice president of Prudential Douglas Elliman. ''Most of them are confident they can get financing, or they'll pay cash to get an apartment and then finance later on down the road.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His clients Debra and Jason Heller live with their two children in a four-bedroom in a postwar building on the Upper West Side. Armed with a budget of almost $4 million, they are looking for more space and more charm. Apartments in most new developments are out of their price range, but many prewar apartments don't quite suit their needs, either.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've seen these grand and gorgeous foyers and beautiful formal dining rooms,'' Ms. Heller said, ''but from a practical I-have-a-young-family-in-New-York-City perspective, what's going to happen in these spaces?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What they would like is a place with a large kitchen and a great room. ''When you have young kids, it's great to have space for everyone,'' she said. ''But you want to be near them, too, when you're cooking dinner.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They're hopeful of finding this suburban sensibility in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: July 4, 2010, Sunday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about the market for large apartments in New York City misstated the street number for the building on East 74th Street where Irene and Oleg Davie recently bought a five-bedroom apartment. It is at 255 East 74th -- not 225.</p>
