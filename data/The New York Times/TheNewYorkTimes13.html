<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo, declaring his candidacy for governor of New York, could not have been clearer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The influence of lobbyists and their special interests must be drastically reduced with new contribution limits,'' Mr. Cuomo said last month. ''We will be taking on very powerful special interests which have much to lose. We must change systems and cultures long in the making.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as he delivered his announcement, Mr. Cuomo was sitting on millions in campaign cash from the very special interests whose influence he said he wanted to limit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An analysis by The New York Times shows that of the estimated $7.1 million that the Cuomo campaign has received from political action committees, associations, limited liability corporations and other entities, more than half has come from the biggest players in Albany: organized labor, the real estate and related industries like construction, the health care sector and lobbying firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the spirit of reform, Mr. Cuomo pledged in 2007 not to accept donations over $10,000 from most categories of contributors during an election cycle. But he did not stick to that vow and has at times received amounts five times as great.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The donations underscore the awkwardness of Mr. Cuomo's effort to run against Albany and its insiders at the same time he is benefiting from their largess and, in some cases, his long relationships with them. He drew a similar proportion of his campaign money from special interests in his failed 2002 campaign for governor and his 2006 bid for attorney general.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, declined repeated requests to be interviewed for this article. But an adviser, Phil Singer, said the attorney general had consistently demonstrated his independence from special interests and others who contribute to his campaign. As of its last campaign filing, the Cuomo campaign had about $16 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Any donor who could possibly think they are buying anything other than good government is delusional and blind to all facts,'' Mr. Singer wrote in an e-mail message.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He cited a number of cases in which the attorney general's office had taken action against those who had made political donations to Mr. Cuomo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The analysis by The Times shows that in the current election cycle, lobbying firms and companies that have registered to lobby on their own behalf have given Mr. Cuomo about $555,000 in donations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Organized labor, long regarded by Democrats and Republicans as perhaps the most powerful force in Albany lawmaking, has given him more than $1.4 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate and construction interests have donated more than $1.3 million, and the health care industry has contributed about $570,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As attorney general, Mr. Cuomo has undertaken several major initiatives that have coincided with interests of those donors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2007, Mr. Cuomo's office opened an investigation into whether health insurers were systematically overcharging patients who used doctors and hospitals outside the insurers' networks. The inquiry was related to an earlier federal lawsuit whose plaintiffs included the Medical Society of the State of New York, which represents physicians, medical residents and medical students; New York State United Teachers, a union; and the Civil Service Employees Association union, all of which have given generously to him through their political action committees. In 2009, he announced a settlement to shut down the payment system used by the industry and establish an independent database to replace it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also in 2007, during New York City's real estate boom, Mr. Cuomo, after receiving complaints from real estate officials, pushed for passage of a state bill to increase financing for his office to speed up the approval process for co-op and condominium conversions and ease a backlog. The measure was written into the state budget the next year with the blessing of the industry and other stakeholders and also allowed the office to better handle complaints against developers over construction flaws.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Singer pointed out that the attorney general had also aggressively pursued some of his contributors. His office reached an agreement in 2009 with WellPoint, the nation's largest health insurer, to pay $10 million toward an overhaul of the health care reimbursement system. This year, Mr. Singer said, Mr. Cuomo's office sued <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> and two of its former top officers, saying they had duped shareholders and the federal government to complete a merger with <span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span>. This month, the office sued a developer, Yair Levy, saying he stole $7.4 million from a reserve fund of a troubled downtown luxury building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Singer also said the campaign required prospective donors to show that they had no matters pending before the attorney general's office and had not had any in the previous 90 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Times review did not examine donations from individuals, like health care executives or union leaders. But an analysis conducted by the New York Public Interest Research Group recently found that 20 percent of the money Mr. Cuomo's current campaign committee received from individuals came from people working in real estate or as lobbyists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representatives of several organizations that gave to Mr. Cuomo said it was natural that their agendas sometimes dovetailed with his. They said they believed that Mr. Cuomo was right on many of the most important issues affecting their clients or constituents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, pointed to a settlement that the attorney general's office reached in July 2009 with the owners and former owners of two Brooklyn supermarkets. They were forced to pay $1.1 million for underpaying workers and violating other state labor laws.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of what Andrew has done as attorney general,'' said Mr. Appelbaum, whose group gave Mr. Cuomo $27,000 through a political action committee, ''has involved going after employers who have not paid legal wages or overtime or have mistreated employees in other ways.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">George W. Reilly, business manager of Plumbers Local Union No. 1, which gave $29,500 through its political action committee, said Mr. Cuomo's tenure as assistant secretary and then secretary at the Department of Housing and Urban Development had made him more knowledgeable about issues important to the union's members.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The political action committees that are among Mr. Cuomo's largest labor contributors include the Sergeants Benevolent Association of the New York Police Department, which gave $54,000; the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, which contributed more than $53,000; and Local 32BJ of the Service Employees International Union, which gave $45,500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lobbyists, meanwhile, continue to contribute generously to Mr. Cuomo despite three campaigns in which he has criticized their influence. During his failed bid for governor in 2002, Mr. Cuomo called New York ''the Wild West of lobbying'' and proposed a ban on contributions by lobbyists to campaigns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James D. Featherstonhaugh, a well-known lobbyist in Albany, said he had written Mr. Cuomo ''a personal check for $10,000 a month or so ago.'' Mr. Featherstonhaugh's law firm has contributed $19,873 to the campaign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Political contributions by lobbyists can be the currency of access to a governor and an administration, but several lobbyists who were willing to discuss their giving to Mr. Cuomo said they had donated because of relationships spanning two decades or so. Mr. Featherstonhaugh, whose firm has represented the New York State Academy of Trial Lawyers, <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> and the <span class="companylink">Metropolitan Life Insurance Company</span>, does not take umbrage at Mr. Cuomo's statements about lobbyists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I hope what he is saying is not that we should get rid of lobbyists,'' Mr. Featherstonhaugh said, ''but that we should reform a system that people find offensive because in some instances lobbyists exert an unfair or disproportionate influence on how government works.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kenneth L. Shapiro, managing partner of the Albany office of the law firm Wilson Elser Moskowitz Edelman &amp;Dicker L.L.P., is also not put off by Mr. Cuomo's remarks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''No one feels good about it, but we are big boys and big girls,'' said Mr. Shapiro, who has known Mr. Cuomo since the early 1980s. ''You take your shots.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We contribute to him,'' he added, ''because in our business you have to believe in somebody, and at a perilous time like this in the state, we badly need someone who can lead us out of it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A political action committee of Mr. Shapiro's firm and the partnership itself -- whose clients have included the Atlantic Yards Development Company, <span class="companylink">Consolidated Edison</span>, the New York State Hospitality and Tourism Association and numerous hospitals -- has contributed about $59,200 to the Cuomo campaign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Cuomo has drawn a considerable amount of political money from the health care industry, including doctors' groups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''He has a good track record making sure that insurers treat doctors and patients fairly,'' said Moe Auster, an in-house lobbyist for the Medical Society of the State of New York, a nonprofit advocacy group with about 30,000 members. Its political arm has given $50,793 to Mr. Cuomo's campaign, making it his second-largest health care donor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Medical groups also applauded a 2008 agreement that the attorney general reached with <span class="companylink">Excellus BlueCross BlueShield</span> and <span class="companylink">CareCore National</span> to streamline pre-approvals for tests ordered by doctors. Those specializing in cancer, for instance, no longer had to obtain approval for CAT scans, a test frequently used for cancer patients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other big health care donors to the Cuomo campaign include Physicians' Reciprocal Insurers, which has given $45,000, and the political action committee of the New York State Dental Association, which contributed $24,532.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Little attention has been paid to Mr. Cuomo's abandonment of his 2007 pledge to accept no donations of more than $10,000 per election cycle -- about 18 percent of what state law allows -- from individuals, unions, political action committees and trade associations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Times analysis shows that Mr. Cuomo's campaign has accepted donations far beyond that limit many times. He took in $55,900 from the political arm of Local 6 of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International Union and $55,900 from the political action committee of the New York State Association of Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Singer wrote in an e-mail message that in 2007, the governor at the time, Eliot Spitzer, had voluntarily limited his own campaign contributions, and that Mr. Cuomo had decided to do so in solidarity with him while a campaign finance bill was being promoted for passage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''After the bill failed and the governor resumed following the existing law, the Cuomo campaign did the same,'' Mr. Singer said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Albany, of course, is known for turning promises on campaign finance into something far more complicated. During his campaign for governor, Mr. Spitzer talked vigorously about reforming the state's campaign finance laws, and yet he exploited loopholes by accepting donations from limited liability corporations set up by individuals who could legally circumvent contribution caps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''New York's campaign finance system is horribly broken,'' Mr. Singer said, ''a disservice to the public and a burden on the candidate who must raise money to compete.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''To be in public service today,'' he also wrote, ''one must either raise money as carefully and as diligently as possible or be a multimillionaire who can self-finance. Many people, including Andrew Cuomo, simply do not have the latter option.''</p>

</div><div class="author">By JULIE SATOW </div><div>1089 words</div><div>23 June 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new accounting standard is taking shape that could change the way tenants choose to lease space, with broad consequences for the commercial real estate market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Financial Accounting Standards Board, which sets American standards, has been working with the International Accounting Standards Board to merge its generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, with international standards. One major piece of the puzzle is the accounting for leases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two boards have come up with a new standard, which will be completed next year and enacted in 2013, that will require companies to book leases as assets and liabilities on their balance sheets. Currently, American and foreign companies list many leases as footnotes in their financial statements. As a result of the change, public companies will have to put some $1.3 trillion in leases on their balance sheets, according to estimates by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Because many private companies also follow GAAP accounting, the number could be closer to $2 trillion, experts said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is going to get ugly,'' said Mindy Berman, a managing director of corporate capital markets at the real estate services company <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>. ''On the day the standard gets implemented, all these companies will suddenly have to record much higher rent, and they are going to have to record this as a significant liability on their balance sheet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There will be no grandfathering clause when the rule takes effect, so any active lease will have to be recorded on the balance sheet. Companies will record as a liability the cost of rent over the remaining term of the lease and record as an asset their right to use the space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This could have several implications, including weakening companies in the eyes of investors and activating debt covenants with lenders. It could also affect credit ratings. While ratings agencies say they already take into consideration rent obligations, the new standard requires additional disclosures that could shed new light on lease terms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The accounting change is meant to stop ''significant off-balance-sheet activity for leases,'' said Russell G. Golden, the technical director of FASB. The board expects to issue a new draft document outlining the changes this summer. This follows a months-long period in which nearly 300 companies sent letters commenting on the proposal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among those most heavily affected by the changes will be companies that are already struggling under heavy debt loads, as well as large retailers that have hundreds, if not thousands, of leases. Commercial banks with multiple branches may also be severely hit in 2013, especially if that industry is still recovering from the recession.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are busy preparing clients to make them aware of the changes and help them analyze how it might impact them,'' said Barry M. Gosin, chief executive at Newmark <span class="companylink">Knight Frank</span>, the real estate services firm. ''There are so many complicating factors that will make this an administrative nightmare.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new standard is expected to have ripple effects in the leasing market. One of the chief changes is to remove many of the differences in the way companies account for property that they own and property they lease. This may cause more companies to buy their offices and drive down demand for leased space, experts said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There may also be an impetus to shrink the length of a lease. ''If you have a 10-year lease, it will mean putting twice as much debt on the balance sheet as a five-year lease, so some companies may want to go short term,'' said Dale F. Schlather, an executive vice president for the commercial real estate company Cushman &amp;Wakefield and chairman of the New York chapter for the industry group CoreNet Global.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Further complicating matters is the accounting for lease renewals. Many companies sign leases with renewal terms, like a 10-year lease with an option to renew for another five years. Under the new rules, if it is likely that the company will execute the renewal option, they must account for the lease as if it were actually 15 years. Because this will mean adding more debt to the balance sheets, renewal options could become less popular.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, some industries, including most retailers, sign leases with so-called contingent rents, which are based on a percentage of sales. Under the new standard, companies with these agreements will have to estimate their sales numbers over the entire term of the lease to book it on their balance sheet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Retailers are going nuts right now,'' said Brant Bryan, a managing principal at Cresa Partners, a real estate advisory firm. ''They have the daunting task of having to estimate their sales way into the future, and to make it worse, they will have to reassess these estimates over and over at every reporting period.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Landlords will also see new accounting treatments. Mr. Golden of the standards board said that as the new rules were written now, landlords would record as a liability the obligation to provide space and record as an asset the rents they received. And while landlords currently book all of their revenue as rental income, under the new standard the rents will be recorded partly as interest income and partly as a reduction in the obligation to provide space.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it isn't all bad news. Under the new standards, companies that lease space are considered to be buying the right to use that space for a certain amount of time. So, not unlike a home buyer who begins with a large mortgage but then reduces it as the principal is paid down, companies will record their rent as a major liability at the start, but will eventually reduce this debt over the term of the lease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While many companies say they support recording their leases on their balance sheets in the interest of transparency, what is controversial is how to enact this change. Having to estimate the likelihood of a renewal option or future sales, for example, ''requires forecasting what you are going to pay rather than the legal obligation of what you will have to pay,'' said John Hepp, a partner at the advisory firm Grant Thornton. ''Accounting is supposed to be pragmatic, but now we are being asked to think more like economists. That is a whole different ballgame.''</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Mortgage Delays Blamed For Decline in Home Sales</span>
</div><div class="author">By CHRISTINE HAUSER </div><div>628 words</div><div>23 June 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales of existing homes fell in May, hurt by delays in mortgage applications and uncertainty over a federal flood insurance program, the National Association of Realtors said on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were 5.66 million sales of existing homes last month, down from a revised 5.79 million in April, the association said. While the seasonally adjusted figure for May was weaker than the 6.12 million analysts had expected, it represented a 19 percent increase from the same month last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The association's chief economist, Lawrence Yun, said the year-over-year increase was driven by a federal tax credit that applied only to home buyers who close before the end of June, making it unlikely that the performance would be sustained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are witnessing the ongoing effects of the home buyer tax credit, which we will also see in June real estate closings,'' Mr. Yun said. ''However, approximately 180,000 home buyers who signed a contract in good faith to receive the tax credit may not be able to finalize by the end of June due to delays in the mortgage process, particularly for short sales.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congress left for recess at the end of March without renewing the flood insurance program, so it was suspended from March 28 until President Obama in April signed legislation that provided a temporary extension until May 31. While technically buyers could still get a mortgage as long as they had proof that they had applied for flood insurance, some reported that in practice this was not easy or even possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Yun said uncertainty over the program apparently had some impact on May sales. More than 35 percent of homes in Louisiana and Florida were required by lenders to have flood insurance, the highest proportion nationwide, according to the Realtors association's figures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the association was also monitoring the potential impact of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill on home sales in those two states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of the credit expiration, significant weakness in the housing market is to be expected over the next several months, said Dan Greenhaus, the chief economic strategist for Miller Tabak &amp;Company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home sales ultimately affect the overall picture for consumer spending, driving things like remodeling and durable goods sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''While housing is not the giant part of the economy some imply that it is, we continue to believe that housing remains a crucially important part of the economy from a sentiment standpoint,'' Mr. Greenhaus said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added: ''As housing weakens, will consumers continually feel exuberant about their respective financial situations? We think not.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stuart Hoffman, a senior economist at PNC, said it was ''a little disappointing that sales didn't rise in May'' from April. But he noted that home prices were 2.7 percent higher than a year ago, ''so that does show there is definitely some stability in home prices.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 2.2 percent month-over-month decline in the pace of home sales was concentrated in the Northeast. The Realtors association also said inventories shrank to 3.89 million, a supply that is good for just over eight months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Single-family home sales declined 1.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.98 million in May compared with 5.06 million in April. Sales of condominiums and co-ops fell to 680,000 in May, compared with 730,000 in April, the association said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The national median existing home price for all housing types was $179,600 in May.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For 25 years, the Rev. Floyd H. Flake's Greater Allen African Methodist Episcopal Cathedral of New York successfully ran a 300-unit apartment complex for the elderly in southeastern Queens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two eight-story buildings, built and subsidized with public money, were well maintained by one of the church's charities. There was also a city-financed van service, a meals program for seniors and a women's shelter, all on the site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, about four years ago, the church sold the project for $14 million to a for-profit partnership. Tenants received a notice in the mail, and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg hailed the transaction as contributing to his efforts to preserve and build housing for moderate- and low-income residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the announcements did not reveal the identity of the new controlling owners: Mr. Flake, the Rev. Edwin C. Reed, who was then the church's former chief financial officer, and two real estate developers, Peter G. Florey and Leonard T. D'Amico.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After taking ownership, Mr. Flake, one of the city's most politically influential pastors, and his partners decided how to split a $1.1 million fee for overseeing renovation work at the project. They also decide alone how much to pay themselves for their services from the $4.3 million in cash after expenses that the city expects the property to produce through 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sale shows how lucrative financial deals involving public money and well-connected insiders can be arranged without competitive bidding and with little public attention. Mr. Flake, a former United States representative, has remained a political force in New York as the church has expanded under his leadership to some 20,000 parishioners and an annual budget, including subsidiaries, of $34 million, according to its Internet site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His endorsements, never assured based on political party, are valued for his perceived influence over his parishioners and in the wider African-American community, and he has backed Mr. Bloomberg in his last two campaigns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sale received all the required legal approvals. But irregularities in the application appear to have gone unaddressed during a short, expedited review.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Close-Knit Parties</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">William Josephson, who headed the attorney general's charity bureau from 1999 through 2004, said the sale sounded like the sort that should have received a heightened level of scrutiny because Mr. Flake and Mr. Reed had roles as both sellers and buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Clearly, it's not an arms-length transaction,'' Mr. Josephson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sale was approved in late 2006 by the office of the state attorney general, which was then led by Eliot Spitzer, who had just been elected governor. The lawyer who filed the papers with Mr. Spitzer's office was at the time also serving as a consultant to Mr. Spitzer's campaign and the treasurer of the campaign of Mr. Spitzer's running mate, David A. Paterson, the current governor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The final approval came from a court in Queens. Five hours after it was filed, the nearly 600-page petition was signed by both a judge and, serving an administrative role, the clerk of the court, Gloria D'Amico, the mother of Mr. D'Amico, one of the partners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The purchase required no cash investment from the partnership, and it was not open to bidding from others. The deal, which included plans for the renovations, was financed with $21.3 million in loans and cash from government programs intended to pay for the rehabilitation of apartment buildings for low-income elderly people. It is unclear how much of that work was ever accomplished.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Flake's finances became a matter of public curiosity this year when he emerged as a minor partner in a bid to operate a casino at Aqueduct Racetrack in Queens. Mr. Flake, with a stake of less than 1 percent, said he was motivated by the real estate development potential, but he withdrew just as all investors were required to disclose their financial holdings. The bids were later thrown out amid allegations of political favoritism, and the bidding process is now the subject of a state investigation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Through his office, Mr. Flake refused repeated requests from The New York Times to talk about the sale of the senior housing project and his role as a beneficiary. His office referred questions to Mr. Florey, with whom Mr. Flake had worked on many other of the church's real estate projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Florey, who would respond only to questions submitted in writing, said the rehabilitation work had been a success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In short, we feel that by making these upgrades we have made a great community even better,'' Mr. Florey said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Flake took over leadership of the church, then a parish of about 1,400, in 1976. He had been serving as dean of the chapel at Boston University and has said that he saw the post at what was then called Allen A.M.E. Church as an opportunity to test his ideas about churches performing community development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Allen A.M.E. Senior Citizens Housing Complex was his first major real estate undertaking. In 1978, the city sold nearly two acres on Linden Boulevard to one of the church's nonprofit affiliates, the Allen A.M.E. Housing Development Fund Corporation, for $150,000. The federal Department of Housing and Urban Development provided a $10.7 million mortgage, and the complex opened in 1981.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Flake's influence grew. He was elected the area's United States representative in 1986. Less than four years later, prosecutors charged Mr. Flake and his wife and co-pastor, Elaine McCollins Flake, with tax evasion and embezzlement. A judge threw out much of the government's case, and prosecutors dropped the remaining charges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Flake went on to thrive both on Capitol Hill and from the pulpit. Then, in 1997, just as construction of a new $23 million cathedral was being finished, he abruptly resigned from the House of Representatives, citing a desire to focus on the church.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has only grown as an engine of economic development in Queens, having overseen the church's development of a strip mall, a private school and other residential and commercial real estate projects. The support of the city -- through property tax breaks, zoning changes and low-cost properties for redevelopment -- has been central to that growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the church's reach grew, so did the wealth of Mr. Flake and his wife. After years of living in a church-owned house near the cathedral, in 2001 they bought a 7,200-square-foot house in Old Westbury, N.Y. Church affiliates have paid the couple nearly $1 million in annual salary in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All the while, the senior citizen apartment complex remained a central legacy of Mr. Flake's career.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By mid-2006, Mr. Flake had begun the process of shifting the senior center to private, for-profit ownership.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal was made possible by a change in federal law in 2000 that made it attractive for senior apartment complexes built under a federal housing program to refinance their old HUD loans. The goal was to supply an infusion of money so that the aging buildings could be renovated and remain affordable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new law allowed for-profit businesses to be involved in owning the projects for the first time, and it fit well with one of Mr. Bloomberg's most ambitious social initiatives: to build or preserve 165,000 units of affordable housing. In late 2004 the city's Housing Development Corporation began encouraging eligible senior complexes to refinance their old federal loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deals are described as refinancings. But in order to take advantage of certain tax credits, they typically involve a ''sale'' of the property, often one that exists only on paper. The properties are not listed for sale on the open market and rarely change hands.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For most charities seeking to refinance, HUD requires that the charity that built the project, or another charity with experience running similar projects, remain in control by being the only member in a general partnership. But the Allen A.M.E. loan was issued during a five-year window in which the federal housing agency had no jurisdiction over how the partnership was made up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They could sell it to you and your uncle, because they don't need HUD's permission or approval,'' said Scott E. Fireison, a lawyer who specializes in such deals from the Washington office of Pepper Hamilton, a national law firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Flake and his partners structured the deal so that they control 99.99 percent of the general partnership through two for-profit limited liability companies. The remainder is held by a nonprofit entity, headed by Mr. Florey and Mr. D'Amico, necessary to receive a property tax break from the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The structure allows the four partners to decide what fees to pay themselves, according to several experts who reviewed the structure of the partnership at the request of The New York Times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The partnership is obligated to pay the $14 million new mortgage for the housing complex. But subsidized rents and strong demand for the apartments all but guarantee a positive cash flow. After paying expenses, including property taxes and the extra costs of the larger mortgage, the property's annual net cash flow should climb steadily to more than $500,000 by 2017, according to an analysis by the city's Housing Development Corporation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time of the deal, apartments in the project rented for an average of $962 a month, with the federal Section 8 subsidy program covering about 70 percent of the total.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The partnership is not required to publicly disclose its finances. Mr. Florey declined to address what fees the partners have paid themselves or whether any agreement precludes Mr. Flake from paying himself fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Approval Processes</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The review of the sale fell to the state attorney general's office and the State Supreme Court in Queens, as required by state law when a charity sells ''substantially all'' of its assets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The review is supposed to evaluate whether the sale price is fair and to ensure that the board of the charity selling the property has approved the sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the petition filed with the court shows that the charity's board approved the sale at $17 million, not the actual sale price of $14 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the list of the five board members who approved the deal includes two church leaders who were not listed as board members in tax returns before or after the sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joan E. Flowers, a Queens lawyer, filed the petition with the attorney general's office on Nov. 9, 2006, two days after the election that elevated Mr. Spitzer and Mr. Paterson to governor and lieutenant governor. Ms. Flowers was at the time a consultant to Mr. Spitzer's campaign and the treasurer for Mr. Paterson's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The attorney general's office approved the sale on Dec. 11, 2006. A spokesman for the current attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo, said the office's records show that the petition received no special treatment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two days later, Ms. Flowers filed the petition with the State Supreme Court in Queens. In a handwritten note, she requested an emergency decision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The court obliged. Augustus C. Agate, the judge who signed the order five hours after the petition was filed, said through a spokesman that he conducted a ''perfunctory'' review of the first six pages of the filing, a level of scrutiny he believed was normal for the court's emergency section. ''The attorney general's stamp is on there,'' said the spokesman, David Bookstaver. ''As long as the papers are in order, they get signed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added that the judge had been unaware that the court clerk's son was one of the partners.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The clerk, Ms. D'Amico, did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Planned Renovations</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, it is hard to tell to what extent the very things the transaction was meant to achieve -- millions of dollars in renovations -- have actually been done. Even before the change in ownership the complex had been ''well maintained'' with ''relatively new'' thermopane windows and a six-year-old roof, noted Kathleen M. Carroll, the Queens-based appraiser hired by Mr. Flake's partners, in her 2006 report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, the plan called for $4.4 million to be spent on construction. That money was to come from the $7.3 million in proceeds from the sale of low-income housing tax credits, an indirect federal subsidy, that the project was awarded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Florey and Mr. D'Amico's company, D&amp;F Construction Group, served as the contractor for the improvements. Mr. Florey said the work included the installation of 240 security cameras, new kitchens and work on the roof, the boiler and the plumbing and electrical systems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Age and functional obsolescence of the buildings' components were the primary impetus for the upgrades,'' Mr. Florey said in a written answer to a question submitted to him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tenants at the complex said they recalled their units getting new toilets and kitchen cabinets. But unlike in similar deals financed by the city's Housing Development Corporation, Mr. Florey did not seek any construction permits, which city regulations require for everything except minor alterations and ordinary repairs. A spokeswoman said no city agency was responsible for verifying construction expenditures on the refinanced projects.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the recession, people simply looked for a house to buy. Later they got squeamish just thinking about buying. Now they are on a quest for perfection at the perfect price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Exacting buyers are upending the battered real estate market, agents and other experts say, leading to last-minute demands for multiple concessions, bruised feelings on all sides and many more collapsed deals than usual.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is a reversal of roles from the boom, when competing buyers were sometimes reduced to writing heartfelt letters saying how much they loved the house and how they promised to eternally worship the memory of the previous owners. These days, it is the buyers who are coldly seeking the absolute best deal while the sellers are left in emotional turmoil.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We see buyers who must have learned their moves from the World Wrestling Federation,'' said Glenn Kelman, chief executive of the online broker Redfin. ''They think the final smack-down occurs at the inspection, where the seller will be reluctant to refuse any demand because the alternative is putting the house back on the market as damaged goods.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Everyone expected the housing market to suffer at least a temporary hangover after the government's $8,000 tax credit expired, but not necessarily this much. Preliminary data from around the country indicates that the housing market began swooning last month immediately after the credit was no longer available. In some places, sales dropped more than 20 percent from May 2009, when the worst of the financial crisis had subsided.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders have been affected too. Construction of new homes in May dropped 17.2 percent from April, the Commerce Department said Wednesday, significantly lower than forecast. Permits for future construction dropped 10 percent, suggesting a cruel summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the lowest home mortgage rates in decades are not doing much to invite deals. The Mortgage Bankers Association said Wednesday that applications for loans to buy houses were down by a third compared with last year. Applications are back to the level of the mid-1990s, when the country's housing market was smaller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Against such a backdrop of misery, buyers are empowered -- and are taking full advantage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Porter Simons, a Seattle software engineer, thought he had a couple willing to pay $340,000 for his house. But they asked for $24,000 worth of work, most of which involved waterproofing the basement. ''It was totally irrational,'' said Mr. Simons. ''My basement has never flooded. I live on a hill.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He made a counteroffer to their offer, and the buyers walked. The house is now under contract to a new set of buyers, who got a cut in price and $2,500 in electrical work thrown in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers, of course, say they are merely being smart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chris Dunn, an economic consultant in Chicago, saw a house he liked last month for $539,000. He offered $500,000, but then his inspector told him that he would eventually have to replace the windows. The sellers were persuaded to kick in $10,000 more to pay for the work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We didn't feel we were being that aggressive,'' said Mr. Dunn. ''We had the position, 'If the seller is willing to come down enough, we will buy this home.' If they weren't willing, we would have just moved on. In this market, you have a lot of options.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some cases, agents say, sellers literally cannot afford to make concessions. Another $10,000 will push them underwater, which means they will have to arrange the sale through the bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People cashed in on their houses to get money to go on vacation, for a new roof, to send the kids to college,'' said Roberta Baldwin, an agent in Montclair, N.J. ''They thought it was always going to be worth more.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even when a sale can be worked out, it is not uncommon for everyone to walk away feeling more aggrieved than celebratory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Buyers feel they're not appreciated for simply making an offer,'' Ms. Baldwin said. ''And sellers feel humiliated and even angry. They expected to do better.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Information about scuttled deals tends to be anecdotal, but Mike Lyon of Lyon Real Estate in Sacramento estimates that 15 to 17 percent of sales in his area are falling apart at the last minute as sellers prove unable or unwilling to give buyers what they want. In a normal market, he said, the figure is about 5 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is the fallout from all the foreclosures: Buyers think that anyone who is selling must be desperate,'' said Mr. Lyon, who employs about a thousand agents. ''They walk in with the bravado of, 'The world's coming to an end, and I want a perfect place.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax credit, for all its flaws, may have helped avert financial Armageddon, but the final effect is still being tallied. In Indianapolis, the number of contracts signed in May was down 32 percent compared with May 2009. They dropped nearly 25 percent in Minneapolis/St. Paul, 20 percent in Seattle, 10 percent in Sacramento and 42 percent in Hartford. (A few areas, including Miami, showed improvements instead of declines.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pending contracts, if they are not canceled at the last minute, become official in six to eight weeks. Many deals done in April, when the credit was in effect, are still being completed and will be counted in May or June sales reports. So the severity and extent of the current slump will not become clear until fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The optimists, and real estate remains full of them, say the trough is temporary. The stimulus might have stolen sales from May but by July, they argue, people will need to buy again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, the Mortgage Bankers Association's purchase application index ticked up slightly this week after five weeks of decline, although the association declined to say the index had bottomed out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John P. Johnson of Des Moines will continue to hope, as he has for more than two years now, for a market that is healthy enough to supply him with a buyer. His house, built in 1981, is too recent to be charming and too old to be new.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When we upgraded the kitchen, we put in Corian countertops, which were fashionable at the time, but now they all want granite,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He had one offer in the fall, which fell apart when the buyer made too many demands (a shaved sales price plus paying the closing costs and all their other fees). Despite another price cut to $204,000, only one couple showed up at the last open house. His agent tells him the market is dead. The number of contracts signed in Des Moines in May was down 47 percent from last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Keeping this house ready to sell is a full-time job,'' said Mr. Johnson. ''I never thought I'd be spending my retirement doing this.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON (AP) -- Home construction plunged in May to its lowest level since December, as builders scaled back after a federal tax credit to lure buyers expired.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While housing faltered, manufacturing continued to show signs of recovery. The Federal Reserve said that industrial production rose 1.2 percent in May. Factories -- the single biggest contributor to industrial activity -- increased production by a 0.9 percent, the third consecutive monthly increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gains were broad-based, though mining output edged down by 0.2 percent. Production at utilities increased by 4.8 percent as warm weather created more demand for electricity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a third economic snapshot released Wednesday, the Labor Department said that declines in the cost of food and energy helped to drive down wholesale prices in May for a second consecutive month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing report showed that building permits declined in May, a sign that the construction industry would not fuel the economic recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said that construction of new homes and apartments fell 10 percent in May from April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 593,000. April's figure was revised downward to 659,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results were driven by a 17 percent decline in the single-family market, which had benefited earlier in the year from federal tax credits of up to $8,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Applications for new building permits, a sign of future activity, also fell. They sank 5.9 percent to an annual rate of 574,000, the lowest level in a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing report missed Wall Street expectations by a wide margin. Economists surveyed by Thomson Reuters had predicted that housing construction would fall to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 650,000 and had forecast that building permit applications would increase to an annual rate of 630,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a typical recovery, the construction sector provides much of the fuel. But that has not happened this time. Developers are trying to sell a glut of homes built during the boom years. And they must compete against foreclosed homes selling at deep discounts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home builders are feeling less confident in the recovery since government incentives for buyers expired at the end of April (buyers with signed contracts have until June 30 to complete their purchases).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Home Builders said Tuesday that its housing market index fell in June after two months of increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts expect home sales to slow in the second half of this year. In addition, high unemployment and tight mortgage lending standards have kept buyers away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its report, the Labor Department said wholesale prices dropped 0.3 percent in May after a 0.1 percent decline in April. Core inflation, which excludes energy and food, posted a 0.2 percent increase. Core prices are up just 1.3 percent over the last 12 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The continued absence of inflationary pressures means that the Federal Reserve, which meets next week, can keep interest rates low to provide support for a recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John J. Canally, an economist for the LPL Financial, said that the producer prices figures implied a greater potential for deflation than point to any ''big spike'' in inflation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The good news is that you got an increase in the core P.P.I.,'' Mr. Canally said. ''Even though it is above expectations, it is sort of comforting. It tells you there is enough demand to push up prices.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The statistics suggested that there was still robust capital spending in the economy. ''You are just not seeing any pass-through at all of higher raw materials prices to the finished prices,'' he said. ''That reflects a lot of slack in the economy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The producer prices figures, and those for consumer prices on Thursday, are being released just ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee's two-day meeting next week, a period during which market speculation is heightened about whether there will be a change in interest rate policy or the language pertaining to it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Canally said the Federal Reserve would ''take comfort from the fact there is not any pass-through'' to consumers, and that it now had ''extra wiggle room'' if needed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May, energy prices fell 1.5 percent, the biggest drop since a 2.2 percent decline in February. Gasoline prices were down 7 percent while home heating oil fell 7.4 percent and residential natural gas was down 1.1 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lower prices reflect a continued decline in oil prices which have been falling because of concerns that the European debt crisis will dampen growth prospects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists expect energy costs will keep inflation low in June as well, given that gasoline costs are down significantly from a month ago. The nationwide average for regular gasoline is $2.70 currently, down from $2.87 a month ago, according to AAA's Daily Fuel Gauge Report.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Food costs dropped 0.6 percent, the biggest decline since a 1.3 percent fall in July 2009. The decreases were led by an 18 percent drop in the cost of fresh vegetables, a category where prices had been driven higher because of damaging freezes earlier in the year in Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 0.3 percent drop in the overall inflation rate for price index was slightly less than the 0.5 percent decline economists had expected while the 0.2 percent rise in core inflation compared to a forecast 0.1 percent increase.</p>

</div><div class="author">By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS </div><div>867 words</div><div>17 June 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An agreement by the oil giant BP to put $20 billion into a fund for victims of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill lifted the stock market off its lows and sent the major indexes to a narrowly mixed finish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BP also canceled a dividend payment totaling about $2.6 billion that was scheduled for Monday and it said it would not declare a dividend for the second and third quarters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors viewed the news as an end to the uncertainty about BP's stability, and that helped steady the overall market. The Dow Jones industrial average rose about 4 points, while the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span> 500-stock index fell less than a point and the Nasdaq composite index was virtually unchanged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BP's plans to place $20 billion in a fund to compensate victims were announced after a meeting between BP executives and President Obama. Traders had been questioning how BP would handle the mounting costs of the spill, which began April 20 when a rig owned by BP exploded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One source of uncertainty has been at least partially resolved,'' said Brian Gendreau, a market strategist with Financial Network Investment Corporation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market began the day by falling on news that home construction and applications for building permits slumped in May after a home buyer tax credit ended. Meanwhile, <span class="companylink">FedEx Corporation</span> released a disappointing profit forecast for the fiscal year that began June 1, and that raised more questions about a recovery. <span class="companylink">FedEx</span> is often considered a barometer of the economy because shipping demand tends to increase as business conditions improve. The stock fell almost 6 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department's report on housing raised concerns that weaker demand for homes would hurt an economic rebound. Construction of homes and apartments fell 10 percent from a month earlier to an annual rate of 593,000, well below the 650,000 economists had forecast. A 17 percent drop in construction of single-family homes was the largest since January 1991.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Applications for building permits fell 5.9 percent to the lowest level in a year. Analysts had forecast an increase. Demand for permits is an indicator of home-building activity. The weaker-than-expected numbers followed the expiration in April of a tax credit for home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kevin L. Smith, a housing market analyst at Chapdelaine Credit Partners in New York, said the drop in the home construction and permit numbers extended a string of choppy readings since October, and that it was too soon to tell how housing would hold up. He noted that the previous month had been the best in more than two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's going to be a bumpy ride,'' Mr. Smith said. He said housing would not make a strong recovery until unemployment fell and overall confidence grew.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The home buyer's credit was part of the government package of stimulus measures intended to help the economy recover from the mortgage and financial crises of 2008. Investors have been uneasy about what would happen when the government started to pull back on those measures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow rose 4.69 points, or 0.05 percent, to 10,409.46, its fourth advance in five days. During morning trading, the Dow was down as much as 72 points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span> 500-stock index fell 0.62, or 0.06 percent, to 1,114.61, and the Nasdaq crept up 0.05 to 2,305.93.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wednesday's trading reflected the juggling act by investors for months. While many of the economic signs continue to show the recovery is proceeding, news like the home construction figures and the <span class="companylink">FedEx</span> forecast have created doubt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the still unresolved economic problems in several European countries remain a threat to the market's own recovery from its sharp losses of the last six weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Dow is still down more than 7 percent from the 2010 high of 11,205.03, reached April 26.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bond prices edged higher, pushing down interest rates. The price on the 10-year Treasury bond rose 12/32 to 102. The yield slipped to 3.26 percent from 3.30 percent late Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">FedEx</span> fell $4.94, or 6 percent, to $78.07. The company said its fiscal 2011 outlook was based on the assumption of a continued ''moderate recovery'' in the global economy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Shares of the cellphone maker <span class="companylink">Nokia</span> fell 10.7 percent on Wednesday to $8.77 after it said that its earnings this year would face tough competition from rivals.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Commercial Firms Fight Back in a Post-Boom World</span>
</div><div class="author">By JULIE SATOW </div><div>1349 words</div><div>16 June 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After taking a battering in the severest recession in modern memory, commercial real estate brokerage firms are trying different strategies to compete in a post-boom world. Some are weighing options for infusions of capital, while others are aggressively hiring or consolidating far-flung affiliates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the biggest question marks is the future of Cushman &amp;Wakefield, the world's third-largest commercial real estate brokerage, according to National Real Estate Investor magazine. After losing $127 million in 2009, Cushman &amp;Wakefield recently installed a new chief executive, Glenn Rufrano, whose specialty is turning around troubled real estate firms. The majority stakeholder in the company, the Italian firm Exor, is considering an initial public offering, according to Mr. Rufrano.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Exor is an owner that looks longer term, but like any investor, liquidity is important to them,'' he said. To increase the chance of obtaining this liquidity, either through an I.P.O. or from private financing, Mr. Rufrano is making the firm more financially open. He has a five-year time horizon -- the term of his contract with Cushman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>, based in Chicago and ranked fourth in the world, recently posted a profit after several losing quarters and began a four-year plan in January to increase its New York-area revenue by 50 percent, in part by hiring brokers away from other companies. Colliers International, which has a global presence but is less well known in the United States, is hoping that a recent move to consolidate its many separate franchises under a single name will help it gain market share and a reputation as a major player in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Cushman, Mr. Rufrano faces an uphill battle. While the slowdown in the economy has affected brokerage firms across the board, the firm has been hit particularly hard. In 2009, for example, when Cushman posted a loss -- which it attributed partly to one-time charges like the relocation of its worldwide headquarters in New York -- <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>, the largest global brokerage firm, posted a $33 million profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One main reason for Cushman's troubles may be a lack of top-down management, those familiar with the firm said. Bruce E. Mosler, who stepped down as chief executive in January, was a powerful broker in his own right and the firm is largely organized into teams that are focused around successful deal makers. These teams may compete with one another for commissions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In comparison, firms like <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span> and Colliers International favor grouping brokers together on an ad hoc basis. While there are independent brokerage teams at <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>, employees there were compensated with salaries and bonuses instead of commissions until seven years ago, helping establish a more unified culture, the firm says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Having individual teams is constraining,'' said Mitchell E. Rudin, president and chief executive officer of the tristate region of <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>. ''Instead, we select teams for a particular assignment, mixing and matching to bring together the best resources.'' While this model serves the clients, it also cuts down on friction between brokers, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is also the issue of Cushman's ownership structure. While it is private, its majority stakeholder, Exor, the investment arm of the Italian Agnelli family, is public. Exor spent $563 million to acquire a 67.5 percent position in Cushman in December 2006, at the height of the market. It later increased its position to 72 percent, and is growing anxious to see its investment turn the corner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hiring of Mr. Rufrano in February indicates that Exor is preparing an exit strategy, some analysts said. Mr. Rufrano was most recently the chief executive of Centro Properties, one of Australia's largest real estate firms, where he was credited with shoring up the public company's abysmal balance sheet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to increasing transparency at Cushman by instituting the same financial disclosures as a public company, Mr. Rufrano is working to unify the firm's management structure. This includes de-emphasizing geographic barriers so that the leasing team in London, for example, can coordinate more closely with colleagues in South America and New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The problem with Cushman is that they are not as big as <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span> or <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> globally, but they aren't small either,'' said Brandon Dobell, a principal at the investment firm <span class="companylink">William Blair &amp;Company</span> in Chicago. An I.P.O. is the most likely possibility for the firm, said Mr. Dobell, because private financing is hard to come by and a merger is unlikely as there are few players in the market with whom it would make sense.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Cushman determines its future, <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>, which posted a profit of $200,000 in the first quarter of this year compared with a $61 million loss in the same period last year, is focused on increasing revenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When I joined seven years ago,'' said Peter G. Riguardi, president of the firm's New York operations, area revenue ''was below $20 million and it is now more than $120 million. We plan to grow this by another 50 percent over the next four years to bring it to $200 million through a combination of improving market conditions and strategic hiring.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The firm recently made a splash when it hired away some of Cushman's most prolific deal makers, including much of the capital markets group. The team of Scott Latham, Richard Baxter, Jon Caplan and Ron Cohen was behind some of the largest transactions of the boom era, including the Plaza Hotel and 666 Fifth Avenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another firm that is undergoing a major shift is Colliers International. The second-largest global brokerage firm, it is largely unknown in the United States. This is partly because of its structure as a loose network of franchises that operate largely independently. Through acquisitions and management changes, the publicly traded <span class="companylink">FirstService Corporation</span> in Toronto, which owns a number of the Colliers franchises, is consolidating these firms under the Colliers International brand. Firms that decline to join will be forced to drop the Colliers moniker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are in a position where we can't lose any more market share,'' said Mark A. Jaccom, the chief executive of Colliers for the tristate region. ''We can only gain. And we plan to take our competitors' market share out from under them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Jaccom and his team are building up a consulting group and plan to hire 25 or so additional brokers. ''We want our brokers to mine their relationships, to hold our clients' hands throughout the entire process,'' he said. ''Our business is going to be much more sophisticated, where we do an entire playbook and work on everything from workplace solutions to I.T.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far a consolidated Colliers has received mixed reviews. David Gold, a senior equity analyst at Sidoti &amp;Company, said he believed ''it will be the firm to watch over the next three years. They used the downturn wisely to grow, and I wouldn't bet against them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others dismiss the move as nothing more than a name change: ''It takes years to build a brand,'' said Mitchell S. Steir, chief executive officer of Studley, a New York-based brokerage firm that specializes in representing tenants and is a competitor. ''It can't be invented overnight by slapping a new name on a collection of different firms with different philosophies.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever the chances of success, industry insiders say it is clear that changes are afoot that could lead to power shifts in the industry. ''Times of turmoil often lead to consolidation and strategy shifts,'' Mr. Dobell said. ''It will be interesting to see how it all plays out.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WITH its sweeping entrance courtyard and graceful wrought-iron scrollwork, the apartment house at 285 Central Park West at 89th Street recalls the grandeur of turn-of-the-last-century New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seven-room co-op where the celebrated pianist and teacher Sascha Gorodnitzki lived for decades also recalls a lost New York -- or would have in its heyday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A pair of concert grands dominated the double-width living room. The place has marble fireplaces, original parquet floors (the nailheads are a dead giveaway), mahogany wainscoting, beamed 10-and-a-half-foot ceilings, a formal dining room, even a telephone closet. Bay windows offer peekaboo glimpses of Central Park.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gorodnitzki died in 1986 at age 81. After his widow, Virginia, died last August, the apartment was put on the market for $2.8 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is when the property entered the realm of the estate sale, a segment of the market often inhabited by one-of-a-kind apartments that haven't been touched in decades. These places tend not to be bargains, especially after factoring in the often necessary and sometimes costly renovation. But they attract a certain species of intrepid buyer, satisfying an appetite for an ambitious redo, architectural distinction or an aura of prestige.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Gorodnitzki apartment, which is currently in contract, embodies both the upsides and downsides of estate sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eileen Robert, the senior vice president of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span> who is handling the sale on Central Park West, pulled no punches. Her listing described the kitchen and bathrooms as a ''wreck,'' and warned potential buyers that they would have to ''start from scratch'' when bringing the premises back to life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, Ms. Robert underscored the apartment's pedigree: ''A family with special musical talent lived, loved and played a concert grand piano here for over six decades,'' her listing confided. ''This spacious home certainly has good karma.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because every estate sale is different, generalizations are risky. But based on conversations with buyers, sellers and especially brokers, here is a guide to some of the things worth knowing about this often fraught yet endlessly fascinating world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What exactly is an estate sale?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Especially outside of New York, the phrase often refers to the sale of the contents of a residence -- kind of a high-end garage sale. But in New York real estate circles, the term denotes a property that has come onto the market because the occupant has died. The classic definition evokes an elderly resident who has lived for decades in a town house or co-op apartment. When the person dies, the house or apartment is offered for sale by the estate, usually siblings or children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sounds ghoulish, no?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It depends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Certain potential buyers find it creepy to visit a residence whose occupant has recently died, occasionally on those very premises, especially if the place is already something of a mausoleum. Unopened mail may lie on a table; a desk may have sat untouched for months. Some buyers refuse to set foot in an apartment that they perceive as linked to a death. For this reason, a cardinal rule for brokers handling estate sales is: ''Don't leave the hospital bed in the living room.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other buyers find such premises endearing, a testament to a long life well lived, and are enchanted with furnishings and decor that attest to such lives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One buyer who encountered a vivid image of the previous owner at an estate sale is the fashion designer Steve Fabrikant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1992, Mr. Fabrikant bought the four-bedroom apartment in the Sovereign on Sutton Place that had been the New York home of Freddie Mercury, the lead singer of the British rock band Queen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Upon visiting the apartment, Mr. Fabrikant found a dozen of Mr. Mercury's platinum albums, along with silver metallic curtains, a '50s-era chandelier and a jet-black kitchen.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What was creepy,'' said Mr. Fabrikant, who has long since transformed the apartment, ''was not that he had died, but how he had decorated the place.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Robert of Corcoran puts it another way: ''I don't think that buyers are creeped out by death. I think they're creeped out by high prices.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What are the advantages?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A buyer can sometimes obtain a spectacular property without having to pay for someone else's costly renovation. Especially for buyers eager to put their own imprint on a space and imaginative enough to see past clutter, vintage appliances, dun-colored carpeting, dingy wallpaper and tiny rooms, estate sales can offer a temptingly blank canvas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some buyers are entranced by residences that reflect a life trapped in amber. In the words of Dexter Guerrieri, who as the president of Vandenberg, the Townhouse Experts, has seen his share of estate sales, ''People like a narrative.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They also like a motivated seller, and for various financial and legal reasons, sellers of an estate often try to dispose of a property as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are there more estate sales these days, thanks to the stronger market?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not really. As one broker put it, ''People die when they die.'' And an estate generally is not able to hold off listing an apartment in the hopes of a better market. When someone dies, a clock starts ticking. There are taxes to pay. Expenses like maintenance, utilities and insurance can add up fast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sellers don't have the luxury of waiting to see if the market heats up. Generally everyone involved has an incentive to get the estate settled as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So if time is of the essence, do estate sales equal bargains?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Absolutely not, insist many brokers who specialize in this market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The sellers may be motivated, but they're not desperate,'' said Jean DeNave Segal, a Corcoran vice president who has handled more than two dozen estate sales. ''A fire sale it's not.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while the seller may want to dispose of the property quickly, some of these residences haven't been renovated in decades. Even if the sale price seems reasonable, brokers caution buyers against underestimating the cost of major improvements like new wiring (to plug in all those computers) and upgraded plumbing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The asking price may seem low, compared to comparable units in the same building,'' Ms. Robert said. ''But pricing is commensurate with the amount of work needed. When you factor in, for example, $300 per square foot of renovation costs, you're not likely to be getting a great deal.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There can also be psychic costs. As one broker explained, ''They're not for people who want to just walk in with their toothbrush.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When looking through listings, how do you recognize an estate sale?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It can be tricky.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some brokers, like Ms. Robert, identify estate sales clearly. ''Buyers will find out soon enough anyway,'' she pointed out, explaining that the nature of the sale will be evident on the paperwork. ''And if they're not interested in this sort of thing, why waste their time? And mine?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others brokers, like Burt Savitsky and Elayne Roskin, both senior vice presidents of Brown Harris Stevens who often handle estate sales as a team, take a different approach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We don't flag them as such,'' Ms. Roskin said. ''This is partly so people don't expect unrealistic bargains, but also so they're not wrongly put off.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She cited a listing for a prewar duplex on the East River that mentioned amenities like wood-burning fireplaces and a butler's pantry, but not why the property was on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The estate definitely needed updating,'' Ms. Roskin said. ''But the photos showed the property in a good light. And as you can see, there was no mention of the word 'estate.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, potential buyers learn to read between the lines, to recognize tip-off phrases like ''rarely available,'' or photos heavy on flowered rugs and fussy, old-fashioned furnishings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes there are other clues. As Ms. Roskin and Mr. Savitsky wrote in a listing for a 13-room co-op on Park Avenue, ''This lovely residence awaits a creative touch to restore it to its original grandeur.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There were lovely pictures,'' Ms. Roskin said. ''But the place needed a total redo.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Should you take an architect or contractor when you visit?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Not on the first visit,'' Ms. Roskin of Brown Harris Stevens said. ''The first time, go alone or with your spouse. Look at the layout, the space, the views, the light. Then, if you like these things, come back with your architect and your contractor. Otherwise, you're not making the best use of their time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Are estate sales more complicated than other real estate transactions?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes, which is why brokers like Mr. Savitsky and Ms. Roskin specialize in such sales. Brokers handling estate sales have to be knowledgeable about the intricacies of probate. They also have to be able to deal tactfully with still-grieving relatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such transactions often involve multiple executors, who may not be in the same state or, more important, on the same page when it comes to issues like pricing and how to dispose of the contents of a house or an apartment. (That's a polite way of saying they may fight like cats and dogs over what to do with Grandma's Duncan Phyfe sofa.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clearing out room after room filled with decades' worth of accumulated stuff, ranging from the priceless to the trash-worthy, adds yet another layer of complexity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you're the seller, how should you handle the staging issue?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With an estate sale, staging can range from a complete renovation to tossing a shawl over a disreputable sofa, along with everything in between.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Linda Stillwell, a senior vice president of Corcoran, handled an estate sale for a town house in the East 60s that had been in the same family for half a century, she spent $50,000 on painting and major cleaning, among other items. The property sold for $6.5 million, approximately $1 million above the estate's appraisal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If it hadn't been for the staging,'' Ms. Stillwell said, ''it would have been a very different conversation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet for sellers, staging can be a traumatic experience, and getting rid of the final traces of a beloved relative deeply painful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You try to honor the person whose apartment it was, but that can be complicated,'' said Ms. Segal of Corcoran. ''I remember a seller who didn't have the heart to get rid of a plastic glove box that was attached to a wall. He said to me, 'That's where my mom used to keep my gloves.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the Gorodnitzki apartment, a happy ending seems just around the corner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Admittedly, when it came on the market March 1, the place hardly looked its best. Although decades' worth of accumulation had been carted away, the green and white flowered curtains were in tatters; strips of brittle wallpaper curled down from the ceiling; and garish turquoise paint hid the beautiful French doors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the estate-sale contingent turned out, and Ms. Robert was thrilled by the response.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In 17 years in this business,'' she said, ''I never had so much traffic as on that first day, even though the place hadn't been touched in 60 years. I had 18 sets of people. And by the end of the first day, I had an offer.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here's the full text of George Soros speech on Thursday at the Institute of International Finance in Vienna, which DealBook described earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the week following the bankruptcy of <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> on Sept. 15, 2008 -- global financial markets actually broke down, and by the end of the week, they had to be put on artificial life support. The life support consisted of substituting sovereign credit for the credit of financial institutions, which ceased to be acceptable to counterparties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Mervyn King of the Bank of England brilliantly explained, the authorities had to do in the short term the exact opposite of what was needed in the long term: they had to pump in a lot of credit to make up for the credit that disappeared, and thereby reinforce the excess credit and leverage that had caused the crisis in the first place. Only in the longer term, when the crisis had subsided, could they drain the credit and re-establish macroeconomic balance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This required a delicate two-phase maneuver just as when a car is skidding. First you have to turn the car into the direction of the skid and only when you have regained control can you correct course.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first phase of the maneuver has been successfully accomplished -- a collapse has been averted. In retrospect, the temporary breakdown of the financial system seems like a bad dream. There are people in the financial institutions that survived who would like nothing better than to forget it and carry on with business as usual. This was evident in their massive lobbying effort to protect their interests in the Financial Reform Act that just came out of Congress. But the collapse of the financial system as we know it is real, and the crisis is far from over.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, we have just entered Act II of the drama, when financial markets started losing confidence in the credibility of sovereign debt. Greece and the euro have taken center stage, but the effects are liable to be felt worldwide. Doubts about sovereign credit are forcing reductions in budget deficits at a time when the banks and the economy may not be strong enough to permit the pursuit of fiscal rectitude. We find ourselves in a situation eerily reminiscent of the 1930s. Keynes has taught us that budget deficits are essential for counter cyclical policies, yet many governments have to reduce them under pressure from financial markets. This is liable to push the global economy into a double dip.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is important to realize that the crisis in which we find ourselves is not just a market failure but also a regulatory failure, and even more importantly, a failure of the prevailing dogma about financial markets. I have in mind the Efficient Market Hypothesis and Rational Expectation Theory. These economic theories guided, or more exactly misguided, both the regulators and the financial engineers who designed the derivatives and other synthetic financial instruments and quantitative risk management systems which have played such an important part in the collapse. To gain a proper understanding of the current situation and how we got to where we are, we need to go back to basics and re-examine the foundation of economic theory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I have developed an alternative theory about financial markets which asserts that financial markets do not necessarily tend toward equilibrium; they can just as easily produce asset bubbles. Nor are markets capable of correcting their own excesses. Keeping asset bubbles within bounds have to be an objective of public policy. I propounded this theory in my first book, "The Alchemy of Finance," in 1987. It was generally dismissed at the time, but the current financial crisis has proven, not necessarily its validity, but certainly its superiority to the prevailing dogma.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let me briefly recapitulate my theory for those who are not familiar with it. It can be summed up in two propositions. First, financial markets, far from accurately reflecting all the available knowledge, always provide a distorted view of reality. This is the principle of fallibility. The degree of distortion may vary from time to time. Sometimes it's quite insignificant, at other times it is quite pronounced. When there is a significant divergence between market prices and the underlying reality I speak of far from equilibrium conditions. That is where we are now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second, financial markets do not play a purely passive role; they can also affect the so-called fundamentals they are supposed to reflect. These two functions that financial markets perform work in opposite directions. In the passive or cognitive function, the fundamentals are supposed to determine market prices. In the active or manipulative function market, prices find ways of influencing the fundamentals. When both functions operate at the same time, they interfere with each other. The supposedly independent variable of one function is the dependent variable of the other, so that neither function has a truly independent variable. As a result, neither market prices nor the underlying reality is fully determined. Both suffer from an element of uncertainty that cannot be quantified. I call the interaction between the two functions reflexivity. Frank Knight recognized and explicated this element of unquantifiable uncertainty in a book published in 1921, but the Efficient Market Hypothesis and Rational Expectation Theory have deliberately ignored it. That is what made them so misleading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reflexivity sets up a feedback loop between market valuations and the so-called fundamentals which are being valued. The feedback can be either positive or negative. Negative feedback brings market prices and the underlying reality closer together. In other words, negative feedback is self-correcting. It can go on forever, and if the underlying reality remains unchanged, it may eventually lead to an equilibrium in which market prices accurately reflect the fundamentals. By contrast, a positive feedback is self-reinforcing. It cannot go on forever because eventually, market prices would become so far removed from reality that market participants would have to recognize them as unrealistic. When that tipping point is reached, the process becomes self-reinforcing in the opposite direction. That is how financial markets produce boom-bust phenomena or bubbles. Bubbles are not the only manifestations of reflexivity, but they are the most spectacular.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In my interpretation equilibrium, which is the central case in economic theory, turns out to be a limiting case where negative feedback is carried to its ultimate limit. Positive feedback has been largely assumed away by the prevailing dogma, and it deserves a lot more attention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I have developed a rudimentary theory of bubbles along these lines. Every bubble has two components: an underlying trend that prevails in reality and a misconception relating to that trend. When a positive feedback develops between the trend and the misconception, a boom-bust process is set in motion. The process is liable to be tested by negative feedback along the way, and if it is strong enough to survive these tests, both the trend and the misconception will be reinforced. Eventually, market expectations become so far removed from reality that people are forced to recognize that a misconception is involved. A twilight period ensues during which doubts grow and more and more people lose faith, but the prevailing trend is sustained by inertia. As Chuck Prince, former head of <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span>, said, "As long as the music is playing, you've got to get up and dance. We are still dancing." Eventually a tipping point is reached when the trend is reversed; it then becomes self-reinforcing in the opposite direction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Typically bubbles have an asymmetric shape. The boom is long and slow to start. It accelerates gradually until it flattens out again during the twilight period. The bust is short and steep because it involves the forced liquidation of unsound positions. Disillusionment turns into panic, reaching its climax in a financial crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The simplest case of a purely financial bubble can be found in real estate. The trend that precipitates it is the availability of credit; the misconception that continues to recur in various forms is that the value of the collateral is independent of the availability of credit. As a matter of fact, the relationship is reflexive. When credit becomes cheaper activity picks up and real estate values rise. There are fewer defaults, credit performance improves, and lending standards are relaxed. So at the height of the boom, the amount of credit outstanding is at its peak and a reversal precipitates false liquidation, depressing real estate values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bubble that led to the current financial crisis is much more complicated. The collapse of the sub-prime bubble in 2007 set off a chain reaction, much as an ordinary bomb sets off a nuclear explosion. I call it a super-bubble. It has developed over a longer period of time and it is composed of a number of simpler bubbles. What makes the super-bubble so interesting is the role that the smaller bubbles have played in its development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prevailing trend in the super-bubble was the ever increasing use of credit and leverage. The prevailing misconception was the believe that financial markets are self-correcting and should be left to their own devices. President Reagan called it the "magic of the marketplace" and I call it market fundamentalism. It became the dominant creed in the 1980s. Since market fundamentalism was based on false premises its adoption led to a series of financial crises. Each time, the authorities intervened, merged away, or otherwise took care of the failing financial institutions, and applied monetary and fiscal stimuli to protect the economy. These measures reinforced the prevailing trend of ever increasing credit and leverage and as long as they worked they also reinforced the prevailing misconception that markets can be safely left to their own devices. The intervention of the authorities is generally recognized as creating amoral hazard; more accurately it served as a successful test of a false belief, thereby inflating the super-bubble even further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It should be emphasized that my theories of bubbles cannot predict whether a test will be successful or not. This holds for ordinary bubbles as well as the super-bubble. For instance I thought the emerging market crisis of 1997-1998 would constitute the tipping point for the super-bubble, but I was wrong. The authorities managed to save the system and the super-bubble continued growing. That made the bust that eventually came in 2007-2008 all the more devastating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What are the implications of my theory for the regulation of the financial system?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First and foremost, since markets are bubble-prone, the financial authorities have to accept responsibility for preventing bubbles from growing too big. Alan Greenspan and other regulators have expressly refused to accept that responsibility. If markets can't recognize bubbles, Greenspan argued, neither can regulators--and he was right. Nevertheless, the financial authorities have to accept the assignment, knowing full well that they will not be able to meet it without making mistakes. They will, however, have the benefit of receiving feedback from the markets, which will tell them whether they have done too much or too little. They can then correct their mistakes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second, in order to control asset bubbles it is not enough to control the money supply; you must also control the availability of credit. This cannot be done by using only monetary tools; you must also use credit controls. The best-known tools are margin requirements and minimum capital requirements. Currently they are fixed irrespective of the market's mood, because markets are not supposed to have moods. Yet they do, and the financial authorities need to vary margin and minimum capital requirements in order to control asset bubbles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regulators may also have to invent new tools or revive others that have fallen into disuse. For instance, in my early days in finance, many years ago, central banks used to instruct commercial banks to limit their lending to a particular sector of the economy, such as real estate or consumer loans, because they felt that the sector was overheating. Market fundamentalists consider that kind of intervention unacceptable but they are wrong. When our central banks used to do it we had no financial crises to speak of. The Chinese authorities do it today, and they have much better control over their banking system. The deposits that Chinese commercial banks have to maintain at the People's Bank of China were increased seventeen times during the boom, and when the authorities reversed course the banks obeyed them with alacrity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Third, since markets are potentially unstable, there are systemic risks in addition to the risks affecting individual market participants. Participants may ignore these systemic risks in the belief that they can always dispose of their positions, but regulators cannot ignore them because if too many participants are on the same side, positions cannot be liquidated without causing a discontinuity or a collapse. They have to monitor the positions of participants in order to detect potential imbalances. That means that the positions of all major market participants, including hedge funds and sovereign wealth funds, need to be monitored. The drafters of the Basel Accords made a mistake when they gave securities held by banks substantially lower risk ratings than regular loans: they ignored the systemic risks attached to concentrated positions in securities. This was an important factor aggravating the crisis. It has to be corrected by raising the risk ratings of securities held by banks. That will probably discourage loans, which is not such a bad thing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fourth, derivatives and synthetic financial instruments perform many useful functions but they also carry hidden dangers. For instance, the securitization of mortgages was supposed to reduce risk thru geographical diversification. In fact it introduced a new risk by separating the interest of the agents from the interest of the owners. Regulators need to fully understand how these instruments work before they allow them to be used and they ought to impose restrictions guard against those hidden dangers. For instance, agents packaging mortgages into securities ought to be obliged to retain sufficient ownership to guard against the agency problem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Credit default swaps (CDS) are particularly dangerous they allow people to buy insurance on the survival of a company or a country while handing them a license to kill. CDS ought to be available to buyers only to the extent that they have a legitimate insurable interest. Generally speaking, derivatives ought to be registered with a regulatory agency just as regular securities have to be registered with the SEC or its equivalent. Derivatives traded on exchanges would be registered as a class; those traded over-the-counter would have to be registered individually. This would provide a powerful inducement to use exchange traded derivatives whenever possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, we must recognize that financial markets evolve in a one-directional, nonreversible manner. The financial authorities, in carrying out their duty of preventing the system from collapsing, have extended an implicit guarantee to all institutions that are "too big to fail." Now they cannot credibly withdraw that guarantee. Therefore, they must impose regulations that will ensure that the guarantee will not be invoked. Too-big-to-fail banks must use less leverage and accept various restrictions on how they invest the depositors' money. Deposits should not be used to finance proprietary trading. But regulators have to go even further. They must regulate the compensation packages of proprietary traders to ensure that risks and rewards are properly aligned. This may push proprietary traders out of banks into hedge funds where they properly belong. Just as oil tankers are compartmentalized in order to keep them stable, there ought to be firewalls between different markets. It is probably impractical to separate investment banking from commercial banking as the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 did. But there have to be internal compartments keeping proprietary trading in various markets separate from each other. Some banks that have come to occupy quasi-monopolistic positions may have to be broken up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While I have a high degree of conviction on these five points, there are many questions to which my theory does not provide an unequivocal answer. For instance, is a high degree of liquidity always desirable? To what extent should securities be marked to market? Many answers that followed automatically from the Efficient Market Hypothesis need to be reexamined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is clear that the reforms currently under consideration do not fully satisfy the five points I have made but I want to emphasize that these five points apply only in the long run. As Mervyn King explained the authorities had to do in the short run the exact opposite of what was required in the long run. And as I said earlier the financial crisis is far from over. We have just ended Act Two. The euro has taken center stage and Germany has become the lead actor. The European authorities face a daunting task: they must help the countries that have fallen far behind the Maastricht criteria to regain their equilibrium while they must also correct the deficinies of the Maastricht Treaty which have allowed the imbalances to develop. The euro is in what I call a far-from-equilibrium situation. But I prefer to discuss this subject in Germany, which is the lead actor, and I plan to do so at the Humboldt University in Berlin on June 23rd. I hope you will forgive me if I avoid the subject until then.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January 2007, not long before the market for commercial buildings peaked, Scott Rechler, the scion of a Long Island real estate family, sold the Reckson Associates Realty Corporation to S. L. Green Realty, Manhattan's largest office landlord. The $4 billion deal included five Midtown office buildings, Terry Pristin reports in The New York Times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, as the Manhattan office market is showing signs of life after a long hiatus, Mr. Rechler has been one of the first to jump back in. His private company, RXR Realty, has agreed to pay $279.3 million for a 49 percent interest in 340 Madison Avenue, at 43rd Street. That price values the building at $570 million, or $687 a square foot. The transaction is expected to close on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will be one of only five transactions so far this year for office buildings of over 100,000 square feet. But an additional seven such deals are in contract, according to the research firm <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>. Only nine sales like that were completed during all of last year, compared with 101 in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the number of transactions remains small - and several are acquisitions of loans or partial interests, as in the case of 340 Madison - real estate specialists say they are encouraged by the accelerating pace and the robust prices. "We're not seeing $1,200-a-foot trades, but some buildings are trading not too far off from where prices were before the market went crazy in 2006 and 2007," said Robert M. White Jr., the president of <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When investors feel confident about future rent growth, they are willing to pay higher prices and thus accept a lower initial return. Several real estate specialists said the recent drop in capitalization rates, or first-year yield - the yardstick by which the real estate industry measures the health of a market - had been surprisingly rapid. When S. L. Green bought Reckson, the capitalization rate, or cap rate, was 3 to 4 percent, Mr. Rechler said. When investors began buying again last fall, the cap rate had climbed to 7 to 8 percent. Now, rates are generally 5 to 6 percent. The decline in cap rates means an increase in value of 35 to 50 percent, said Michael Knott, an analyst for Green Street Advisors, a research company in Newport Beach, Calif. "It has been a stunning reversal," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The prices indicate that buyers are making a bet that rents will increase and that the market will continue to recover, Mr. Knott said. "There's not a lot of margin for error," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though a lot of capital has been raised for investment in commercial real estate, few properties have been put on the market. As a result, it is difficult to be certain where values stand. "What you've seen is a scarcity premium," said Scott A. Singer, the executive vice president of the Singer &amp; Bassuk Organization, a New York company that arranges financing for transactions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Singer said the thinking among investors and lenders had altered radically. "There's been a tremendous change in the last 30 to 45 days, in terms of aggressiveness and the desire to consummate transactions," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Financing is once again available, but lenders are no longer underwriting loans based on projections of significant future rent growth or lease-up, as they did in the last cycle, and buyers must put up at least 20 percent of the equity, said Marcus Giancaterino, the global head of commercial real estate finance at <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span>. "The bottom line is that there is a functioning debt market," he said. He said the Greek debt crisis had made people more cautious, "but nobody has stopped doing business."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because public companies tend to use less leverage than many private investors, it is perhaps not surprising that they have been the most active recent buyers. Scott Latham, an executive managing director of <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>, said real estate investment trusts, or REITs, like S. L. Green, accounted for 18 percent of the commercial real estate acquisitions in 2007, but only 10 percent last year. Their buying share has increased to 26 percent this year, Mr. Latham said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent months, S. L. Green has agreed to pay $330 million, or $547 a square foot, for 125 Park Avenue, a 26-story tower between 41st and 42nd Streets; and $193 million, or $636 a square foot, for 600 Lexington Avenue, a 36-story building at 52nd Street. The company is selling minority stakes in 600 Lexington and the <span class="companylink">McGraw-Hill</span> headquarters building at 1221 Avenue of the Americas (between 48th and 49th Streets), to the <span class="companylink">Canada Pension Plan Investment Board</span>. S. L. Green stopped buying in December 2007, but the company has completed transactions worth more than $900 million in the last six months, including debt and equity acquisitions, said Marc Holliday, the chief executive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Public companies have an advantage today because private equity buyers who drove up prices in the last cycle using high leverage have been pushed aside, Mr. Holliday said. "That opened the path to public companies," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three buildings in the S. L. Green transactions last changed hands well before the commercial real estate frenzy. Many buildings that traded from the end of 2005 through 2007 have run into serious trouble because they do not generate enough cash to cover the mortgage payments and other costs. Analysts expected a flood of distress sales, but these have not materialized, even though the number of troubled properties keeps growing. <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>' list includes 49 office buildings in Manhattan, with a total value of $6.3 billion, said Ben Carlos Thypin, a senior market analyst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the most recent additions to the list is 1095 Avenue of the Americas, the newly renovated Verizon Building opposite Bryant Park at 42nd Street, which the <span class="companylink">Blackstone Group</span> acquired in February 2007 as part of its highly leveraged $39 billion purchase of <span class="companylink">Equity Office Properties</span>. But the building's loan is the largest in a pool of commercial mortgages, known as a commercial mortgage-backed security, that has been transferred to a so-called special servicer because it is on the verge of default, according to Fitch Ratings. The building is only 82.6 percent occupied, and leases for 40.4 percent of the space are set to expire by May 2012, Fitch said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Relatively few of these troubled buildings have been offered for sale because lenders have been willing to extend the loans in the hope of future rent increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if interest rates rise significantly, as many have predicted, more buildings will be under water and there is likely to be more pressure to sell, said Richard Baxter, another executive managing director of <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 340 Madison Avenue building in which RXR is acquiring a 49 percent interest has a $400 million mortgage, which must be repaid at the end of 2011. Broadway Partners, a company that once snapped up office towers in Manhattan and elsewhere at a frenetic pace, bought the 22-story building from Harry Macklowe for $550 million in November 2006, when it was more than half vacant. Broadway Partners, which has a much diminished portfolio, sank $50 million into 340 Madison and increased its occupancy to 92 percent, Mr. Rechler said. RXR plans to manage the building, where the average annual rent is around $60 a square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rechler, who planned to refinance the mortgage, said he had been looking for opportunities in Manhattan for more than a year. New development of office buildings has been limited, and companies are beginning to grow - factors that normally send Manhattan rents soaring. "We don't know if it's a year away," he said, "but some time it's likely to happen."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FRANKFURT</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IT'S a $2.6 trillion mystery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's the amount that foreign banks and other financial companies have lent to public and private institutions in Greece, Spain and Portugal, three countries so mired in economic troubles that analysts and investors assume that a significant portion of that mountain of debt may never be repaid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem is, alas, that no one -- not investors, not regulators, not even bankers themselves -- knows exactly which banks are sitting on the biggest stockpiles of rotting loans within that pile. And doubt, as it always does during economic crises, has made Europe's already vulnerable financial system occasionally appear to seize up. Early last month, in an indication of just how dangerous the situation had become, European banks -- which appear to hold more than half of that $2.6 trillion in debt -- nearly stopped lending money to one another.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, with government resources strained and confidence in European economies eroding, some analysts say the Continent's banks have to come clean with a transparent and rigorous accounting of their woes. Until then, they say, nobody will be able to wrestle effectively with Europe's mounting problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The marketplace knows very little about where the real risks are parked,'' says Nicolas Veron, an economist at Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels. ''That is exactly the problem. As long as there is no semblance of clarity, trust will not return to the banking system.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Limited disclosure and possibly spotty accounting have been long-voiced concerns of analysts who follow European banks. Though most large publicly listed banks have offered information about their exposure -- <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span> in Frankfurt says it holds 500 million euros in Greek government bonds and no Spanish or Portuguese sovereign debt -- there has been little disclosure from the hundreds of smaller mortgage lenders, state-owned banks and thrift institutions that dominate banking in countries like Germany and Spain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Depfa, a German bank that is now based in Dublin, is one of the few second-tier European banking institutions that have offered detailed disclosures about their financial wherewithal, and its stark troubles may be emblematic of those still hidden on other banks' books.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite boasting as recently as two years ago of its ''very conservative lending practices,'' Depfa, which caters primarily to governments, has flirted with disaster. It narrowly avoided collapsing in late 2008 until the German government bailed it out, and today its books are still laden with risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DEPFA and its parent, <span class="companylink">Hypo Real Estate</span> Holding, a property lender outside Munich, have 80.4 billion euros in public-sector debt from Greece, Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Italy. The amount was first disclosed in March but did not draw much attention outside Germany until last month, when investors decided to finally try to tally how much cross-border lending had gone on in Europe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before Greece's problems spilled into the open this year, investors paid little heed to how much lending European banks had done outside their own countries -- so it came as a surprise how vulnerable they were to economies as weak as those of Greece and Portugal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everybody knew there was a lot of debt out there,'' said Nick Matthews, senior European economist at <span class="companylink">Royal Bank of Scotland</span> and one of the authors of the report that tallied up Greek, Spanish and Portuguese debt. ''But I think the extent of the exposure was a lot higher than most people had originally thought.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Concern has quickly spread beyond just the sovereign bonds issued by the three countries as well as by Italy and Ireland, which are also seriously indebted. Private-sector debt in the troubled countries is also becoming an issue, because when governments pay more for financing, so do their domestic companies. Recession, along with higher interest payments, could lead to a surge in corporate defaults, the European Central Bank warned in a report on May 31.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Hypo Real Estate</span> has hundreds of millions in shaky real estate loans on its books, as well as toxic assets linked to the subprime crisis in the United States. In the first quarter, it set aside an additional 260 million euros to cover potential loan losses, bringing the total to 3.9 billion euros. But that amount is a drop in the bucket, a mere 1.6 percent of Hypo's total loan portfolio. Hypo has not yet set aside anything for money lent to governments in Greece and other troubled countries, arguing that the European Union rescue plan makes defaults unlikely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The European Central Bank estimates that the Continent's largest banks will book 123 billion euros ($150 billion) for bad loans this year, and an additional 105 billion euros next year, though the sums will be partly offset by gains in other holdings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts at the <span class="companylink">Royal Bank of Scotland</span> estimate that of the 2.2 trillion euros that European banks and other institutions outside Greece, Spain and Portugal may have lent to those countries, about 567 billion euros is government debt, about 534 billion euros are loans to nonbanking companies in the private sector, and about 1 trillion euros are loans to other banks. While the crisis originated in Greece, much more was borrowed by Spain and its private sector -- 1.5 trillion euros, compared with Greece's 338 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beyond such sweeping estimates, however, little other detailed information is publicly known about those loans, which are equivalent to 22 percent of European G.D.P. And the inscrutability of the problem, as serious as it is, is spawning spoofs, at least outside the euro zone. A pair of popular Australian comedians, John Clarke and Bryan Dawe, who have created a series of sketches about various aspects of the financial crisis, recently turned their attention to the bad-debt problem in Europe. After grilling Mr. Clarke about the debt crisis in a mock quiz show, Mr. Dawe tells Mr. Clarke that his prize is that he has lost a million dollars. ''Well done,'' says Mr. Dawe. ''That's an extraordinary performance.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On a more serious front, Timothy F. Geithner, the United States Treasury secretary, visited Europe at the end of May and called on European leaders to review their banks' portfolios, as American regulators did last year, to separate healthy banks from those that need intensive care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others say that if such reviews do not occur, the banking sector in Europe could be crippled and the broader economy -- dependent on loans for business expansions and job growth -- could stall. And if that happens, says Edward Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, the Continent's banks could find themselves sinking even further because ''European governments won't be in a position to help them again.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LENDING practices at Depfa may have seemed conservative before its 2008 meltdown, but its business model had always been based on a precarious assumption: borrowing at short-term rates to finance long-term lending, often for huge infrastructure projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From its base in Dublin, where it moved from Germany in 2002 for tax reasons, Depfa helped raise money for the Millau Viaduct, the huge bridge in France; for refinancing the <span class="companylink">Eurotunnel</span> between France and Britain; and for an expansion of the Capital Beltway in suburban Virginia. Depfa was also a big player in the United States in other ways, like lending to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in New York and to schools in Wisconsin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the current crisis, Depfa was proud of its engagement in Mediterranean Europe. In its 2007 annual report, the company boasted of helping to raise 200 million euros for Portugal's public water supplier and 100 million euros for public transit in the city of Porto. In Spain, it helped cities such as Jerez refinance their debt and helped raise money for public television stations in Valencia and Catalonia as well as raise 90 million euros for a toll road in Galicia. And in Greece, Depfa raised 265 million euros for the government-owned railway and in 2007 told shareholders of a newly won mandate: providing credit advice to the city of Athens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Depfa said it performed a rigorous analysis of the creditworthiness of its customers, including a 22-grade internal rating system in addition to outside ratings. More than a third of its buyers earned the top AAA rating, the bank said in 2008, while more than 90 percent were A or better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The public infrastructure projects in which Depfa specialized were considered low-risk, and typically generated low interest payments. Yet because long-term interest rates were typically higher than short-term rates, Depfa could collect the difference, however modest, in profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To outsiders, Depfa still looked like a growth story even after the subprime crisis began in the United States. <span class="companylink">Hypo Real Estate</span>, which focused on real estate lending, acquired Depfa in 2007. After the acquisition, Depfa kept its name and its base in Dublin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when the United States economy reached the precipice in September 2008, banks suddenly refused to make short-term loans to one another, blowing a hole in Depfa's financing and leaving it with a loss for the year of $5.5 billion and dependent on the German government for a bailout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Hypo's 2008 annual report said of Depfa: ''The business model has proved not to be robust in a crisis.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with Depfa's myriad travails, most investors weren't aware of the extent of its cross-border problems until it disclosed them this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question now hanging over Europe is how many other banks have problems similar to Depfa's, but haven't disclosed them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On May 7, the cost of insuring against credit losses on European banks reached levels higher than in the aftermath of the <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> collapse in the United States. Officials at the European Central Bank warned that risk premiums were soaring to levels that threatened their ability to carry out their fundamental role of controlling interest rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three days later, European Union governments joined with the International Monetary Fund to offer nearly $1 trillion in loan guarantees to Europe's banks. At the same time, the European Central Bank began buying government bonds for the first time ever to prevent a sell-off of Greek, Spanish and other sovereign debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The measures, widely regarded as a de facto bank rescue, restored some calm to the markets, but critics said that the aid merely bought time without reducing overall debt load. Europe's major stock indexes and the euro have continued to fall as investors remain dubious about the ability of Greece and perhaps other countries to repay their debts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, figuring out which banks may be most exposed to those countries largely remains a guessing game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regulators in each country know what assets their domestic banks hold, but have been reluctant to share that information across borders. Lucas D. Papademos, vice president of the European Central Bank, which gets an indication of banks' health based on which ones draw heavily on its emergency credit lines, said at a news conference Monday that a small number of banks were ''overreliant'' on that funding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Papademos, who retired last Tuesday at the end of his term, wouldn't be more specific. He said European banks would undertake a vigorous round of stress tests by July.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's obvious that Greek and Spanish banks hold large amounts of their own government's bonds. Spanish banks hold 120 billion euros in sovereign debt, according to the Spanish central bank. But a central bank spokesman said that those holdings were not a problem because, thanks to the European Union's rescue plan, the prices of Spanish bonds have recovered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Guessing also falls heavily on public and quasipublic institutions like the German Landesbanks, which are owned by German states sometimes in conjunction with local savings banks. Five of Germany's nine Landesbanks required federal or state government support after they loaded up on assets that later turned radioactive, ranging from subprime loans in the United States to investments in Icelandic banks that failed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the <span class="companylink">Royal Bank of Scotland</span> study, banks in France have the largest exposure to debt from Greece, Spain and Portugal, with 229 billion euros; German banks are second, with 226 billion euros. British and Dutch banks are next, at about 100 billion euros each, with American banks at 54 billion euros and Italian banks at 31 billion euros.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Banks continue to not trust each other,'' says Jorg Rocholl, a professor at the European School of Management and Technology in Berlin. ''They know other banks are sick, but they don't know which ones.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DEPFA and <span class="companylink">Hypo Real Estate</span>, meanwhile, face continued setbacks as they try to steer back to health. Hypo reported a pretax loss for the group of 324 million euros in the first quarter, down from 406 million euros a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the end of May, the German government raised its guarantees for Hypo to 103.5 billion euros from 93.4 billion. Some analysts say they think the bank may need more aid in the future.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't think it's over yet,'' says Robert Mazzuoli, an analyst at Landesbank Baden-Wurttemberg in Stuttgart.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">High-End Sales Canter; Prices Walk</span>
</div><div class="author">By ELSA BRENNER </div><div>918 words</div><div>6 June 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>10</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN Westchester, well known for its pricey homes and estates in sought-after locales like Bedford and Chappaqua, many buyers and sellers are wondering whether the high-end sector of the real estate market is rebounding -- or still mired in the downturn that took hold two years ago and has been slow to let go.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The answer is some of both, market watchers say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comparing this April with last, the New York State Association of Realtors reported a 60 percent jump in the number of single-family home sales, to 284, with 18 percent selling for $1 million or more. That is an improvement, if far under the highs reached in 2005, 2006 and 2007, when sales of a million dollars and over represented more than 30 percent of all single-family transactions, according to the group's statistics. In 2007, 418 single-family homes sold for $1 million or more. The next year that number was down to 214, and last year it fell to 154.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also in April, the median sales price of a single-family home in the county finally reversed its free fall and rose to $590,000, according to the real estate group. That compares with $532,000 in the first quarter of 2009 and $635,000 for the first quarter of 2007. The increase in the median -- the number at the middle, with half of sales higher and half lower -- is a direct reflection of more sales at the high end, the association said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One factor contributing to the uptick is a more-vigorous market for co-ops and condominiums in Manhattan, which in turn is ''stirring the luxury market here,'' said P. Gilbert Mercurio, the chief executive of the Westchester-Putnam Association of Realtors and the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service. Buyers relocating from New York City generally make up about a quarter of Westchester's sales activity, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the current market, well-heeled bargain-hunters are focusing on properties that languished last year and as a result have undergone significant price cuts, said Robert Kesten, a sales agent with Vincent &amp;Whittemore Real Estate in Bedford. At the same time, because competition among sellers is stiff and because there is an excess of inventory, even upscale houses that are new to the market are priced far lower than they would have been several years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As an example, Mr. Kesten cited a Bedford contemporary with four bedrooms and four-and-a-half baths on six acres, with a pool, a tennis court and a private lake, listed for $3.625 million. ''Two years ago,'' he said, ''that property would have been listed for $5 million, easily.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, there is a contingent of buyers, financial types among them, who are able to pay cash and thus are relatively immune to the vagaries of the market, Mr. Kesten said, adding, ''Those are the ones who can seriously close a deal.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But even with reduced prices and an infusion of new buyers, many houses remain unsold for a long time, which is why an argument can be made that the recession still has a firm grip on the market. The 6,568 units for sale at the end of the first quarter was 4 percent greater than last year at that time, and 11 percent greater than in 2008, according to the Westchester-Putnam Realtors' association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the increase in inventory is caused by homeowners who perceive conditions to be improving. Other sellers, feeling the persistent pain of a slow economy, sell because they can no longer afford to maintain an expensive property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory glut has prompted the expansion of a previously Manhattan-centric auction company called Bid on the City, which is seeking to siphon off the excess in Westchester and the Hamptons as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vlad Sapozhnikov, one of the service's founders, said that from his perspective, the housing market ''remains under massive stress.'' He describes Bid on the City as ''the new <span class="companylink">eBay</span> for real estate.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anxious owners sometimes list their house with an agency and also put it up for bid with Mr. Sapozhnikov's company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Live bidding takes place in Bid on the City's 4,000-square-foot headquarters on Fifth Avenue. Bids can also be made online with video and audio streamed in real time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Scarsdale, Ed Ferguson, a senior vice president for Westchester of Julia B. Fee <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span>, said he was skeptical of Bid on the City. ''We're watching to see if it works,'' he said, citing his concern that the bidding service could force prices to drop even further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the words of Mark J. Seiden, a broker-owner in Briarcliff Manor, a ''market valuation crush'' at the top end is compressing prices all down the line. For example, what used to be a $1.2 million house in Chappaqua can now be had for $899,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Left to the effects of supply and demand, Mr. Ferguson predicted, the market will recover, albeit ''ever so slowly.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The numbers indicate that buyer demand is improving, that the market is coming back,'' he added. ''But the recovery is still in the early stages and therefore still vulnerable.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's nice to see that everything is back to normal in Sheldon H. Solow's real estate empire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Solow, who is 81 and owns one of the most desirable office towers in Manhattan, is back in the office after a short absence. He has resumed the bitter legal battle with his erstwhile partners, the Fisher real estate family, according to court documents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Fishers say Mr. Solow owes them $111 million. The two sides had recently hammered out an agreement to settle the dispute. But ultimately Mr. Solow, a highly litigious developer with more than 200 lawsuits to his credit, refused to sign on the bottom line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, Mr. Solow's apparent refusal to approve any deals for a giant block of vacant space - 800,000 square feet - at his 50-story skyscraper at 9 West 57th Street prompted the real estate broker <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span> to quit, for the second time in seven months, according to real estate executives who spoke on the condition of anonymity rather than risk incurring Mr. Solow's legal wrath.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Solow had been a steady presence in his 45th-floor office at 9 West 57th until sometime in January, when he stopped coming in to work, according to real estate executives and former employees. Before he left, Mr. Solow, a brilliant but irascible developer, dismissed a number of key longtime executives, while others quit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His son, Stefan Solow, who has never shown any inclination to work beside his father, took charge, hiring Jay B. Fischoff to manage the holdings and trying to extinguish some of the many lawsuits his father had initiated. Although the Solow family real estate and extensive art collection are worth several billion dollars, the younger Solow seemed intent on raising cash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stefan Solow, who is 35, offered to sell an undeveloped parcel on First Avenue to the developers Leonard Litwin and Douglas Durst, although his father later scuttled that move as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The elder Solow has now returned; Mr. Fischoff has been dismissed. His son? He is back on the family wheat farm in Kansas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a brief telephone conversation, Mr. Solow said he was firmly in control of his multibillion-dollar empire of residential and commercial buildings. "I was always at the helm," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The vacant space at 9 West 57th Street certainly put a crimp in the building's cash flow. To make matters worse, Mr. Solow's long-running dispute with <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> ended in March with an $85.7 million court judgment against him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephen B. Siegel, a top broker at <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>, quit last November and subsequently filed a lien for $1.6 million in unpaid commissions. Mr. Siegel's friends say that he became frustrated with Mr. Solow's refusal to lease space for anything less than boom-time rents of $200 per square foot. Effective rents have fallen about 45 percent since the peak.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stefan Solow brought Mr. Siegel back, and Mr. Siegel once again tried to line up tenants. But when Mr. Solow returned to work last month, a deal fell through and, once again, the broker resigned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then there's that dispute with the Fishers, his former partners in a planned $4 billion commercial and residential project on nine acres along First Avenue, south of 42nd Street. The Fisher family contends in State Supreme Court that Mr. Solow still owes them about $111 million plus interest for their remaining interest in the deal. Mr. Solow countersued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month, the Fishers filed a motion demanding that Mr. Solow immediately pay them $16,625,000, their share of the proceeds from the sale of land at First Avenue and 35th Street, to the city's School Construction Authority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Solow also rejected the idea of settling his dispute with the estate of Howard P. Ronson. A justice in State Supreme Court had dismissed Mr. Solow's $115 million lawsuit against Mr. Ronson in 2005, calling the developer's conspiracy theory "absurd" and the action "completely without merit." Mr. Solow has been contesting court-imposed sanctions against both him and his lawyer, who is now in prison on an unrelated matter.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON (AP) -- A rush of home buyers trying to meet a deadline to qualify for a federal tax credit pushed the number of signed sales contracts in April to the highest level since October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtors said Wednesday that its seasonally adjusted index of sales agreements for previously occupied homes rose 6 percent in April from a month earlier to a reading of 110.9. March's reading was revised upward to 104.6.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rise was the third consecutive month of increases, all of them aided by federal tax credits of up to $8,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the tax credits expired on April 30 and many analysts expect sales to decline in the coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Clearly, the race to meet the tax credit deadline has left the home-buying pipeline rather empty, and we fear that still high unemployment, heavy indebtedness and tight credit will mean that it stays that way,'' wrote Paul Dales, United States economist with Capital Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Evidence of a slowing market was apparent Wednesday when the Mortgage Bankers Association released a weekly report on applications to buy homes. Applications fell for the fourth-straight week to the lowest level since April 1997.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors, however, seemed pleased with the April rise in pending home sales. The Dow Jones industrial average rose more than 60 points in early trading.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The association's index provides an early measurement of sales activity because there is usually a one- to two- month lag between a sales contract and a completed deal. A reading of 100 is equal to the average level of sales activity in 2001, when the index started.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congress included a temporary tax credit to increase home sales in the $787 billion stimulus package signed into law a month after President Obama took office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 2.6 million households used the credit as of late April at a cost of $18.7 billion, according to the Internal Revenue Service.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest increase in pending sales was in the Northeast, where sales rose nearly 30 percent. Sales were up 7.5 percent in the West and about 4 percent in the Midwest. They fell 0.6 percent in the South.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The W Hotel in Union Square has had an eventful six months. The 270-room hotel changed hands in December after the private equity division of <span class="companylink">Dubai World</span> defaulted on a $117 million mezzanine loan in the face of dwindling business. But the lender, LEM Mezzanine, could itself lose the hotel in coming months as a result of its filing for bankruptcy protection earlier this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mezzanine loans, which are secured by stock or other ownership stakes in a company, became a popular form of secondary financing during the real estate boom, offering high returns to investors and high interest rates for borrowers. There is an estimated $100 billion in mezzanine loans outstanding across the country, and when the economy slowed and business slumped they became a special headache for borrowers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But despite built-in risks, lenders say mezzanine loans are beginning to resurface, albeit slowly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's become something people want to do again,'' said William Shanahan, a vice chairman at <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span> who specializes in investment properties in New York. ''I think it's fair to say that right now the desire to place mezzanine debt outweighs the demand for it, but a lot of people are looking to put mezzanine loans on their properties. There are a number of players out there right now.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like the level between the first and second floors for which it is named, mezzanine loans come second in priority to the first mortgage. The loans are typically secured by stock in the company, so that if a property owner defaults, he risks not only handing over the keys to his building but also the equity tied to the asset. By comparison, when a borrower defaults on a first mortgage, only the property itself is at stake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a result, many building owners who financed property at the height of the real estate bubble, including the proprietors of the W Hotel and the Hancock Tower in Boston, were at the mercy of mezzanine lenders after the economy turned down, profits shrank and junior loans swirled into default.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March 2009, Normandy Real Estate Partners, based in New Jersey, took control of the Hancock Tower, the tallest building in New England, by quietly buying up mezzanine debt shortly after the property's owner, Broadway Partners, defaulted on loan payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as banks begin to provide more senior financing on commercial assets and investor confidence returns to the market, so too will increased demand for new mezzanine loans, lenders said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since January, an estimated $374 million in mezzanine and other secondary loans have been issued across the country, an increase from just $210 million in all of 2009, according to data provided by <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>, the Chicago-based commercial real estate services firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Typically, borrowers who are unable to secure all of their financing needs for a property acquisition with a first mortgage have few options other than a mezzanine loan, mainly because first mortgage lenders usually demand locked-in agreements barring a second mortgage with similar terms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Little by little, you're going to have more liquidity in the market, which means the volume of mezzanine lending is going to increase,'' said Bruce Batkin, the president of Terra Capital Partners, a real estate investment company based in New York. ''I think that's going to be happening in the second half of the year.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Pembrook Group, a fund management company based in Harrison, N.Y., is expected to originate as much as $100 million in mezzanine debt by the end of the year, including half a dozen pending deals in Chicago, California, Florida and Texas, said John Garth, a managing director in the New York City office of the six-year-old company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late January, the group placed a $12 million mezzanine loan at an existing office park outside Pittsburgh owned by the Keystone Property Group, which secured a $42 million mortgage from <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>, Mr. Garth said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Money has become much more available and at much more attractive rates in the last 90 days, and business is getting signed up and closed,'' said Mr. Garth, who said Pembrook originated about $250 million in mezzanine loans in 2006, at the peak of the market. ''It's literally been since the first of February that we've seen a lot of competition on high-quality deals, from Wall Street shops, banks and insurance companies.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Partners Group, a private asset manager based in Switzerland, demand for mezzanine loans has escalated significantly since January, said Eliza Bailey, a senior vice president in the company's San Francisco office. She predicted that by the end of this year the group would place upwards of $300 million in mezzanine debt, both nationally and globally.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the Partners Group's recent deals, she said, was a $10 million mezzanine loan on a portfolio of commercial buildings throughout the United States, as well as an $11.3 million loan on a collection of residential assets in Germany.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's improved dramatically in 2010 as far as the quality of the new asset deals that are in the market,'' Ms. Bailey said. ''There's more visibility to value the underlying assets, and there's a little bit more of a market acceptance of where we are in the cycle. In 2009, I don't think anybody was clear about where we were or where we were headed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dan Gorczycki, a managing director at Savills, said that until banks ramped up efforts to foreclose on defaulted loans, rather than extend them indefinitely, mezzanine lending opportunities would continue to be relatively scarce. The so-called extend-and-pretend strategy practiced by banks, he said, has prevented many commercial properties from returning to the market and, subsequently, from being refinanced with the help of mezzanine debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now that the market's recovered, some banks are getting tougher, but other banks are saying, 'Let's give these guys some more time to work things out,' '' Mr. Gorczycki said. ''It's been a combination of factors that have led these banks to do this, but it's really frustrated the mezzanine lenders who were hoping to make yield.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When nobody's forced to sell, there's nothing left to buy,'' he added. ''The real estate market goes up by just that factor alone. It's no different than the stock market.''</p>

</div><div class="author">By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS </div><div>384 words</div><div>2 June 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>9</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON (AP) -- The economic recovery gained strength on the biggest rise in construction spending in nearly a decade and the 10th consecutive month of expansion for the manufacturing sector.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Temporary government incentives drove most of the construction spending increases in April. Industry spending rose 2.7 percent with gains in all major sectors, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a separate report on Tuesday, the Institute for Supply Management, a trade group of purchasing executives, said its manufacturing index dipped slightly in May from a nearly six-year high in April. But the 59.7 reading for May was well above the 50 level that indicates expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Export orders rose last month despite the debt crisis in Europe, which threatens to spread.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The European fiscal crisis doesn't appear to have harmed the prospects of U.S. manufacturers, at least not yet,'' wrote Paul Ashworth, senior United States economist with Capital Economics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wall Street welcomed the news. Stocks erased early losses after the two reports signaled a lift in the economic recovery. The Dow Jones industrial average rose about 40 points in midday trading after sliding in early trading, though it ended the day down 112.61 points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A home buyer tax credit helped residential construction surge 4.4 percent in April. The tax credit expired at the end of April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government spending rose 2.4 percent. The increase was aided by the economic stimulus program that Congress passed in February 2009. State and local spending rose 2.3 percent, and federal spending was up 2.9 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other major sector, nonresidential construction, climbed 1.7 percent. That was the first advance in that category since March 2009. The strength in April came from gains in private sector work on communications projects and power generation facilities. Construction of office buildings and the category that includes shopping centers fell in April. Commercial building projects have suffered in the weak economy through rising loan defaults and tighter credit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the manufacturing report, the group's employment index, which measures employers' willingness to hire, rose 1.3 percentage points to 59.8. That was the highest level since May 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New orders, a gauge of future production, were unchanged at 65.7.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Paramount Bay condominium is a 47-story steel-and-glass cadaver. Conceived at the height of the real estate boom as another ultraluxury tower in a city that would soon be choking on them, it looms unfinished and unoccupied on Biscayne Bay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lobby is like a mortuary, The New York Times's Devin Leonard writes. There are no chandeliers on the three-story ceiling, no paintings on the walls. And there is nobody at the front desk to greet visitors. The only sound is the eerie gurgle of a 40-foot waterfall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of this deters Barry Sternlicht, the real estate investor who owns the building. "The bones," he says, gesturing around the room. "The bones are extraordinary!"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sternlicht plans to transform Paramount Bay into a haven for wealthy buyers who will one day want to live here. But he concedes that the building's entrance needs work. "This looks like an abandoned property," he says. "We have to make it look like it's alive."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pool area lacks something, too. "It needs a concept," he says, wrinkling his brow. He's not yet sure what that will be. But he knows this much: The bamboo trees adorning the entrance have to go. "We should put some wisteria or some vines over there," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then it's up to one of the top floors to admire the sweeping views from an empty unit. "Look at this," he says, pointing out the landmarks in the distance: South Beach, Key Biscayne and the downtown Miami skyline. "Someone is going to want to live here - someday."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps such brio is a prerequisite for an investor wading into the worst real estate wipeout in generations, Mr. Leonard writes in a lengthy profile of the real estate investor. Indeed, Mr. Sternlicht, 49, has been one of the downturn's busiest buyers. In the last year and a half, his private equity firm, Starwood Capital, has raised more than $3 billion. He has bought land in Florida and ski lodges in Colorado. He created a real estate finance company, <span class="companylink">Starwood Property Trust</span>, which he took public last August in a successful initial public offering. And on Friday he ended an aggressive but unsuccessful run at Extended Stay Hotels, which was being auctioned off in bankruptcy court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But his highest-profile deal has been the acquisition of the $4.5 billion real estate loan portfolio of Corus Bankshares, the nation's largest condominium construction lender until it failed last September because it had financed too many projects like Paramount Bay. The following month, Mr. Sternlicht and a group of investors - including TPG Capital, WLR LeFrak and Perry Capital - won the loans in an auction run by the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, paying $554 million for 40 percent of the package, valuing the debt at 60 cents on the dollar. The F.D.I.C. holds the remaining 60 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sternlicht hopes to foreclose on many of Corus's errant borrowers, restyle their buildings and sell units for a significant profit once the real estate market recovers. He says he and his investors can afford to wait until then because the F.D.I.C. has provided them with $1.4 billion in zero-coupon financing and an additional $1 billion in low-cost loans that can be used to complete unfinished projects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There's an upside for the F.D.I.C. too, Mr. Sternlicht says: it will recover the full value of the Corus portfolio by working with him. "They are going to make a couple of billion," he says. "If they sold it outright, they would have lost money."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If all goes as planned, Mr. Sternlicht says, he and his investors are also positioned to do rather well themselves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SOME are skeptical of Mr. Sternlicht's projections. While real estate prices are no longer in free fall, a recovery still looks far away. Condo prices have plummeted since the 2006 peak, according to the National Association of Realtors - 43 percent in Miami and 55 percent in Las Vegas. In Los Angeles, they are off by 44 percent from their high three years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there's that $554 million price that the Sternlicht group ponied up to snare its portion of the Corus portfolio - it was 20 percent higher than its two closest competitors. "Everybody in the industry thinks Sternlicht overpaid," says Peter Zalewski, founder of Condo Vultures, a real estate brokerage and consulting firm in Bal Harbour, Fla.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nothing bothers Mr. Sternlicht more than the suggestion that he overpaid. "If I had to bid for it again, I'd pay more today," he says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Linus Wilson, a finance professor at the University of Louisiana, Lafayette, who has studied the F.D.I.C.'s real estate sales, says he thinks the price Mr. Sternlicht paid for Corus will hobble his returns. Mr. Wilson points out that 59 percent of the loans on Corus's books were no longer performing before the bank failed in September, meaning that they were generating virtually no income. Corus described another $558 million in the portfolio as "problem loans" that were near default.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wilson argues that if Mr. Sternlicht doesn't sell condos right away, he may have trouble making his first loan payment of $150 million that comes due in October 2011. "It is far from guaranteed that he and his investors will make money on this transaction," Mr. Wilson says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And before Mr. Sternlicht can even change the lobby furniture and the landscaping at many of these Corus-financed projects, his investor group has to prevail in a slew of foreclosure proceedings against developers who have defaulted on their loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of these exhausted borrowers are simply handing over the keys peacefully. Others are fighting back and asking a politically charged question: Why is the federal government offering low-interest financing to Mr. Sternlicht and his private equity partners when it could be helping struggling condo builders finish their projects, which are keeping hundreds of people employed?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sonny Astani, developer of one such project, the Concerto project in Los Angeles, says the government should support him rather than backing Mr. Sternlicht.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think Sternlicht is going to wind up flipping all this stuff in a year," Mr. Astani predicts. "There are going to be huge lawsuits and bad publicity. His investors are going to get sick of it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">YOU might not expect to find Barry Sternlicht selling condos in Miami in a recession. He is best known for creating <span class="companylink">Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts</span> Worldwide, a major hotelier that he built into a public company with $6 billion in annual revenue and brand names like Sheraton and Westin. He conjured up the Westin's signature Heavenly Bed and the W Hotel chain, which introduced hip, boutique inns to the masses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last real estate recession, in the early 1990s, Mr. Sternlicht laid the groundwork for his hotel empire by snapping up distressed properties. Now Mr. Sternlicht, who left <span class="companylink">Starwood Hotels</span> in 2005 after a dispute with the board of directors, is making a similar play with distressed condos in overbuilt cities like Miami, Las Vegas and Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tanned, fit and sitting on the couch of his office in Greenwich, Conn., he apologizes for his head cold and then starts a spirited defense of the Corus deal. The way he sees it, he and his partners are going to be the dominant players in all the cities where Corus poured its money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are going to be like the Saudis in all these markets," he says. "We have the lowest cost of production and all the oil. There's nothing else new under construction. In three years, when all the debris, all the clutter is done, we'll be the guys. We will have price control."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The key, he says, is the cheap F.D.I.C. financing. "That's the beauty of this investment," he says. "I can afford to wait. If I had high-ticker, 10 percent financing, which would probably be the market rate, I would have to dump stuff. The interest payments would be killing me."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sternlicht boasts about some properties on which his group holds the notes - like Terranea, a $475 million resort in Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif. "It's got the second-largest ballroom in Southern California," he says. "It's right on the water. It took 12 years to get the zoning."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other projects will need a bit of work. One of them, called One Las Vegas, is a condo project with five towers - only two of which have been completed - on the outskirts of the city. "It's a mess," says Norman Radow, founder of Radco Development Solutions, an expert on distressed real estate. "It's across the street from a trailer park. I guess it has views, but they are of the desert."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sternlicht is more charitable about the property in Las Vegas. "I think we are going to convert that one to rentals," he says. "The units are pretty nice. And the views are great."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, he adds, the Corus portfolio had already generated $400 million in cash. Therefore, he says, nobody should worry about his group's ability to cover its debt payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sternlicht says he is simply doing today what he did during the last real estate recession: amassing inexpensive real estate and finding ways to make it more desirable. "Barry likes to buy real estate by the pound and then find the value in it," says Robert Wennett, a Miami Beach developer who worked with him in the 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Harvard Business School graduate, Mr. Sternlicht spent the 1980s learning his trade at <span class="companylink">JMB Realty</span> in Chicago, a leading deal maker at the time. He was let go after the real estate market collapsed in 1989. So he ventured out on his own, raising $20 million from the wealthy Ziff and Burden families of New York and buying loans from the <span class="companylink">Resolution Trust Corporation</span>, which the federal government had created to mop up the real estate mess left from the savings-and-loan debacle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He journeyed to auctions and bid against guys in pickup trucks to buy the notes on apartment complexes at rock-bottom prices. He says one complex came with a llama farm and turned out to be a pretty good investment. The llama farmer, Mr. Sternlicht says, flew to Chicago to pay off a $1 million loan before Mr. Sternlicht could foreclose on it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also invested in hotels. In 1994, he bought the discounted debt on a publicly traded hotel company, Hotel Investors Trust, and used it to buy Westin Hotels. Then, in 1996, Mr. Sternlicht surprised Wall Street when he outmaneuvered the Hilton Hotel chain and bought <span class="companylink">ITT Sheraton</span> for $14 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"He was absolutely a minnow compared to Hilton," says Thomas Flexner, <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span>'s global head of real estate, who advised Mr. Sternlicht on this deal and many others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new hotel king became known for his obsession with details. He says that the "one time" he totally lost it was when he arrived at the W Hotel on Lake Shore Drive in Chicago and discovered that the foliage at the front door was dead. "I actually went over to the Smith &amp; Hawken store and bought furniture and plants for them," he says. "I didn't want to wait 18 months."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Barry doesn't delegate," Mr. Flexner says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sternlicht's tenure as the hotel company's C.E.O. would end badly. His friends say he wanted to relinquish his managerial duties and do deals. He recruited his successor, Steven Heyer, only to become disillusioned with him. The board didn't agree. So Mr. Sternlicht resigned in 2005. (Mr. Heyer left two years later.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sternlicht returned to Starwood Capital, his original investment vehicle, to do deals. But his timing couldn't have been worse. He raised a lot of money but couldn't seem to find his way. He tried to start an eco-friendly hotel chain called the 1, but nothing has come of that venture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also chased hotels and office buildings, but he says he couldn't bring himself to be the high bidder paying top dollar in such a frothy market. "I'm a distressed-real-estate guy," he explains. "I could make no sense of what was going on."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sternlicht&nbsp; says he was relieved when the real estate bubble burst. He had a ready stockpile of cash and a target in mind: Corus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once a plodding Chicago lender, Corus went into overdrive after Robert J. Glickman became its chief executive in 1984. It offered certificates of deposit with above-market interest rates to buyers on the Internet and lent the money that gushed in to developers. By 2006, Corus was the nation's foremost condo construction lender, says Matthew Anderson, a managing director of Foresight Analytics, a real estate consulting firm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the real estate market fell apart, busted loans piled up on the bank's books. "If you were in the real estate business, you know that this bank was going to fail," Mr. Sternlicht says. "It was just running out of time." (Mr. Glickman declined to be interviewed.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In March 2009, Mr. Sternlicht started forming a plan to buy the bank. Six months later, the government shut Corus and announced that it would sell its real estate loans in an auction, keeping a large part of the equity and offering potential buyers cheap financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The reason why we do it is to allow the F.D.I.C. to capture the asset management efficiencies and expertise that a sophisticated player in the market can bring to the table," says James Wigand, a senior official with the regulator. "It also allows us to participate in the recovery."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts say that structuring the deal that way was a smart move for the F.D.I.C. "Over all, I'd say it was a home run for Sheila Bair," says Chris Whalen, editor of Institutional Risk Analyst, referring to the F.D.I.C. chairwoman. "You have to remember how bad the markets were back then. She was trying to jump-start the resolution process."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And yet even now people continue to say Mr. Sternlicht overpaid. Dean S. Adler, the chief executive of Lubert-Adler Partners, one of the bidders who lost out in the Corus auction, calls his competitor a "brilliant" investor. But he says that the number that Mr. Sternlicht and his partners paid suggests that they either have a much more optimistic view about when the real estate market will recover or are willing to accept a lower return on the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That sort of talk rankles Mr. Sternlicht. He says Mr. Alder and his co-bidder, Related Companies, blew it by mispricing their offers. Mr. Sternlicht says he got a copy of their due diligence for the Corus auction and found that they anticipated spending hundreds of million of dollars to fix construction defects. He adds that he and his investors encountered none of these woes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Adler doesn't deny that he and Related expected problems. "That's why we didn't bid as much," he says. Related declined to comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr.Sternlicht also says he is having fewer problems than he expected with foreclosures. Rather than litigate, some developers with projects in default are handing over buildings and have agreed to stick around and help the new owners manage them and sell condos. One of them is <span class="companylink">Key International</span>, which developed the Mint condominiums in Miami with Corus money.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was a close call," the Key vice president Inigo Ardid says wearily. "I just decided it would be better to do a workout than have a fight and waste a lot of energy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others are proving more difficult. The Sternlicht group tried to foreclose on the unfinished Trump Fort Lauderdale Hotel and Condominium in Fort Lauderdale and ended up in a messy legal battle with the project's development group, SB Hotel Associates, as well as condo buyers who have sued to get their deposits back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there are the developers who see a larger political issue in Mr. Sternlicht's partnership with the F.D.I.C. Alessandro Feretti and Piero Salussolia are fighting to keep the Sternlicht group from foreclosing on Artecity, their condo development in South Beach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their lawyer, Thomas R. Lehman, links the Corus deal to the federal government's unpopular bank bailout. "It's all part of the government's program of picking the haves and the have-nots," he says. "Companies like <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> and Barry Sternlicht's Starwood are the haves. Developers like Alessandro and Piero are the have-nots."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sternlicht says that nothing could be further from the truth. "We are trying to protect the government's money," he says. "We are not acting in an evil, capricious manner."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides, he would rather talk about his plans to fix his new properties. To that end, he brandishes a picture of Lakefront Wharf, a fortress-like resort in Panama City, Fla., that looks as if it were built in the late 1960s in a former Soviet republic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sternlicht acknowledges that Laketown Wharf isn't exactly a W Hotel -- yet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This one needs a little aesthetic charm," he sighs. "The inside is even worse."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first signs of financial turmoil came at Riverton Houses in Harlem.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then came Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village on Manhattan's East Side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now a third complex built by Metropolitan Life in the 1940s for veterans and middle-class families has run into financial distress after being purchased by speculators during the recent real estate boom, The New York Times's Charles V. Bagli reported Saturday. The owners of the sprawling Parkmerced apartment complex in San Francisco announced this week that they would default on their $550 million mortgage, which comes due in October.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A partnership of Laurence Gluck of Stellar Management and the Rockpoint Group, which had already lost Riverton Houses in Harlem in March to foreclosure, put out a statement on Wednesday that placed their problems at the 3,221-unit Parkmerced in the context of the current economic downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The landscape has changed dramatically," P. J. Johnston, a spokesman for the owners, told The Times in an interview. "The economy has taken a major hit. Many properties are facing default."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But just like Riverton and Stuyvesant Town, the owners of Parkmerced sought to take advantage of a roaring market to replace rent-regulated residents with tenants able to pay far higher rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The owners in all three cases invested substantial sums in upgrading the aging buildings and renovating some apartments. But ultimately they failed to increase revenue enough to cover the debt payments on the properties, which were heavily leveraged. The recession did not help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's pretty interesting that they have all ended up in the same place," Andrew Florio, an analyst at <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>, a research firm, told The Times. "People assumed they could boost revenues by kicking people out and raising rents."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stellar told the more than 6,000 tenants at Parkmerced, which is spread over 115 acres on the south side of San Francisco, that life would go on as usual. They said they were negotiating with lenders, which include <span class="companylink">Deutsche Bank</span>, to restructure their debt and would continue with their $1.2 billion expansion proposal to nearly triple the number of apartments at Parkmerced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Phone calls will be answered and issues addressed, our maintenance team will respond to work orders, and the leasing team will continue to lease new apartments," Seth Mallen, an executive vice president for Stellar, said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But so far, lenders have been reluctant to acknowledge the losses and restructure deals that were struck during the boom. And analysts say it remains difficult for owners to refinance large properties at anywhere near the old terms. As Stellar points out, they are not alone; more than $150 billion in commercial loans like theirs have been transferred to special servicers who handle troubled debts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is $550 million in senior debt on Parkmerced and an additional $52 million in secondary loans, according to the owners, but it is not as heavily leveraged as Riverton or Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village. The default was bad news for the giant California public employees pension fund, Calpers, which invested in all three properties. Calpers has already written off a $500 million investment in Stuyvesant Town.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stellar and Rockpoint were forced to give up Riverton Houses after defaulting on $250 million in loans. And Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper, which had been bought by Tishman Speyer Properties and BlackRock Realty for $5.4 billion in 2006, is in foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All three deals had prompted an outcry from tenant advocates who bemoaned the loss of housing affordable to working and middle-class families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Bay Area, like New York City, continues to be one of the least affordable real estate markets in the country," Christopher Lund, a spokesman for the East Palo Alto Fair Rent Coalition, told The Times. "The Parkmerced is the largest multifamily complex in San Francisco and its 3,200 rent-stabilized units are a key part of the Bay Area's remaining affordable housing stock."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">MetLife</span> built Parkmerced, Stuyvesant Town, Riverton and a handful of other large complexes in the 1940s amid a national housing crisis in a remarkable effort to provide homes for returning veterans. At Stuyvesant Town, for instance, the company received special property tax exemptions in return for agreeing to build the complex, maintaining relatively low rents and limiting its annual profit to 6 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the start of the real estate boom in 2004, private equity firms began buying these kind of meat-and-potato complexes, which they had long eschewed in favor of luxury buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2005, Mr. Gluck and Rockpoint bought Riverton, a middle-class complex where more than 90 percent of the 1,200 apartments were rent-regulated. A year later, Mr. Gluck refinanced his debt with $250 million in loans, allowing him to modernize the lobbies, install new elevators and glass doors, landscape the center courtyard and pocket tens of millions in profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rents covered less than a third of the monthly debt payments. Mr. Gluck had estimated he could raise income substantially by converting half the apartments to market rates by December 2011. But by the time he neared default in August 2008, he had converted only 128. The lenders took back the complex at a foreclosure sale earlier this year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tishman Speyer and its partner bought Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village - 110 buildings with 11,227 apartments on 80 acres - from <span class="companylink">MetLife</span> in 2006, the largest deal ever for a single property. Their business plan was essentially the same as that of Stellar Management.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And like Stellar, they failed to replace rent-regulated residents with tenants willing to pay higher, market rents as rapidly as projected. The partners exhausted $890 million in reserve funds earlier this year. Lenders are now foreclosing on the property, whose value is estimated at about $1.9 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stellar and Rockpoint bought Parkmerced the same year they acquired Riverton.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">MetLife</span> built the complex between 1944 and 1952. It consists of 11 13-story buildings with 1,683 apartments and 1,538 two-story townhouses. Its original 206 acres are bound by San Francisco State University on the north, San Francisco Golf Club on the south and Lake Merced to the west.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">MetLife</span> sold the property to the real estate mogul Harry B. Helmsley for $40 million in 1970, two years after he acquired the Parkchester, another <span class="companylink">MetLife</span> complex in the Bronx with 12,271 apartments, for $90 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parkmerced entered a period of slow decline as Mr. Helmsley and a subsequent owner deferred maintenance and sold small parcels to San Francisco State, according to tenants and the current owners. Increasing numbers of students from San Francisco State have replaced families at the complex.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stellar bought the property in 2005 for $700 million and promptly announced a renovation program, spending, it says, $135 million on new elevators and sprinklers, renovating lobbies and upgrading vacant apartments with new kitchen cabinets and countertops. The units on the upper floors of the towers are now called "penthouses" and require special entry keys.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Stellar Management is probably the best manager we've lived under," Dorothy Lefkovits, who has lived with her husband Martin at Parkmerced for 15 years, told The Times. But some residents and tenant activists worry that Parkmerced rents will swell beyond the reach of the people for whom it was originally built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are also mixed reviews of Stellar's proposal, now under review by the city, to demolish the 1,538 townhouses to make way for up to 7,400 new apartments over 20 years. It is part of an plan to create a dense, environmentally sustainable community based on public transportation and wind turbines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, Stellar's lenders were forced to pay a $6 million tax bill last year when Stellar and its partner could not come up with the money, according to Realpoint, a debt rating agency. And rents in San Francisco have fallen by 8 percent or more, while vacancies are up at Parkmerced.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MONTCLAIR</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ONLY about three years after the market for super-high-end housing seemed to fall off a cliff, a $16.495 million house is being built at the edge of one here in Essex County.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The builders of the seven-bedroom eight-bath French Renaissance-style estate, going up on speculation on a site overlooking the breadth of Manhattan at Montclair's border with Cedar Grove, say its setting evokes that of a French chateau overlooking the Loire Valley.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It just doesn't make sense to us,'' said Roberta Plutzik Baldwin, a longtime Montclair broker and agent, adding that she was one of several local real estate specialists ''confused'' when they first saw the listing last month. ''Here? Well, maybe. Now? I don't get it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inventory of homes for sale has swelled at an unusual pace around the state this spring, as sellers who had waited out last year's miserable conditions burst forth -- or were forced -- to list their houses, according to analysts looking at multiple-listing statistics and brokers listening to their clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the most expensive houses have continued to take the longest to sell. For all houses in Essex, Montclair's county, there is currently a seven-month sales inventory, according to the Otteau Valuation Group, and for houses starting at $2.5 million, the figure is 20 months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are always people who have the money to afford something phenomenal and beyond compare,'' said Gerry-Jo Cranmer, a broker at Turpin Realtors in Bernardsville, who is marketing the mansion, at 32 Club Way in Montclair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm aware of what some of the local Montclair agents have been saying,'' she said, ''and it doesn't bother me one bit.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Land-sale records show that the investor building the house is Brian F. Martin, a media and marketing executive in his 30s who lives in Montclair, and who two years ago sold a majority interest in a company called Brand Connections for $150 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Around that time, according to public records, Mr. Martin paid $1.35 million for the first two acres of what would become the full five-acre parcel on Club Way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Contacted by telephone, Mr. Martin did not provide financial details about his purchase or project. But he recounted how it had come about. He was driving to the grocery store in Montclair on a crystal-clear day from his home in Roseland, where he lived, and kept getting ''magnificent glimpses'' of Manhattan from the tops of hilly streets on what is known as First Mountain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When I got home,'' he said, ''I went to my computer and typed in 'houses with views in Montclair.' The listing came up for this piece of property. I called my broker and went out there the same day.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lot was thick with trees and strewn with garbage, and until he and the broker made it to the edge of the cliff -- which is not actually reachable by road from Montclair -- the Manhattan panorama was not evident.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is nothing like this stunning view of the most beautiful city in the world,'' Mr. Martin said. ''Instantly, I began thinking about building a house that would draw people to it, that would be owned by a person who opened it up, so that many people could experience this unique spot.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Martin said he asked half a dozen prominent architects -- including Michael Graves and the firm Philip Johnson -- to consider a design for the property with that in mind. John B. Rubinstein of Rubinstein &amp;Scialla Associates in Livingston designed the house now under construction; with 24 rooms that each have views of the skyline across the football-field-size yard, gardens, and infinity pool that will be built to the edge of the cliff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">J.C.L. Contracting of Cedar Grove, which is doing the building, expects to complete the property -- with pool, cabana and six-car garage -- by the end of the year, said John Lehmann, the company president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The high-end market in Montclair has been showing some new life lately, with the return of multiple bidding. But agents noted that this occurred almost exclusively in the case of completely renovated, distinctive or historic houses offered for $1.2 million and under. It is not the trend for the top end hereabouts, or anywhere else in New Jersey, according to market watchers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The opposite,'' said Ms. Baldwin, a broker with Keller Williams Towne Square. ''At the upper end of the market, there are definitely more people wanting to get out than are trying to get in. ''Even on the showpiece streets here -- Upper Mountain, South Mountain, Prospect, Highland etc. -- some very impressive houses are just sitting on the market.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the mansion on First Mountain, the most expensive listing in Montclair is for a $4.2 million English manor home that belongs to the best-selling novelist Dorothea Benton Frank and her husband, Peter. The house, at 120 Lloyd Road, has been on the market for seven months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No house has ever sold for $4 million, said Linda Grotenstein, a veteran agent who works in the Montclair office of Coldwell Banker. The first $3 million-plus house sold in 2005, she said; in 2006, a house went for $3.5 million, and a house on Heller Drive sold for $3.65 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Montclair, which generally has a reputation as a home for artists, writers and musicians, also has its share of celebrities and entertainers, professional sports figures and chief executive officers, whom Ms. Cranmer described as the likely buyer pool for these high-priced homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the community has not exactly been a magnet for megastars in the way that some Bergen County towns have been. Alpine, for example, is home to Eddie Murphy and several New York Yankees, and Upper Saddle River, home to the best-known hip-hop stars, is where the singer Mary J. Blige reportedly paid $12.3 million in cash for a house on East Saddle River Road two years ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Cranmer, who says she has been selling ''luxury estates'' for more than 20 years, said: ''The best buyers always find their way to the best homes. This house, this view, will not go begging for a buyer, no matter what else is going on in the world around it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Correction: June 6, 2010, Sunday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The ''In the Region'' article last Sunday, about reactions to a mansion going up on speculation in Montclair, N.J., misstated the name of the real estate agency that has the listing. It is Turpin Realtors, not Jack Turpin Realty.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gary Barnett, one of New York City's most prolific developers, is about to start construction of a $1.3 billion skyscraper on 57th Street that will overtake Trump World Tower as the tallest residential building in the city.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tower, designed by the French architect Christian de Portzamparc, will rise 1,005 feet above 57th Street east of Seventh Avenue, feature striking views of Central Park and house what Mr. Barnett hopes will be 136 of the most expensive and luxurious apartments in the city. A 210-room Park Hyatt hotel is to occupy the first 20 floors, hotel analysts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're going vertical in the next three weeks,'' said Mr. Barnett, chief executive of Extell Development. Sounding a little like the developer he is one-upping, he said, ''We think it'll be the nicest project ever built in New York.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project is the first major construction start in New York since the fall of <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> in September 2008, and it is an ambitious, even risky undertaking. Unemployment still hovers at 10 percent in the city, which has only just begun to gain back some of the 150,000 jobs lost during the recession. Not so long ago, the real estate industry was right behind Wall Street and the nation's automakers in crying for a federal bailout.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Barnett and other real estate executives now say they are seeing signs of life, despite a sluggish economy, fears that the European debt crisis will drag down the stock market and a list of stalled residential projects in New York that runs 500 buildings long.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apartment prices and office rents have bottomed out, and landlords are having to offer fewer concessions, real estate executives say. Foreign investors are back, and wealthy people are buying property again. Tourists continue to pour into the city. Retailing is relatively strong, and hotel occupancy and rates are picking up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Hersha Hospitality Trust</span> has bought four Manhattan hotels since January for $200 million. In recent months, SL Green, the city's biggest commercial landlord, bought two office towers for a total of more than $500 million. And three developers are vying for a minority stake in 1 World Trade Center, which, upon its completion (scheduled for 2013), will be the city's tallest skyscraper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All these tentative signs of recovery could be extinguished by another downturn. But many are poised like sprinters for the starting gun on the next real estate bull market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a lot more activity,'' said Stephen M. Ross, chief executive of Related Companies, a prominent developer. ''It's not doom and gloom anymore.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Barnett said his project would be completed in 2013, in time for what he expects will be a booming market. The foundation for his tower, which will stand opposite Carnegie Hall and be called Carnegie 57, is complete.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With banks still largely unwilling to lend money for large projects, Mr. Barnett went to Abu Dhabi for partners and financing. The Tasameem Real Estate Company, controlled by the government, bought a stake in the project two years ago. More recently, a related company, Aabar Investment, agreed to provide financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the time the tower opens, Mr. Barnett said, there should be a ''dearth'' of spacious ultraluxury condominiums. It will loom nearly 500 feet over the Essex House and its rooftop neon sign, giving residents panoramic views.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the apartments should command prices comparable to or better than those at 15 Central Park West, a celebrity magnet that has attracted the likes of Sting and Alex Rodriguez and where apartments sell for $6,500 a square foot and more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you can find the money, it's a great time to be in development,'' Mr. Barnett said. ''We're not back to the highs of 2007 yet, but we see things picking up substantially.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently, Extell is building or completing five residential buildings on the West and East Sides with a total of 924 apartments. The company also plans to build a 54-story, 487-room hotel on West 45th Street, near Avenue of the Americas, but his 34-story Gem Tower, which is to house dealers in the Diamond District, has come to a temporary halt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan J. Miller, president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel, called Mr. Barnett's latest project ''pretty gutsy.'' Apartment prices leveled off last year, after falling by 25 percent to 30 percent, he said. The anemic market for the highest priced units has recently awakened, but mainly because those units have become more affordable. That could make a tall order out of Mr. Barnett's goal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three years from now, Mr. Miller said, developers and landlords may still be wrestling with an estimated 20,000 rental apartments and condominiums in buildings where construction or sales stopped in the past two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think things will be better than they are now,'' he said, ''but I don't know how much better. I don't think we're in recovery mode.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, many brokers and developers take heart from the fact that apartment buyers are back in the market. Pam Liebman, president of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, said the number of apartments under contract jumped 81 percent in the first quarter of this year, compared with the same period in 2009; it was lower, however, than during the peak in 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an industry where many believe that perception is reality, landlords, developers and real estate investors are now ''up-talking'' a market that they had been ''down-talking'' a year ago, as if a turnaround could be prompted by sheer force of will.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a palpable optimism in the market right now,'' said Robert A. Knakal of Massey Knakal Realty Services, a real estate sales broker.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No private developer is going to start building a speculative office tower anytime soon, but landlords and developers say the Midtown market is on the verge of a turnaround, even though the office vacancy rate is a daunting 14 percent. Effective rents, which had fallen by as much as 45 percent, are now inching upward, at least for first-class space, and concessions are shrinking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, there are few large blocks of vacant space available in Midtown. And, brokers say, <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>, <span class="companylink">UBS</span>, Bank of New York Mellon and <span class="companylink">Societe Generale</span> are each looking for at least 400,000 square feet. This is interpreted as a sign of confidence in the future, since banks and other corporations were fearful of making commitments a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We believe that the New York City commercial office market is finally turning the corner after a few difficult years,'' Marc Holliday, chief executive of SL Green, said this month after the company added two office buildings to its portfolio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Barnett said nothing short of a catastrophe would stop his project. ''We believe in New York City,'' he said. ''People are always going to want to live here.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite rosy news about job growth in New York and the prospect of a rebound in commercial real estate, the market's recovery could be delayed by a large amount of vacant office space that would normally be sublet or otherwise absorbed in a healthy market, new data show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the research firm CoStar Group, nearly 18 million square feet of unoccupied office space in Manhattan has not been factored into the market's vacancy rate. This so-called shadow space consists of individual desks as well as entire floors that are empty after layoffs and consolidations. Because these vacant areas are not for rent, they are not recorded anywhere and so are hard to pinpoint.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the economy improves and employment picks up, tenants will spend the next several years backfilling these shadow spaces before venturing into the leasing market. That will postpone a rise in commercial rents and drive down building values.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's no doubt that shadow space is going to mute a recovery,'' said Robert L. Freedman, the chairman of the tristate region for Colliers International, a commercial real estate firm. Mr. Freedman said he expected that rents would not rise for at least three years. The amount of shadow space will also weaken the investment sales market, said Robert A. Knakal, the chairman of Massey Knakal. Vacancy and positive absorption -- a net increase in demand for space -- ''are two of the most important metrics'' for building values, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CoStar determined the amount of shadow space by taking the unemployment figures in New York City from the first quarter of 2008 through the first quarter of 2010 -- roughly 104,000 jobs lost -- and multiplying this by 250 square feet, the industry standard for how much space each employee uses. This resulted in 26.1 million square feet that should have been vacated during the downturn. Instead, only 8.5 million square feet was put on the market -- a 17.6-million-square-foot discrepancy. This results in a vacancy rate of 11.2 percent rather than 7.9 percent, with roughly 15 additional quarters of growth needed to fill that space, according to CoStar.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have found that shadow space poses a real risk to recovery,'' said Aaron Jodka, a real estate economist at CoStar. ''And if anything, we are being conservative with these numbers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James P. Stuckey, a dean at the Schack Institute of Real Estate at New York University and a former executive vice president for the developer Forest City Ratner, agreed. ''These figures make sense. Shadow space is always an issue during downturns as companies grapple with how best to handle it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is normal for tenants to hold on to some shadow space, typically maintaining a 5 percent vacancy to give them flexibility for hiring or layoffs. The extent of the job losses in the city over the last few years, however, has pushed the shadow inventory to 10 percent for many tenants, leasing brokers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are several reasons companies hold onto this excess space, one of the most common being the difficulty of subdividing it and creating a contiguous block for lease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you have one million square feet spread across 25 floors, that shadow space may be a few seats here, a few offices there,'' said Robert J. Alexander, chairman of the tristate region for <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>. ''It would be really expensive to consolidate this.'' In addition, with office rents low, it is not clear that the tenant could even recoup their costs should they put the space on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps an even larger factor driving companies' decisions is the financial write-downs incurred when subleasing vacant space. When a tenant puts sublease space on the market, it must set aside a financial reserve to account for any projected losses between the rents they are paying and their sublease terms. This reserve depresses short-term earnings, something that many companies, especially those already under financial duress, are reluctant to do.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While it is nearly impossible to determine the magnitude of the write-downs for individual tenants, it is ''a very important component when big companies make decisions. They won't make a major strategic real estate decision until they understand the financial implications,'' said Robert Goodman, an executive managing director at Colliers International who spent several years at <span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span> and specializes in financial firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to subleasing shadow space, it is also possible to pay the landlord to get out of a lease term. This can be difficult to negotiate, since landlords are often unwilling to take a chance on finding a replacement tenant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, several tenants are now venturing into the market, and if they are successful, it could burn off some shadow inventory. <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span>, for example, is offering more than 130,000 square feet on three floors at 111 Wall Street, a building they own, according to CoStar. In addition, the <span class="companylink">CIT Group</span> is putting some 130,000 square feet at 505 Fifth Avenue on the market while <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span> is looking to shed in excess of 300,000 feet at 245 Park Avenue, said Cynthia Wasserberger, a managing director at <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps the most vulnerable area is Downtown Manhattan, which has roughly five million square feet of space available. ''Generally, downtown is going to experience more of an impact from all this shadow space than Midtown,'' Ms. Wasserberger said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> is vacating several buildings to move into its new headquarters, <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> is giving up a huge block at the World Financial Center, and both the <span class="companylink">American International Group</span> and <span class="companylink">JPMorgan Chase</span> are shedding offices. And there will be new space coming online at the World Trade Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Shadow space is difficult to determine, but any way you slice it, it is a significant factor in the recovery,'' said Benjamin F. Kursman, a partner at the law firm Herrick, Feinstein who specializes in leasing deals. ''Even as we see some green shoots in the economy, this is definitely going to be a drag on the resurgence of the commercial real estate market.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON (AP) -- Home sales in April surpassed expectations as government incentives provided a temporary lift to the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The National Association of Realtorssaid Monday that sales of previously owned homes rose 7.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.77 million. That was the best showing in five months and better than the 5.63 million units economists had expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase in sales ignited a rise in home prices. The median price for a new home rose to $173,100, up 4 percent from a year ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The federal government provided a lift to home sales this spring by offering first-time buyers a tax credit of up to $8,000. Homeowners looking to upgrade could qualify for a credit of up to $6,500. The deadline for getting a signed sales contract was April 30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales were up in all parts of the country except the West. The gains were led by a 21.1 percent jump in the Northeast and a 9.9 percent rise in the Midwest. Sales also rose 8.6 percent in the South.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The only region of the country where sales declined was the West, where sales dropped 6.2 percent from March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big question facing the housing market is what happens now that the government's tax credits have expired.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''No doubt there will be some temporary fallback in the months immediately after it expires,'' said Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the Realtors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Yun said that the improving economy had led to an upswing in consumer confidence, which should help support sales in the months ahead.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TRYING to pinpoint what's going on with the New York City real estate market right now can be like standing at the shoreline and determining the exact moment the tide turns -- without a tide chart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as sales pick up and open houses draw dozens of prospects instead of single-digit groups, one thing is clear: the rules of the game have changed -- in some ways, for good. The recession has brought about many of the biggest changes, like lower prices, tighter lending standards and historically low interest rates. But technology, too, has had a large impact on the way deals get done, giving everyone access to information that brokers once held close to the vest, and revealing details even they may not have known. (A buyer involved in multiple lawsuits? Thanks, <span class="companylink">Google</span>!) As buyers and sellers make their way down the path to move-in day, what once seemed like a well-marked highway has become more like a labyrinth. Here are guideposts that can help make sense of the maze:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MORTGAGE HURDLES</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there's one word that sums up the current mortgage application process, it's paperwork. And tighter lending standards mean that many buyers will need more of it. The traditional starting point for buyers has been securing a simple preapproval letter for a mortgage. Now lenders recommend having detailed discussions about a loan before heading to open houses. This way, you can get a jump on collecting all the documents the bank will want to see. ''Three years ago, I got a mortgage literally after conducting a phone call while I was driving,'' said Peter Hamarich, who closed on a studio apartment in Chelsea in April after he and his partner sold their one-bedroom near Lincoln Center. This time, though, things were different. ''I'd bet 90 percent of the documents we submitted we had to submit twice, or submit updated copies,'' Mr. Hamarich said. That paperwork includes tax returns, bank statements and pay stubs, all of which will probably have to be resubmitted as newer versions arrive during a process that can take up to six months. ''Putting the right paperwork together up front really can save you some trouble at the end of the transaction,'' said Bob Donovan, a senior vice president of <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>, which recently revamped its Web site to offer buyers more preapplication advice. Another change is that the mortgage commitment letter that banks give to buyers once they have a signed contract is now likely to have conditions attached -- meaning that before the bank will actually issue a check, you may have to undergo a more detailed review of your finances. An unusual deposit in your checking account, for instance, could raise questions about whether someone was helping you with the purchase. Richard Martin, a senior vice president of DE Capital Mortgage, said the goal of gathering up records early on was to head off questions later in the process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As loan officers, we have to be incredibly detailed and prepared to be able to answer these questions,'' Mr. Martin said. ''We've stepped into a whole new era in the mortgage business, which in a sense we'll never turn back from. All of this stuff is here to stay.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE SEARCH</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rule of thumb used to be that spring was the busiest time to buy or sell in New York City, but shifting financial winds have changed that pattern. ''Seasonality has been less important in the past couple years,'' said Kenneth Scheff, an executive vice president of Stribling &amp;Associates. ''It's more about the economic news. When the news is good and people feel more secure, there's a rush to buy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Scheff said pent-up demand led to a strong fourth quarter of 2009, and other brokers reported an earlier-than-usual flurry of spring shoppers hoping to take advantage of the home buyers' tax credit that expired at the end of April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was the motivation for Anne Hunnell Chen and her husband, Cory Chen, first-time buyers who started looking in January and closed on a two-bedroom apartment in lower Harlem on May 10. Although the apartment they bought was one of the first that they saw, they took their time before submitting a bid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think we came back to this place three times before we put in an offer,'' Ms. Hunnell Chen said. ''We spent a lot of time walking around the neighborhood, checking out the grocery stores and the commute and things like that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That care reflects today's more cautious buyers. In the boom years, people bought homes without thinking about how long they planned to live there or how long a property might take to sell. Some brokers say they are now advising clients to plan on staying put for at least five years -- or rent instead.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And when the time does come to sell (you have considered transaction costs, haven't you?), properties that will appeal to a broad base of buyers are looking better than ever.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andrew Bartfield, who accepted an offer in April on the Hell's Kitchen loft he put on the market in December, said that the apartment's open floor plan and setting in a converted armory were a draw when he bought it in 2003, but that ''glass and metal'' seemed like the hot thing now. Still, he is happy he has a deal and comfortable with the price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't think it's the same thing I would've gotten two years ago,'' Mr. Bartfield said. ''But I wasn't selling two years ago.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PRICING AND NEGOTIATING</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Probably no other factor has affected the negotiation process more than the wealth of real estate data now available online. Web sites like NYTimes.com, StreetEasy and Zillow let buyers in on previously guarded details like how many times a property's price has been cut, how long it has been on the market and how much the owner paid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few more mouse clicks might bring up the recent sales history of every apartment in a given building, and spirited discussions at sites like Brownstoner and Curbed can reveal things like whether a nearby school is noisy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Douglas Heddings, the founder of the Heddings Property Group and a blogger about industry ethics at TrueGotham.com, said the new availability of information had foiled some old tricks of the trade. ''Some brokers would take a listing off the market and put it back on as if it were new,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, buyers can see the history, and this type of data has given them new ammunition at the negotiating table.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What you're doing is playing poker,'' said Spencer Rascoff, the chief operating officer of Zillow. ''You want to have as much information as possible about what the other person is holding.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tools on Zillow help pinpoint market value by showing the listing discount -- the sales price compared to the last list price -- for similar properties that have recently changed hands. But for those tempted to lob a low-ball offer, brokers report that as prices have come down, deals are happening within 10 percent of the list price and that good, well-priced apartments can generate multiple offers since there are so few of these gems for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We kept hearing, 'It's a buyer's market' -- well, I'm not feeling that,'' said Wendy Weissman, who with her husband has been looking for a one-bedroom prewar apartment in a doorman building since September. They thought for a time in the winter that they had found what they were looking for. But that deal, an estate sale, fell through because the seller lacked a document showing that he was the sole owner, and they began house-hunting again in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When I first started to look,'' Ms. Weissman said, ''there seemed to be a lot more inventory. I don't know if we're asking for too much, but I just don't want to settle.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE CONTRACT</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When half a dozen buyers were rushing to outbid one another, the eagerness to get a contract signed could make the review process seem almost a formality. But banks are subjecting buildings as well as buyers to greater scrutiny, and lawyers are advising clients to do the same.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with the well-publicized reluctance of banks to finance purchases in new developments when they are less than 50 percent sold, standards on the financial health of older co-ops have tightened as well. Lenders prefer to see 10 percent of the property's outstanding mortgage in its reserve fund; they also favor owner-occupied buildings over ones with lots of renters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Wolsk, a real estate lawyer with Hartman &amp;Craven in Manhattan, said buyers should make sure their lawyers were undertaking similarly detailed due diligence. They should for instance ask about sublease rules and examine the building's financial statements, with an eye toward anomalies like an accounts-receivable change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Maybe a couple of owners have stopped paying their maintenance because they're protesting some leaks in the building,'' Mr. Wolsk said, adding that the minutes of board meetings could reveal issues like bedbugs, noise problems or an assessment under consideration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The biggest sticking point in contract negotiations, he said, is the closing date. Typically 60 to 90 days after the contract is signed, it is subject to delays: a seller who is not ready to move, or a bank that is not ready to issue a check. Most contracts now have a clause making the deal contingent upon the buyer's getting a mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Three or four years ago, contracts had no contingencies,'' said Dottie Herman, the president of Prudential Douglas Elliman. ''Now, sellers are more amenable to having a mortgage contingency because most attorneys for buyers say we're not going to let you sign a contract without one.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">GETTING TO CLOSING</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If there were a sign flashing above the road to the closing it would read, ''Be prepared for delays.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The single thing that's extending the period from contract to closing is the lenders,'' said Jesse Gordon, a real estate lawyer at Costello &amp;Gordon in Manhattan, explaining that any conditions in the commitment letter must be addressed before the lender issues a check -- and that these conditions could multiply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You meet one condition, whether that be providing copies of tax returns or a gift letter, and that leads to five more conditions that need to be satisfied,'' he said, citing as an example questions about deductions on a tax return.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Appraisals that come in too low and rejections by newly cautious co-op boards are also scuttling deals. In Manhattan, about 65 contracts a month are falling through, according to reports collected by StreetEasy. So buyers should not necessarily feel excluded by an ''in contract'' stamp on a listing, or be surprised if a broker does not add that label to a property that has an accepted offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When we contact the broker, usually the broker says, 'I'm showing it for backup,' '' said Michael Smith, the chief executive of StreetEasy, who joked that there should be a new label saying, ''in a committed relationship, but interviewing others.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for all the ways the real estate game has changed, with higher hurdles to jump and a longer course to run, many brokers say that the new data transparency and due diligence in financing have contributed to a healthier housing market for buyers and sellers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a new day out there,'' said Diane M. Ramirez, the president of Halstead Properties. ''I think we have had some good eye-opening days, and it's probably going to serve all of us long term.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHOTOS: NEW TERRAIN: When they went house-hunting, Anne Hunnell Chen and her husband, Cory Chen, top, were, like many buyers today, very careful.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AS co-op boards across the city head into annual meeting season, many are facing a paradox: despite the real estate market's decline, building assessments and real estate taxes have continued to go up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Property managers say most buildings are facing maintenance increases of 5 to 7 percent this year, with taxes responsible for the bulk of the increases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Real estate taxes are continuing to hammer building budgets,'' said Stuart Smolar, the executive director of the Andrews Building Corporation, which manages more than 300 apartment buildings. He and other property managers said that real estate tax increases this year ranged from 10 to 25 percent, and that combined with similar increases in previous years, they could easily add up to tax increases of more than 60 percent since 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A policy of phasing in assessments -- meant to protect property owners from drastic tax increases when the market is strong and property values are rising very quickly -- is now prolonging the pain for buildings even though values have dropped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of people don't realize that assessments are phased in over five years,'' said David Kuperberg, the chief executive of Cooper Square Realty, which manages about 400 apartment buildings. ''We're getting increases in 2010 from valuations that were done in 2006 at the height of the market.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added that with City Hall having to make major cuts to balance its budget, ''the city needs money, so it's not making great offers when you challenge an assessment.'' Most buildings have routinely filed tax assessment challenges every year and waited for the city to offer lower assessments, Mr. Kuperberg said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But now you can't just do it in a perfunctory way,'' he said. ''You have to be prepared to show up at a hearing and present a strong case and clearly document why the assessment is wrong.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Higher taxes, coupled with slower apartment sales, have forced many buildings to hunt for ways to increase revenue. Some have opted to raise one-time charges like flip taxes or move-in and renovation fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a traditional way of increasing revenues,'' said Paul Gottsegen, the president of the Halstead Management Company, which manages more than 180 buildings in the city. ''Buildings are maxing out wherever they can for fees.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, he said, buildings that charged a $1,000 move-in fee are raising it to $2,500, because that ''seems to be the number that they can get away with.'' Buildings that had 2 percent flip taxes -- paid to the building by the seller when an apartment is sold -- are raising them to 3 percent. Renovation fees, also known as good neighbor fees, are going up to $1,500 a month in many buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In high-end buildings on Park Avenue, renovation fees have long run as high as $10,000 a month. Some of these buildings have raised these fees to $400 a day from $300, said Daniel Wollman, the chief executive of Gumley Haft Real Estate Management, which manages about 80 buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even with that troubled financial outlook, Mr. Wollman says that most co-ops can expect fairly routine annual meetings. ''But,'' he said, ''there will be a little more conversation about money pressures, because that's just how it is. People's sensitivities to that are higher today.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as the market seems to have stopped its decline and has even shown some signs of recovery, some co-op boards are considering ways to make sure the apartments in their buildings can capture the highest sales prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They're asking, 'What are we doing to maximize the value of our property?' '' said Jim O'Connor, the president of Douglas Elliman Property Management, which manages about 325 apartment buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Last year was the ultimate wait-and-see year and nobody was willing to do anything,'' he said. ''Now people are thinking maybe it's time to do hallway or lobby renovations or maybe an elevator modernization.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Herman, the president of the residential management division at Brown Harris Stevens, said that there was ''pressure last year not to do projects that weren't absolutely essential.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Improving a building's curb appeal and giving its public spaces a face-lift can help it stand out among comparable buildings and ultimately improve property values, Mr. Herman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's precisely what is happening at Roz Harris's building at the corner of East 18th Street and Irving Place. Ms. Harris, who has been on the board of the 16-story white-brick building for six years, said the building renovated its lower lobby about four years ago, but put off restoring the upper lobby where the doorman's desk sits and building a new closet for packages and dry cleaning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We maintain a list of must-dos like the roof or the boiler and a wish list,'' Ms. Harris said. ''This was on the wish list, but we tabled it last year because we got socked with a huge water bill and a huge increase in real estate taxes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this year, the building received a tax refund after successfully challenging assessments from 2003 through 2005. ''So now we're open to it again and we might open the purse strings and spend a little money,'' Ms. Harris said. ''We haven't put contracts out for bid yet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Original plans for the upper lobby required custom millwork that would have cost as much as $80,000, but the board is now considering scaled-down renovations that would run about $20,000. ''We're looking at a much smaller expenditure than what we had originally planned,'' Ms. Harris said. ''We're not going to go crazy here.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Riguardi, 49, is the president of the New York operations of <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>, a publicly traded company based in Chicago and one of the world's largest commercial real estate brokers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, one of his deals included the 550,000-square-foot lease renewal at 1285 Avenue of the Americas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q How's business?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Business is very good. Last year at this time there was a lot of trepidation. In 2010 we see the economy and the real estate market strengthening, and our businesses representing that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q You believe we're well past the bottom then?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A In some places we're moving away, and some places we'll probably linger around the bottom a little bit. A testimony that the markets have hit the bottom is that the concession packages stop increasing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q What would a typical package include these days?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A A good rule of thumb might be about a month free rent per year of a lease, topping out at a year's free rent, and the work allowances (for tenants redoing the space themselves) are anywhere from $40 to $50 per square foot. A year ago, we probably saw more like a month and quarter of free rent per year and maybe work allowance in the $60- to $70-per-square-foot range.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Are rental rates rising?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A The Midtown Class A space is probably trading about 20 percent less than the peak two years ago, but it's trending up from where it was last year. We're starting to see some $115 or $120 rents in elite Park Avenue or Plaza District buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Lower Manhattan, it depends. There hasn't been a sustainable amount of leasing activity to draw opinion on it. But I think we're going to see a wave of activity in the financial center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Speaking of downtown, Jones Lang has been hired by the Port Authority, along with Cushman &amp;Wakefield, to handle negotiations with prospective partners for One World Trade Center. Where does that effort stand?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A We're talking to developers to be a fee-based adviser on the completion in the marketing of One World Trade Center. We're looking to get their expertise. The teams have short-listed the developers to four.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Who are they?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A The top four would be Durst, Related, Boston Properties and Hines. A decision might come perhaps by the summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q You represented the first tenant of One World Trade Center, Beijing Vantone Industrial, in its deal to lease 191,000 square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A One of the most challenging deals I ever did was representing the Chinese at the World Trade Center, because it took a few tries to get the deal completed. But the most challenging things at the end of the day when they're completed could be some of the most rewarding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Any concern that the added office space around ground zero might create a market glut?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A I think this market has flourished around 420 million square feet. It could easily add 10 million or more to it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Tell me about other recent big deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A We represented the landlord at 1285 Avenue of the Americas, with the law firm Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton &amp;Garrison. We represented the landlord at Black Rock; we did the Orrik Herrington &amp;Sutcliffe deal. We represented General Motors in renewing their lease at the General Motors Building. We represent Jet Blue on their headquarters, and hopefully, that'll finish up shortly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q There have been some changes in the brokerage world lately, with the recent merger of Colliers and FirstService Real Estate, for example. Does Jones Lang have its eye on any competing firm?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A We're never targeting firms -- they're all good firms -- but if we could find people that would like to be with us, then we'll take advantage of that. We recently improved our position in the investment-sales area, where we brought over a big team from Cushman &amp;Wakefield. Last year we improved our brokerage depth by bringing over a team from Newmark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Do you see further consolidation in the industry?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A I have nothing to say about that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Why all the sports memorabilia in your office?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A My wife likes to say I'm knowledgeable about two things: baseball and real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I love sports -- I played baseball up until college -- and I have four sons and they love sports. It's a good way for me to relax and to entertain for business by taking people to a hockey game or a baseball game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Whom do you root for?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A I'm a Mets-Rangers-Jets fan.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Postscript: May 22, 2010</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Late Friday, after the following article went to press, The New York Times learned that the developers of Stone Ridge had canceled plans to auction the condominiums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an e-mail message to prospective buyers announcing the cancellation, the developers wrote:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We listened carefully and with great interest over the last couple of weeks. What we have learned from your response is that the vast majority of interested buyers are extremely well informed and sophisticated and prefer a more personalized and less pressure-filled private sales process. As a result, we have canceled the Stone Ridge at Fairfield auction, and instead, will transition into a conventional sales program, with new prices that reflect your input and present market realities. You will now have the opportunity to meet with our sales team one-on-one to purchase the home of your choice.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Original Article</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE 15 condominiums that have sat unsold for years at the Stone Ridge complex in Fairfield don't look like leftovers. Scattered throughout three buildings in a gated development equipped with a gym, a club room and a concierge, they have the same 10-foot ceilings, walnut floors and magazine-perfect kitchens as the 55 occupied units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, the project's developers are auctioning the units at deep discounts, hoping that by stimulating a skittish market they will be able to close out a project begun back in 2004. The one-day auction, scheduled for Sunday, will open with minimum bids 44 to 55 percent below previous asking prices. A two-bedroom two-bath condo, for instance, will start at $339,000, as opposed to the original price tag of at least $645,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The low minimums are designed to lure enough potential buyers to bid up the prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't know if we're going to sell them for the minimum bids,'' said Robert S. Skolnick, a partner in the Stone Ridge development, adding, ''I hope not.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a gamble -- whether the market will favor the developer or a few fortunate buyers won't be known until after the auction at the Hilton in Stamford. (Registration is at noon; the auction begins at 1.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But some developers have been willing to take that risk, given that their alternative is to continue to wait out the slack market. Stone Ridge is at least the third Fairfield County condo project in less than a year to use an auction to clean up inventory, allowing the developer to pay off lenders or free up capital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Sheldon Good &amp;Company</span> conducted two earlier auctions. Last September, E/N Properties of Stamford put 19 one- and two-bedroom lofts at Lofts 881, in downtown Bridgeport, up for bid. And just last month, Seaboard Properties auctioned nine condominiums at Clocktower Close, a converted factory in Norwalk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The market is suspect of pricing right now,'' said Sue Hawkes, the chief executive officer of Velocity Marketing Services of Boston, the company hired to conduct the Stone Ridge auction. ''In an auction, the market has the opportunity to set the price. That's where buyers are very comfortable pulling the trigger. You can see the person bidding against you. It's transparent, and there's a greater comfort level.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the current pace of sales of high-end condos, Mr. Skolnick estimates it could take a few years for the market to absorb the remaining Stone Ridge units. From February through April, only 19 condos sold in Fairfield, at a median price of $325,000, according to figures provided by William Raveis Real Estate. More than 100 condos are for sale there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, smiling hostesses from Velocity Marketing were posted throughout the Stone Ridge complex, welcoming visitors to the available apartments. Ms. Hawkes said about 300 people had come through so far, a promising sign for the auction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a numbers game,'' she said. ''It's all about generating traffic.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jason Epstein was similarly optimistic going into the September auction for his downtown Bridgeport project, Lofts 881. City-backed efforts to revive the downtown had looked promising when Mr. Epstein began converting the office building on Lafayette Boulevard around 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As sales began in 2006, however, Mr. Epstein, along with other downtown developers, ran into a market slowdown. With about half of the 40 lofts in the red-brick building sold by last fall, he decided to try an auction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nineteen lofts, with granite counters, bamboo floors and access to a roof deck, were offered at 40 percent discounts: $137,000 for a 700-square-foot model, $205,000 for 1,400 square feet. About 50 people turned out for the auction at a Trumbull hotel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As soon as they started to bid, Mr. Epstein knew he was in trouble. Units were selling for the bare minimums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I remember sitting there and feeling almost numb,'' he said. ''This was like five years of work that just ended right there. At one point in the auction we had enough pain and we decided to stop it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he left the auction that day, he thought the 10 lofts that had sold had gone too cheaply. Eight months later, however, in competition with more than 300 other condos for sale in Bridgeport, he's marketing the last five at the same price points.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The auction people usually tell you what happens in the room is what the market is,'' Mr. Epstein said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The market sent a similar message to Seaboard Properties at the auction of nine units at Clocktower Close. The terms of the auction required Seaboard to sell at least four units at the lower bid levels, and it did, according to Jeffrey Hubbard, the senior managing director of Sheldon Good. Three other bids were accepted with reserve, meaning Seaboard could later reject them. Mr. Hubbard said he did not know the outcome, and Seaboard did not respond to several requests for comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stone Ridge was originally marketed as an investment opportunity. Across the street, a train station was in the works as part of a $250 million transit-oriented commercial project. But the economic downturn held up that project for years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, with the help of state and federal funds, the train platforms are under construction. For buyers, Mr. Skolnick said, the tangible progress ought to provide confidence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, for the residents who bought at much higher prices, probably a small degree of relief.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Postscript: May 30, 2010, Sunday</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ''In the Region'' article in Connecticut and Westchester copies last Sunday, about cases in which some developers have decided to auction off new condominiums because of the poor sales climate, reported on an auction scheduled last Sunday for 15 unsold condos at the Stone Ridge complex in Fairfield. After the section had gone to press, the developers canceled the auction, in part because advance registrants indicated discomfort with the bidding process.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON (AP) -- Construction of new homes rose more than expected in April, but new building permits fell sharply, the Commerce Department said Tuesday, signaling that the building industry's rebound could be short-lived.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report said construction of new homes and apartments rose 5.8 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 672,000. The results were the highest since October 2008 and were driven by a 10 percent increase in the single-family market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had expected construction to rise more modestly to a rate of 650,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building permits, a gauge of future activity, sank 11.5 percent to an annual rate of 606,000, the lowest since October 2009. Analysts were expecting a slight decline to a rate of 680,000.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Home Building Gained in April, Strengthened by the Tax Credit for Buyers</span>
</div><div class="author">By CHRISTINE HAUSER </div><div>757 words</div><div>19 May 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home building rose in April, government figures showed on Tuesday, as activity was possibly spurred by an $8,000 government tax credit for new buyers. But the data suggested that builders might also be slowing their future construction plans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department said work started on 672,000 homes in April, up 5.8 percent from March. It was the highest number of housing starts since October 2008 and slightly ahead of analysts' expectations. It also showed a 40.9 percent gain compared with April 2009, when housing starts were 477,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Building of single-family homes also went up, rising 10.2 percent in April from March, the department said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The end of the tax credit for first-time homebuyers, which had been extended from November through April for sales of houses that close by the end of June, might have had an effect on the numbers, economists said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is little doubt the housing numbers have been boosted by the second expiration of the first-time home buyers credit,'' said Dan Greenhaus, the chief economic strategist for Miller Tabak &amp;Company, in a research note.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase in building starts appears to show that builders were setting up for a busy spring, but a decline in the number of building permits issued indicates that some did not follow through, said Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist, Mizuho Securities USA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Construction plans fell to their lowest levels so far this year, possibly from overbuilding. Permits for multifamily homes declined 11.5 percent in April, to 606,000 units, from a revised rate of 685,000 units in March, the figures showed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Permits for single-family homes fell by 10.7 percent, to 484,000, from 542,000 in March. This is a significant number because it is not affected by seasonality and it gives an indication of future plans. Most of the permits were issued for construction in the South. Single-family permits were down in all four regions of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The builders overestimated,'' said Patrick Newport, an economist at IHS Global Insight. ''They thought they would sell more because of the tax credit.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Newport said that the multifamily housing construction market, which is part of the commercial real estate market, was being hit hard by high vacancy rates, low rental rates and difficulties getting financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Over all, I think it was a disappointing report,'' said Mr. Newport. ''I was expecting stronger numbers. I thought that they were also being driven by other forces such as job growth.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The numbers are an important indicator of economic growth, because of the associated purchases of materials and hiring of labor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the report suggests a recovery compared with last year, ''home builders are not seeing a dramatic recovery in demand, but rather have seen only very modest progress from record low levels,'' said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist for MFR Inc.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A separate report from the Labor Department showed that producer prices fell by 0.1 percent in April as food and energy costs declined.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Food prices fell by 0.2 percent, the first decline in nine months, and energy prices were down 0.8 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The core producer price, which excludes food and energy, increased by 0.2 percent in April compared with March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is still pretty tame,'' said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at the <span class="companylink">PNC Financial Services Group</span> in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compared with a year earlier, prices were up 5.5 percent, and excluding food and energy, the rate was 1 percent higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The message we are getting is inflation is a little further back in the pipeline,'' said Mr. Hoffman. ''There is pretty much an absence of any inflationary pressures.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he expected the index to drop further this month as oil prices come down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data was not expected to have an impact on the government outlook for relatively low levels of inflation for the near future. The Federal Reserve has kept interest rates low to stimulate growth as the economy struggles to recover in the face of unemployment of nearly 10 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Greenhaus said inflationary pressures were ''quite benign.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That is not to say nothing is going up in price,'' he wrote in a research note. ''Just that inflation, as measured by the government, is nowhere to be seen.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Wall Street denizens thought they could escape the specter of Justice Department inquiries by decamping to the Hamptons, it appears they're wrong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate listings in the Hamptons are the subject of a Justice Department inquiry, The New York Times and Bloomberg News reported Wednesday, keying off an earlier article in The New York Post.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several Hamptons real estate executives told The Times on Tuesday that they had been contacted by Justice Department officials seeking information about a listing service that has been criticized as an effort to keep smaller agencies from having access to the area's best properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The service, known as Realnet, allows members to share their listings with other members. Last year, George Simpson, who runs his own real estate listing company, sued more than two dozen local brokerages and Realnet. Mr. Simpson said that because only larger brokerages could afford the annual fee, which he said ranged from $15,000 to $50,000, those brokerages ultimately controlled "80 percent to 90 percent of the exclusive real estate listings."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stakes for brokerages are big, and apparently getting bigger, according to Bloomberg:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hamptons home sales more than doubled in the first quarter, the biggest annual increase in seven years of record keeping, according an April 22 report by New York-based appraiser Miller Samuel Inc. and broker Prudential Douglas Elliman Real Estate. A shift toward larger, more expensive homes pushed the median price up 35 percent to $908,500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three brokerages named in the lawsuit - <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>, Brown Harris Stevens and Prudential Douglas Elliman - declined to comment or did not return calls, The Times said. Realnet did not return a call and an e-mail message seeking comment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The question I think the Justice Department is asking is: Are they putting their own profits ahead of what they should be doing for the clients?" Jonathan Lerner, a managing director at the Engel &amp; Volker brokerage, told Bloomberg.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gina Talamona, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, also declined to comment about the inquiry to The Times and Bloomberg.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By August, Mr. Simpson had withdrawn his lawsuit and said that he planned to refile his case under "different circumstances" and continue "moving forward with the crusade."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the original case apparently caught the attention of Justice Department officials. Mr. Simpson told The Times that in the past month, he spoke for 90 minutes by telephone with several department employees about the structure of the real estate industry in the Hamptons and which firms dominated the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Members of a multiple listing service post their sales listings for other members to see; nonmembers could be at a disadvantage because sellers generally prefer to have their homes placed on listing services and exposed to as many potential buyers as possible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Nickles, a broker based in Southold and the chairman of the multiple listing service for the Hamptons and North Fork Realtors Association, told The Times that he was interviewed on May 5 by two Justice Department lawyers, an economist and a paralegal. Mr. Nickles said that his brokerage could not afford the more expensive system; he pays $160 a month for access to the local multiple listing service that he leads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joe Kazickas, owner of an Easthampton real estate company that runs a Web site called Hamptonsrentals.com, said he was scheduled to speak to Justice Department officials on May 24. He said that smaller brokerages that could not pay for the costlier listing database would find it "very difficult to compete."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LAS VEGAS -- In a plastic tent under a glorious desert sky, Richard Lee preached the gospel of the second chance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chance to make money on the next housing boom ''is like it's never been,'' Mr. Lee, a real estate promoter, assured a crowd of agents, investors and bankers. ''We're going to come back like you've never seen us before.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home prices in Las Vegas are down by 60 percent from 2006 in one of the steepest descents in modern times. There are 9,517 spanking new houses sitting empty. An additional 5,600 homes were repossessed by lenders in the first three months of this year and could soon be for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet builders here are putting up 1,100 homes, and they are frantically buying lots for even more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Las Vegas is trying to recover by building what it does not need. It is an unlikely pattern being repeated in many of the areas where the housing crash was most severe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a surprising rebound in the hardest-hit markets,'' said Brad Hunter, chief economist with the consultant Metrostudy. ''People are buying again.'' From the recession's lows, construction has nearly doubled in Las Vegas, Phoenix and Tucson. It is up 74 percent in inland Southern California and soaring in Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the demand is coming from families that are getting shut out of the bidding for foreclosures by syndicates that pay in cash, and some is from investors who are back on the prowl.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Land and labor costs have fallen significantly, so the newest homes are competitively priced. Some of the boom-era homes, meanwhile, are in developments that feel like ghost towns. And many Americans will always believe the latest model of something is their only option, an attitude builders are doing their utmost to reinforce.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Phoenix, a billboard for <span class="companylink">Fulton Homes</span> summed up the builders' marketing approach. ''Does your foreclosure have tenants?'' it asks, next to a picture of a mammoth cockroach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brent Anderson, a marketing executive with another Southwest builder, <span class="companylink">Meritage Homes</span>, said it bought 713 lots in stricken Arizona last year, and was on the verge of starting construction in a new Phoenix community called Lyon's Gate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're building them because we're selling them,'' Mr. Anderson said. ''Our customers wouldn't care if there were 50 homes in an established neighborhood of 1980 or 1990 vintage, all foreclosed, empty and for sale at $10,000 less. They want new. And what are we going to do, let someone else build it?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of this goes contrary to the conventional wisdom, which suggests an improved market for builders is years away. Nationwide, new home sales at the beginning of this year plunged to a level below any recorded since 1963, when the figures were first officially tabulated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Simply put, the country already has too many houses, the legacy of wide-scale overbuilding during the boom. The Census Bureau says there are two million vacant homes for sale, about double the historical level. Fewer new households, moreover, are being formed as families double up for economic reasons, putting a further brake on demand.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even some builders agree with the pessimists when it comes to Las Vegas. <span class="companylink">Meritage Homes</span>, for example, has largely withdrawn from the city. ''We don't think it will come back for a long time,'' Mr. Anderson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American West is betting the opposite is true. The developer, which is privately held and is based here, builds nowhere else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The evening under the tent with Mr. Lee was the official start of American West's new community, called Reserve at Coronado Ranch. Before it opened, buyers began putting down money for the houses, which sell for under $300,000. ''For the first time in three or four years, we have pent-up demand,'' said American West's vice president for sales, Jeff Canarelli.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Disregard what you may have heard about how hard times may usher in an era of restraint. ''With our buyers, they always want bigger,'' Mr. Canarelli said. An American West home introduced during the recession comes equipped with an elevator.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the initial buyers at Reserve is Josh Snider, a surgical technologist who decided a year ago he wanted to buy his first home. He sought out a foreclosure, deals that were supposedly plentiful and cheap. ''What a nightmare that was,'' recalled Mr. Snider, 38. ''I put in five or six offers and was always outbid.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He didn't see any homes that were being sold by buyers in the traditional way. The price declines in Las Vegas have been so brutal that most homeowners with a mortgage owe more than their home is worth. If they must sell, their only option is a so-called short sale done with the approval of the lender, which can be a lengthy and frustrating process for all concerned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Worried the market was going to turn around before he bought, Mr. Snider started checking out the new developments. He liked the floor plan, size and price of Reserve, which ultimately will have 310 houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A final incentive sealed the deal, this one courtesy of the United States government: he got a loan insured by the Federal Housing Administration, which meant his down payment was much smaller than a private lender would require.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The house, to be done in September, cost $273,500. ''It's not a bargain for everyone,'' Mr. Snider said, ''but it's a bargain for me.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He plans to live in the house with his girlfriend, Cindy Rojas, and his 12-year-old daughter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another early buyer is Irving Hallman, an investor from Hawaii. ''I understand Vegas has its ups and downs, but we did the numbers and this house will hold its value,'' Mr. Hallman said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a benefit to the seeming madness in places like Las Vegas. Building homes is the traditional fuel of a recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Housing is construction. It's tables. It's paint. It's couches. It's toilets,'' said Sally Taylor, a specialist in liquor and gambling establishments who attended the American West festivities. ''If we build more houses, we're creating more jobs.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Across the street from Reserve's three model homes is a new strip mall. Only one building is occupied, a gambling parlor. Others will start to be filled when more buyers join Mr. Snider and Mr. Hallman finds a renter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts have calculated that it could take as long as a decade for inventories to return to their precrash levels and for demand to once again exceed supply. That is a grim prospect for any owner who hopes to accrue equity through rising prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few experts, however, are starting to think the path to a better market will be much shorter. Stephen F. Auth, chief investment officer at the financial services company Federated Investors, is a housing bull. He says he does not believe that many extended families will end up all living in one place, like the Waltons in the 1930s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's an unsustainable environment -- Grandma coming home, Johnny moving back in with his new wife,'' Mr. Auth said. ''They're going to move back out. The great housing depression is nearly over.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New-home sales in March rose 27 percent. But most analysts attributed the jump to the pending expiration of yet another government incentive, a tax credit for buyers, and said sales would quickly slump again.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in Las Vegas, a community built on the willingness to be lucky, belief in a housing turnaround -- and Mr. Lee's portrait of a resilient city on its way to being a global ''meetspace'' -- is provisional. Agents at the party said they had their hopes but were chastened by the horrors of the last three years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Afterward, packing up his video equipment, Mr. Lee said the party itself heralded a recovery. ''We used to do this every two weeks, starting in the 1990s,'' he said. ''But this is the first time in 18 months. Believe me, it's been famine around here.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever you may think progress looks like -- a rebounding stock market, a new house, a good raise -- the governments of the world have long held the view that only one statistic, the measure of gross domestic product, can really show whether things seem to be getting better or getting worse. G.D.P. is an index of a country's entire economic output -- a tally of, among many other things, manufacturers' shipments, farmers' harvests, retail sales and construction spending. It's a figure that compresses the immensity of a national economy into a single data point of surpassing density. The conventional feeling about G.D.P. is that the more it grows, the better a country and its citizens are doing. In the U.S., economic activity plummeted at the start of 2009 and only started moving up during the second half of the year. Apparently things are moving in that direction still. In the first quarter of this year, the economy again expanded, this time by an annual rate of about 3.2 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All the same, it has been a difficult few years for G.D.P. For decades, academics and gadflies have been critical of the measure, suggesting that it is an inaccurate and misleading gauge of prosperity. What has changed more recently is that G.D.P. has been actively challenged by a variety of world leaders, especially in Europe, as well as by a number of international groups, like the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The G.D.P., according to arguments I heard from economists as far afield as Italy, France and Canada, has not only failed to capture the well-being of a 21st-century society but has also skewed global political objectives toward the single-minded pursuit of economic growth. ''The economists messed everything up,'' Alex Michalos, a former chancellor at the University of Northern British Columbia, told me recently when I was in Toronto to hear his presentation on the Canadian Index of Well-Being. The index is making its debut this year as a counterweight to the monolithic gross domestic product numbers. ''The main barrier to getting progress has been that statistical agencies around the world are run by economists and statisticians,'' Michalos said. ''And they are not people who are comfortable with human beings.'' The fundamental national measure they employ, he added, tells us a good deal about the economy but almost nothing about the specific things in our lives that really matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the U.S., one challenge to the G.D.P. is coming not from a single new index, or even a dozen new measures, but from several hundred new measures -- accessible free online for anyone to see, all updated regularly. Such a system of national measurements, known as State of the USA, will go live online this summer. Its arrival comes at an opportune moment, but it has been a long time in the works. In 2003, a government official named Chris Hoenig was working at the U.S. Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, and running a group that was researching ways to evaluate national progress. Since 2007, when the project became independent and took the name State of the USA, Hoenig has been guided by the advice of the National Academy of Sciences, an all-star board from the academic and business worlds and a number of former leaders of federal statistical agencies. Some of the country's elite philanthropies -- including the Hewlett, MacArthur and Rockefeller foundations -- have provided grants to help get the project started.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Things have evolved since then. When I first visited Hoenig in Washington early last winter, State of the USA was a willfully obscure, nonpartisan, nonprofit organization operating out of an unremarkable office building near DuPont Circle. Hoenig was amassing data on subjects like Americans' education and health and getting ready to put the information online. But tucked inside the health care bill that President Obama recently signed, on Page 562, is a provision requiring Congress to help finance and oversee the creation of a ''key national indicators'' system -- that is to say, Hoenig's State of the USA will become a national-indicators panel, run by the National Academy of Sciences. Think of it as a report card meant to show a country's citizens the exact areas -- in health, education, the environment and so forth -- where improvement is called for; such indicators would also record how we improve, or fail to improve, over time. The State of the USA intends to ultimately post around 300 indicators on issues like crime, energy, infrastructure, housing, health, education, environment and the economy. All areas of measurement will be chosen by members of the National Academy; all will be reviewed for rigor and accuracy by a panel of accomplished experts. With easy access to national information, Hoenig told me optimistically, Americans might soon be able ''to shift the debate from opinions to more evidence-based discussions to ideally a discussion about what solutions are and are not working.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those involved with the self-defined indicators movement -- people like Hoenig, as well as supporters around the world who would like to dethrone G.D.P. -- argue that achieving a sustainable economy, and a sustainable society, may prove impossible without new ways to evaluate national progress. Left unanswered, however, is the question of which indicators are the most suitable replacements for, or most suitable enhancements to, G.D.P. Should they measure educational attainment or employment? Should they account for carbon emissions or happiness? As Hoenig himself is inclined to say, and not without some enthusiasm, a new panel of national measures won't necessarily settle such arguments. On the contrary, it will have a tendency to start them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High-G.D.P. Man vs. Low-G.D.P. Man</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now at least, G.D.P. holds almost unassailable sway, not only as the key national indicator for the economic health of the United States but also for that of the rest of the world's developed countries, which employ a standardized methodology -- there's actually a handbook -- to calculate their economic outputs. And, as it happens, there are some good reasons that everyone has depended on it for so long. ''If you want to know why G.D.P. matters, you can just put yourself back in the 1930 period, where we had no idea what was happening to our economy,'' William Nordhaus, a Yale economist who has spent a distinguished career thinking about economic measurement, told me recently. ''There were people then who said things were fine and others who said things weren't fine. But we had no comprehensive measures, so we looked at things like boxcar loadings.'' If you compare the crisis of 1930 with the crisis of 2008, Nordhaus added, it has made an enormous difference to track what's happening in the economy through indexes like G.D.P. Such knowledge can enable a quick and informed policy response, which in the past year took shape as a big stimulus package, for example. To Nordhaus, in fact, the G.D.P. -- the antecedents of which were developed in the early 1930s by an economist named Simon Kuznets at the federal government's request -- is one of the greatest inventions of the 20th century. ''It's not a machine or a computer,'' he says, ''and it's not the way you usually think of an invention. But it's an awesome thing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">G.D.P. statistics are calculated a dozen times a year on the fifth floor of a modern office building on L Street in Washington, where a government economist named Steve Landefeld huddles with a group of staff members and reviews a large pile of data compiled by his agency, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, a part of the U.S. Department of Commerce. For an entire day, the suite of offices where Landefeld's group works is placed under what he calls ''lockup.'' Cellphones are handed in; land lines and Internet connections are cut off; curtains are drawn tight. Only certain personnel are allowed in and out. The men and women with Landefeld then spend the day following a process that has been refined over the past 50 years. It is a complicated affair, involving the convergence of some 10,000 streams of data that describe recent economic activity in the U.S., but the group's goal is fairly simple: to arrive at a single number and then explain it in a press release. By tradition, no one in the room says the final number aloud -- a throwback to the old days, apparently, when the fear of hidden microphones prompted silent acclamation. The finished press release is photocopied a couple of hundred times and then locked up, except for a single copy delivered at the end of the day to the chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers. Anyone who knows the figure at this point is forbidden to reveal it, lest its premature unveiling roil the global financial markets. Not until 8:30 the next morning will Landefeld's agency release the G.D.P. number to the rest of the world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government statisticians like Landefeld do not push any equivalency between an expanding G.D.P. and national progress. For them, G.D.P. is what it is and nothing more: a description of total national production that can be helpful when setting economic policy. The longtime tendency of politicians to use G.D.P. as a proxy for national well-being is not a practice the Bureau of Economic Analysis endorses or could necessarily control, even if it wanted to. That the Obama administration, for instance, has pointed to rebounding G.D.P. numbers rather than our unusually high unemployment numbers reflects a political calculation rather than a case of economists beating a drum for the glory of G.D.P.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But criticisms of G.D.P. go deeper than just its use, or misuse, by politicians. For years, economists critical of the measure have enjoyed spinning narratives to illustrate its logical flaws and limitations. Consider, for example, the lives of two people -- let's call them High-G.D.P. Man and Low-G.D.P. Man. High-G.D.P. Man has a long commute to work and drives an automobile that gets poor gas mileage, forcing him to spend a lot on fuel. The morning traffic and its stresses aren't too good for his car (which he replaces every few years) or his cardiovascular health (which he treats with expensive pharmaceuticals and medical procedures). High-G.D.P. Man works hard, spends hard. He loves going to bars and restaurants, likes his flat-screen televisions and adores his big house, which he keeps at 71 degrees year round and protects with a state-of-the-art security system. High-G.D.P. Man and his wife pay for a sitter (for their kids) and a nursing home (for their aging parents). They don't have time for housework, so they employ a full-time housekeeper. They don't have time to cook much, so they usually order in. They're too busy to take long vacations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As it happens, all those things -- cooking, cleaning, home care, three-week vacations and so forth -- are the kind of activity that keep Low-G.D.P. Man and his wife busy. High-G.D.P. Man likes his washer and dryer; Low-G.D.P. Man doesn't mind hanging his laundry on the clothesline. High-G.D.P. Man buys bags of prewashed salad at the grocery store; Low-G.D.P. Man grows vegetables in his garden. When High-G.D.P. Man wants a book, he buys it; Low-G.D.P. Man checks it out of the library. When High-G.D.P. Man wants to get in shape, he joins a gym; Low-G.D.P. Man digs out an old pair of Nikes and runs through the neighborhood. On his morning commute, High-G.D.P. Man drives past Low-G.D.P. Man, who is walking to work in wrinkled khakis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By economic measures, there's no doubt High-G.D.P. Man is superior to Low-G.D.P. Man. His salary is higher, his expenditures are greater, his economic activity is more robust. You can even say that by modern standards High-G.D.P. Man is a bigger boon to his country. What we can't really say for sure is whether his life is any better. In fact, there seem to be subtle indications that various ''goods'' that High-G.D.P. Man consumes should, as some economists put it, be characterized as ''bads.'' His alarm system at home probably isn't such a good indicator of his personal security; given all the medical tests, his health care expenditures seem to be excessive. Moreover, the pollution from the traffic jams near his home, which signals that business is good at the local gas stations and auto shops, is very likely contributing to social and environmental ills. And we don't know if High-G.D.P. Man is living beyond his means, so we can't predict his future quality of life. For all we know, he could be living on borrowed time, just like a wildly overleveraged bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">G.D.P. vs. Human Development Index</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Simon Kuznets, the inventor of so-called national accounts -- the collection of indicators calculated by the Bureau of Economic Analysis that now includes G.D.P. and a host of other economic and financial measures -- actually harbored concerns about his creation from the start. As Steve Landefeld pointed out to me, Kuznets worried that the nation's economic activity might be mistaken for its citizens' well-being. Many years later, in Kuznets's Nobel Prize lecture in 1971, he also offered a list of ways his measures might be improved. ''It seems fairly clear,'' he said then, ''that a number of analytical and measurement problems remain in the theory and in the evaluation of economic growth.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most criticisms of G.D.P. since then have tended to fall into two distinct camps. The first group maintains that G.D.P. itself needs to be fixed. High-G.D.P. Man and Low-G.D.P. Man have to become one, in effect. This might entail, for starters, placing an economic value on work done in the home, like housekeeping and child care. Activities that are currently unaccounted for, like cooking dinner at your own stove, could also be treated the same as activities that are now factored into G.D.P., like food prepared in a restaurant. Another fix might be to cease giving only positive values to events that actually detract from a country's well-being, like hurricanes and floods; both boost G.D.P. through construction costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The second group of critics, meanwhile, has sought to recast the criticism of G.D.P. from an accounting debate to a philosophical one. Here things get far more complicated. The argument goes like this: Even if G.D.P. was revised as a more modern, logical G.D.P. 2.0, our reliance on such a measure suggests that we may still be equating economic growth with progress on a planet that is possibly overburdened already by human consumption and pollution. The only way to repair such an imbalance would be to institutionalize other national indicators (environmental, say, or health-related) to reflect the true complexity of human progress. Just how many indicators are required to assess societal health -- 3? 30? 300, a la State of the USA? -- is something economists have been struggling with for years as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far only one measure has succeeded in challenging the hegemony of growth-centric thinking. This is known as the Human Development Index, which turns 20 this year. The H.D.I. is a ranking that incorporates a nation's G.D.P. and two other modifying factors: its citizens' education, based on adult literacy and school-enrollment data, and its citizens' health, based on life-expectancy statistics. The H.D.I., which happens to be used by the United Nations, has plenty of critics. For example, its three-part weightings are frequently criticized for being arbitrary; another problem is that minor variations in the literacy rates of developed nations, for example, can yield significant differences in how countries rank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One economist who helped create the Human Development Index was Amartya Sen, a Nobel laureate in economics who teaches at Harvard. When I met with Sen on a recent evening in New York, he suggested that if I wanted to place the recent arguments about G.D.P., progress and economic growth into a historical context, I should really take a minute to hear why and how the Human Development Index came together.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One day in October 1953, Sen said, he was on his way to a lecture at Cambridge University when he fell into a conversation with a student named Mahbub ul Haq. The two young men -- Sen was from India, Haq from Pakistan -- soon became friends. ''We often chatted in the evening,'' Sen recalled. ''Not so much about measurement. But we thought there was a silliness about identifying growth with development.'' Many professors at Cambridge suggested that if a country could increase its G.D.P., then all the good things would follow. ''But that seemed to both Mahbub and me to be wrong,'' Sen said. A decade later, when Sen was visiting his friend at his home in Karachi, the two would look out over the city in the evenings and talk more about the problems with G.D.P. ''Mahbub would say: 'If India and Pakistan were to grow as fast as we can possibly imagine, when you and I are 50, India and Pakistan's per capita income will only be getting close to Egypt's. Is that all we want?' '' In time, Haq began to consider measures (in health and education, mostly) that he thought could lead to policies that would make life in countries like Pakistan enormously better, even without large gains in G.D.P. This was not an argument against G.D.P., Sen emphasized to me. ''It was an argument against relying only on G.D.P.'' Many years afterward, when Haq asked Sen to help him devise the Human Development Index, Sen recoiled at the idea. ''I told Mahbub that it's vulgar to capture in one number an extremely complex story, just as G.D.P. is vulgar. And he called me back and said: 'Amartya, you're exactly right. What I want you to do is produce an index as vulgar as G.D.P. but more relevant to our own lives.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sen said he eventually came around to seeing the wisdom in Haq's pragmatism. The H.D.I. made its debut in 1990; Haq died in 1998. Sen told me he thinks the index has been extremely useful for tracking the progress of the world's poorer nations. But since he and Haq did their initial work, Sen said, the world has changed. There are much better survey data now, which allow for new types of economic and social measurement. What's more, he added, the problems associated with climate change and sustainability have become far more pressing. These were two of the reasons that, a couple of years ago, Sen joined the Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz and the French economist Jean-Paul Fitoussi on a commission established by President Nicolas Sarkozy of France to consider alternatives to G.D.P.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The third reason was that he saw an opportunity to continue the work he began with Haq, but this time with respect to the world's richer nations. ''Joe has a little bit of the pragmatism that pushed Mahbub,'' Sen said, referring to Stiglitz, who was the driving force behind the commission's work. ''You can see when push comes to shove, he'd say, 'For God's sake, let's do something that changes the world.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Stiglitz Commission and Its Dashboard</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several times last fall, I visited Stiglitz's office at Columbia University, where he is on the faculty, to talk about the shortcomings of G.D.P. Sometimes we chatted about accounting issues -- why he thinks G.D.P. creates a distorted representation of our economic lives, for instance, and how that might be remedied. In his view, Americans would have had a much clearer picture of our progress over the past decade if we had focused on median income rather than G.D.P. per capita, which is distorted by top earners and corporate profits. ''When you have increasing inequality, median and average behave differently,'' Stiglitz said. Real median household income has actually dipped since 2000. But G.D.P. per capita, he noted, has gone up. A president could go on the podium, Stiglitz said, and point to G.D.P. as proof that Americans are doing very well. But if you looked instead at median income, he said, ''you could say, a) it's not sustainable; and b) most people are actually worse off.'' We need to focus on those median figures, he insisted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most frequently in our conversations, Stiglitz gravitated to the philosophical questions of measuring progress. What are the best indicators beyond G.D.P.? How do you actually pick the most important ones? As Stiglitz recounted, Sarkozy gave the commission freedom to tear apart G.D.P. as its members saw fit. No doubt, the French president saw political advantages in the undertaking. With a more comprehensive set of indicators, a leader trying to steer a course through a faltering economy could conceivably point to successes in areas other than jobs or productivity. ''I can tell you what Sarkozy told me about what motivated him,'' Stiglitz said. ''What he said was that he felt this tension -- he is told to maximize G.D.P. but he also knows as a good politician that what people care about are things like pollution and many other dimensions to the quality of life. Those dimensions aren't well captured in G.D.P. And that puts him in a difficult position. When he comes up for election, people are going to grade him on G.D.P., but people are also going to grade on the quality of life. And so he sort of said, Can't you in some way resolve this tension by constructing measures that don't pose these dichotomies?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Stiglitz-Sen-Fitoussi Commission, as it eventually came to be known -- its official title was the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress -- grew to about two dozen members and met in Europe and the U.S. several times in 2008 and 2009. Many of the members leaned to the left, even as Sarkozy is characterized in French politics as leaning to the right. Stiglitz brought in, among others, the Princeton psychologist and Nobel laureate in economics Daniel Kahneman, as well as Enrico Giovannini, the president of the Italian National Institute of Statistics and the international economist most closely involved with the indicators movement over the past decade. In September, the commission issued a formidable report, nearly 300 pages long, that offered an exhaustive list of suggestions, some methodological and some philosophical, for measuring the progress of nations in the 21st century. ''We very quickly came to a consensus that you weren't going to get one number for a new G.D.P. number, but that it would have been nice,'' Stiglitz told me. In fact, the commission endorsed both main criticisms of the G.D.P.: the economic measure itself should be fixed to better represent individuals' circumstances today, and every country should also apply other indicators to capture what is happening economically, socially and environmentally. The commission sought a metaphor to explain what it meant. Eventually it settled on an automobile.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Suppose you're driving, Stiglitz told me. You would like to know how the vehicle is functioning, but when you check the dashboard there is only one gauge. (It's a peculiar car.) That single dial conveys one piece of important information: how fast you're moving. It's not a bad comparison to the current G.D.P., but it doesn't tell you many other things: How much fuel do you have left? How far can you go? How many miles have you gone already? So what you want is a car, or a country, with a big dashboard -- but not so big that you can't take in all of its information.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question is: How many measures beyond G.D.P. -- how many dials on a new dashboard -- will you need? Stiglitz and his fellow academics ultimately concluded that assessing a population's quality of life will require metrics from at least seven categories: health, education, environment, employment, material well-being, interpersonal connectedness and political engagement. They also decided that any nation that was serious about progress should start measuring its ''equity'' -- that is, the distribution of material wealth and other social goods -- as well as its economic and environmental sustainability. ''Too often, particularly I think in an American context, everybody says, 'We want policies that reflect our values,' but nobody says what those values are,'' Stiglitz told me. The opportunity to choose a new set of indicators, he added, is tantamount to saying that we should not only have a conversation about recasting G.D.P. We should also, in the aftermath of an extraordinary economic collapse, talk about what the goals of a society really are.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Taking the Environment Into Account</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report from the Stiglitz-Sen-Fitoussi commission isn't a blueprint, exactly -- it's more like open-source software, posted online for anyone to download, discuss and modify. It doesn't tell countries how they should measure progress. It tells them how they should think about measuring progress. One challenge here -- something that the commission's members well understood -- is that recommending new indicators and actually implementing them are very different endeavors. Almost everyone I spoke with in the indicators movement, including Chris Hoenig at State of the USA, seems to agree that at the moment our reach exceeds our grasp. When I met with Rebecca Blank, the under secretary of commerce for economic affairs, whose job it is to oversee the data agencies that put together G.D.P., she noted that new national measures depend on more than a government's willingness; they also necessitate additional financing, interagency cooperation and great leaps in the science of statistical analysis. Blank wasn't averse to some of the commission's recommendations -- indeed, she recently endorsed the idea, proposed by Steve Landefeld at the Bureau of Economic Analysis, that our national accounts add a ''household perspective'' that represents individuals' economic circumstances better than G.D.P. ''But some of the constraint is we don't have the money to do it,'' she told me, referring to various new measures. ''Some of the constraint is we know how to do it, but we need to collect additional data that we don't currently have. And some of the constraint is that we don't really know how to do it quite yet.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Environmental and sustainability indicators offer a few good examples of how big the challenge is. A relatively easy first step, several members of the Stiglitz commission told me, would be to build in a ''depletion charge'' to G.D.P. for the natural resources -- oil, gas, timber and even fisheries -- that a country transforms into dollars. At the moment, we don't do this; it's as if these commodities have no value until they are extracted and sold. A charge for resource depletion might not affect G.D.P. in the United States all that much; the country is too big and too thoroughly based on knowledge and technology industries for the depletion costs of things like coal mining and oil drilling to make much of an impact. On the other hand, in countries like Saudi Arabia and China, G.D.P. might look different (that is to say, lower) if such a charge were subtracted from their economic outputs. Geoffrey Heal, a professor at Columbia who worked on the environmental aspects of the commission's report, told me that including resource depletion in the national accounts -- something the U.S. considered in the early 1990s and then abandoned for political reasons -- could be implemented within a year if the world's developed nations agreed to do it. After that, he suggests, a next step might be to subtract from G.D.P. the cost of the health problems -- asthma and early deaths, for instance -- caused by air pollutants like sulfur dioxide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But environmental accounting gets more difficult. ''We can put monetary values on mineral stocks, fisheries and even forests, perhaps,'' Heal says. ''But it's hard to put a monetary value on alteration of the climate system, loss of species and the consequences that might come from those.'' On the other hand, Heal points out, you have to decide to measure something difficult before you can come up with a technique for measuring it. That was the case when the U.S. decided to create national accounts on economic production during the Great Depression. What the Stiglitz commission ultimately concluded was that it's necessary to make a few sustainability dials on the dashboard simply raw data -- registering things like a country's carbon footprint or species extinctions -- until we figure out how to give the effects approximate monetary values. Maybe in 10 years, Heal guesses, economists would be able to do that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To Heal, making a real and rapid effort at calculating these costs and then posting the information is imperative. According to Heal, we have no sense of how much ''natural capital'' -- our stocks of clean air and water and our various ecosystems -- we need to conserve to maintain our economy and our quality of life. ''If you push the world's natural capital below a certain level,'' Heal asks, ''do you so radically alter the system that it has a long-term impact on human welfare?'' He doesn't know the answer. Yet, he adds, if we were to pass that point -- and at present we have no dials to indicate whether we have -- then we couldn't compensate for our error through technological innovation or energy breakthroughs. Because by then it would be too late.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Putting a Number on Happiness</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As difficult as it might be to compile sustainability indicators, it's equally challenging to create measures that describe our social and emotional lives. In this area, there's a fair amount of skepticism from the academic establishment about putting happiness onto a national dashboard of well-being. William Nordhaus of Yale told me that some of the measurements are ''absurd.'' Amartya Sen, too, told me that he has reservations about the worth of statistics that purport to describe human happiness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stiglitz and his colleagues nevertheless concluded that such research was becoming sufficiently rigorous to warrant its possible inclusion. At first the connection to G.D.P. can be puzzling. One explanation, however, is that while our current economic measures can't capture the larger effects of unemployment or chronic depression, providing policy makers with that information may influence their actions. ''You might say, If we have unemployment, don't worry, we'll just compensate the person,'' Stiglitz told me. ''But that doesn't fully compensate them.'' Stiglitz pointed to the work of the Harvard professor Robert Putnam, who served on the Stiglitz-Sen-Fitoussi commission, which suggests that losing a job can have repercussions that affect a person's social connections (one main driver of human happiness, regardless of country) for many years afterward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When I caught up with Putnam, he said that the ''damage to this country's social fabric from this economic crisis must have been huge, huge, huge.'' And yet, he noted, ''We have plenty of numbers about the economic consequences but none of the numbers about the social consequences.'' Over the past decade, Putnam has been working on measures -- having to do with church attendance, community involvement and the like -- to quantify our various social links; just recently, the U.S. Census Bureau agreed to include questions of his in some of its monthly surveys. Still, his efforts are a work in progress. When I asked Putnam whether government should be in the business of fostering social connections, he replied, ''I don't think we should have a government Department of Friendship that introduces people to one another.'' But he argued that just as registering the social toll of joblessness would add a dimension of urgency to the unemployment issue, it seemed possible that measuring social connections, and putting those measures on a national dashboard, could be in society's best interests. As it happens, the Canadian Index of Well-Being will contain precisely such a measure; and it's very likely that a related measure of ''social capital,'' as it's often called, will become a State of the USA indicator too. ''People will get sick and die, because they don't know their neighbors,'' Putnam told me. ''And the health effects of social isolation are of the same magnitude as people smoking. If we can care about people smoking, because that reduces their life expectancy, then why not think about social isolation too?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It seems conceivable, in fact, that including various measures of emotional well-being on a national dashboard could lead to policies quite different from what we have now. ''There's an enormous inequality of suffering in society,'' Daniel Kahneman told me recently. By his estimate, ''if you look at the 10 percent of people who spend the most time suffering, they account for almost half of the total amount of suffering.'' Kahneman suggested that tremendous social and economic gains could therefore be made by dealing with the mental-health problems -- depression, say -- of a relatively small fraction of the population. At the same time, he added, new measures of emotional well-being that he has been working on might soon give us a more enlightened perspective on the complex relationship between money and happiness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently, research suggests that increased wealth leads us to report increased feelings of satisfaction with our lives -- a validation, in effect, that higher G.D.P. increases the well-being in a country. But Kahneman told me that his most recent studies, conducted with the Princeton economist Angus Deaton, suggest that money doesn't necessarily make much of a difference in our moment-to-moment happiness, which is distinct from our feelings of satisfaction. According to their work, income over about $70,000 does nothing to improve how much we enjoy our activities on a typical day. And that raises some intriguing questions. Do we want government to help us increase our sense of satisfaction? Or do we want it to help us get through our days without feeling misery? The two questions lead toward two very different policy options. Is national progress a matter of making an increasing number of people very rich? Or is it about getting as many people as possible into the middle class?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Political Resistance</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past few months, the recommendations of the Stiglitz-Sen-Fitoussi commission have been taken up for debate by the European Union's statistical office as well as by the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which serves as a kind of policy forum for the world's developed countries. To Stiglitz and his colleagues, an ideal outcome would be a consensus by these international agencies -- and, in turn, the world's governments -- to start measuring progress through a dashboard with a dozen or so dials, moving the focus away from G.D.P. and onto other aspects of the economy, society and environment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When I spoke with Enrico Giovannini, the head of Italy's national statistics agency, he said, ''The good news, I think, is that at the international level there are signs that something is changing.'' Giovannini then ticked off a list of a half-dozen countries -- including Germany, the United Kingdom and France -- where top officials have aligned themselves with an expanded focus on ''well-being'' rather than growth as a measure of progress. At the same time, he noted, the Human Development Index is planning its own revision later this year, a project with which Giovannini is involved. And the H.D.I. planners, Giovannini said, were considering other progress indicators that have been recommended by the Stiglitz commission.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the effects of such changes, Stiglitz told me, ''What we measure affects what we do, and better measurement will lead to better decisions, or at least different decisions.'' But until the developed nations of the world actually move beyond G.D.P. -- a big if -- this remains a reasoned hypothesis only. A lingering question is whether some government officials, perceiving dangers in a new measurement system, might conclude that such an overhaul would wreak political havoc and therefore ought to be avoided. A heightened focus on environmental indicators, for starters, could give environmental legislation a far greater urgency. And a revision of economic measures presents other potential policy complications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has long been the case, for example, that the G.D.P. of the United States outpaces that of European countries with higher taxes and greater government spending; it has thus seemed reasonable to view our economic growth as a vindication of a national emphasis on free markets and entrepreneurship. But things look different if you see the measure itself as flawed or inadequate. We take shorter vacations than Europeans, for instance, which is one reason their G.D.P. is lower than ours -- but that could change if our indicators start putting a value on leisure time. Some of the disparity, meanwhile, between the U.S. and various European countries, Stiglitz argued, is a statistical bias resulting from the way G.D.P. formulas account for public-sector benefits. In other words, the services received from the government in a country like Sweden -- in public education, health care and child care, among other things -- are likely undervalued. Rejiggering the measures of prosperity would almost certainly challenge our self-perceptions, Stiglitz said, perhaps so much so that in the U.S. we might begin to ask, Is our system working as well for most people as we think it has been?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">State of the USA has its own political hurdles to overcome: until Congressional leaders appoint a bipartisan commission for the administration of the Key National Indicators System (something they're required to do promptly, according to the new health care legislation but had not done by early May), the indicators system, and to some extent State of the USA, are in limbo. All the same, a huge system of measurement like State of the USA may be more politically palatable to America's elected officials than the smaller dashboard envisioned by the Stiglitz commission. For one thing, it makes the definition of progress more diffuse. If hundreds of measures -- economic, environmental, educational and the like -- are thrown into the mix, users can pick and choose their markers of progress. And argue about them. Now, this might push us into a situation akin to what Simon Kuznets found himself in when he was formulating ways to measure the national economy -- confronting all sorts of data but no real coherence. But that's not how Hoenig -- or Stiglitz, for that matter -- sees it. ''The whole idea here, in how it relates to Stiglitz's report, is that this is a dashboard, with real data, that's going to be live, now, on real issues,'' Hoenig told me. His view is that the project will make the U.S. the first country in the world whose population enjoys what he called ''a shared, quantitative frame of reference.'' The size of the indicators panel is not a stumbling block; if anything, he argued, it's an asset for an information-based society. The G.D.P. and other indexes, Hoenig said, are ''an artifact of a world before the Web.'' For his part, Stiglitz sees the State of the USA as a complement to any future dashboard system. A small dashboard of indicators could be useful for some purposes, a large panel for others. ''When you go to a good doctor today, they don't just look at one or two vital signs,'' he said. ''They look at a hundred statistics.'' State of the USA, he told me, could be a ''rich diagnostic tool'' for evaluating the health of the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's worth noting, in any event, that despite its size, State of the USA is not kludgy. When Hoenig showed me the site recently -- most of it remains password-protected until its anticipated summer unveiling -- it was simple, with a click of a tab, to see how the U.S. measured up in various ways, from health-insurance coverage to obesity, on a state-by-state basis. It was fairly evident that the site could actually fulfill one of the legislative demands of the national-indicators system, which is to allow Americans to track how (or whether) our new health care legislation changes our health care costs and perhaps our health. It was likewise possible to imagine that if new measures of happiness, say, or environmental sustainability eventually pass statistical muster, they, too, could find places as State of the USA indicators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clicking around his site with me, Hoenig paused to say: ''Right now, we actually don't know where this country is going. But this is an opportunity to grasp that.'' And then he kept on clicking.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The publishing giant Conde Nast has been talking to the <span class="companylink">Port Authority of New York and New Jersey</span> about moving to 1 World Trade Center when it is completed, a potential coup for the signature skyscraper rising at ground zero.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to real estate executives who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks were secret, the publisher would take up as much as one million square feet in what is planned to be the country's tallest office tower, a symbolic 1,776 feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, the only tenants are government offices and a Chinese real estate company. Conde Nast, which established Times Square as a hip and resurgent area when it moved into 4 Times Square in 1999, would be an entirely different matter, bringing its particular cachet downtown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's the perfect place for them,'' said Elizabeth H. Berger, president of the Alliance for Downtown New York. ''The lunch crowd will be very well dressed. And where else can you go to Tiffany and Century 21 on your lunch hour?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Lower Manhattan is increasingly a place where progressive, interesting companies want to be,'' she added. ''They'd do for us what Conde Nast did for Times Square when they built their current building.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conde Nast would not confirm any of the trade center plans on Thursday. When contacted, the company's longtime spokeswoman, Maurie Perl, said, ''At this time we've got nothing to say.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stephen Sigmund, a spokesman for the Port Authority, declined to comment ''on any potential discussions.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conde Nast, which publishes Vanity Fair, Vogue, W, The New Yorker, Architectural Digest and 13 other consumer magazines, is not the only company considering the tower. <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> and two other financial firms have inquired about 1 World Trade Center, formerly known as the Freedom Tower, according to real estate executives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, nothing is certain. Conde Nast, which occupies about 800,000 square feet at 4 Times Square, as well as five other buildings across Manhattan, has been looking for a new home for some time. In 2007, the company was part of a bid for the development rights over the West Side railyards by the developer Douglas Durst, whose family owns 4 Times Square.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Companies considering moves or consolidation routinely scour the entire market, visiting every place big enough to accommodate them. Sometimes they move, and other times they use the alternative as a cudgel to get a better deal from their current landlord.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if Conde Nast or a major financial company moved to 1 World Trade, it would be a step forward for a building once derided as an ill-advised boondoggle. Several developers recently submitted bids to buy a minority stake in the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A deal with Conde Nast for one million square feet would go a long way toward filling up the 2.9-million-square-foot tower. The state and federal governments have promised to rent about 1.2 million square feet, and Vantone, the Chinese company, has signed a lease for 190,000 square feet. The Port Authority could hold the remaining 500,000 square feet at the top of the skyscraper for a tenant willing to pay the highest rent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there are other options downtown, where brokers expect the vacancy rate to rise in the next two years. The developer Larry A. Silverstein is looking for tenants for two towers he plans to build at the trade center. The old <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> headquarters downtown is also available, and <span class="companylink">Brookfield Properties</span> has a lot of space available at the World Financial Center.</p>

</div><div class="author">By CASEY B. MULLIGAN   </div><div>1380 words</div><div>12 May 2010</div><div>NYT Blogs</div><div>NYTB</div><div>English</div><div>© 2010 The New York Times Company. All rights reserved   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Casey B. Mulligan is an economics professor at the University of Chicago.Several factors regarding housing supply and demand have changed since the turn of the century and will change in the years to come, in the direction of increasing the nation's housing inventories. As a result, at least part of the construction boom of the last 10 years served a legitimate economic purpose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Motivated in large part by extraordinarily high housing prices, the nation's home builders were busy building and renovating from 2000 to 2006. As a result, the housing inventory at the end of the housing boom was 3 or 4 percent above the trends of the previous decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One perspective says that most of the housing boom was a colossal market mistake: an unfortunate consequence of easy money, lax regulator oversight, subsidies to home ownership and irrationally exuberant&nbsp; buyers.&nbsp; In this view, public policy would ideally have pushed back, and housing construction would not have boomed anywhere close to the way it did. Let's call this the "bubble theory."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The opposing view says that there were good supply and demand reasons to significantly increase the amount of housing above previous trends. With the advantage of hindsight, we might have preferred to have stretched out the 2000-2006 construction activity over a longer period, or to have put some of the new houses in different locations. Still much of the housing built in the 2000s will ultimately prove desirable. Let's call this the "fundamentals theory."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The various supply and demand forces can be distinguished according to whether they affect the amount of rent paid by a home's occupants, or whether they affect the fraction of the rent that a landlord and his creditors can keep as a return on their capital investment.&nbsp; (For the sake of exposition, my discussion treats the landlord and tenant as distinct, even though with owner-occupied dwellings they are the same.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pie chart below shows the distribution of tenants' rental payments to various uses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The largest piece of the pie - "cash flow to owners and creditors" - is the amount going to the owner of the home or apartment, and his creditors, that serves as a return on&nbsp; investment.&nbsp; It includes the principal and interest paid on mortgages, and any surplus the owners may have after making a mortgage payment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other pieces include property taxes, payments to employees who manage and repair the property, and payments for intermediate inputs such as real estate agents and mortgage industry employees. (This last piece does not include principal and interest paid on mortgages, but would include the mortgage closing costs that finance the salaries of industry employees).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The "cash flow" piece is an important determinant of housing prices, because the "fundamentals theory" says that homes sell for the present value of the cash flow.&nbsp; The cash flow to owners, and therefore housing prices, would increase if rents increased, so that the total pie expanded.&nbsp; But the owners would also get more, and homes would be worth more, if owners could pay less to real estate agents, property managers, and mortgage brokers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In other words, housing prices can also go up because the entire pie is expected to increase in size, or because the cash flow piece is expected to get larger while some of the other pieces get smaller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An extraordinary population growth rate would be good reason to build houses at a faster pace and would cause prices of housing to increase for occupants.&nbsp; Yet the human population of the United States grew at about the same rate 1995-2005 that it did 1980-95 (about 1 percent per year during both periods, although the total pounds of humans have probably grown more in the recent period).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But let's not forget about the non-humans in our homes - the stuff!</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumer durable statistics from the Bureau of Economic Analysis confirm the obvious: From 1995 to 2005, ownership of furnishings and appliances increased at a rate of 4.5 percent per person per year (as compared to 2.2 percent in the earlier period), and ownership of recreational goods rose 9.1 percent per person per year (as compared with 5.4 percent earlier).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In case you still doubt that Americans have genuinely increased their demand for space, note that the self-storage industry has more than doubled its share of the national economy since 1995, according to employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another way to distinguish supply and demand forces is whether they have their effects on owner net cash flows before 2005, or were expected to affect those flows after 2005.&nbsp; To the extent that houses were more valuable during the boom because of favorable cash flows - perhaps because home occupants had a high demand for space to keep their stuff - rents probably would have risen faster than home prices, because home prices are a kind of average of current and future cash flows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, inflation-adjusted housing rents did increase in the late 1990s and early 2000s, but much less than home prices did.&nbsp; This is why I, and several other economists, have concluded that the majority of the housing boom derived from market expectations about the future, rather than something that happened to housing demand before 2006 (this same logic says that home prices were only moderately stimulated by the fact that mortgage rates were lower in the 2000s than they were in the 1990s: see these items from Professor Paul Krugman and me for more on that point).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Undoubtedly, Americans will continue to accumulate stuff, and will have commensurate increases in their housing demand, which could partly explain why housing prices increased more than housing rents during the boom.&nbsp; But the accumulation of stuff by itself would be unlikely to produce the housing bust we saw after 2006 because our furniture, clothing, toys, etc., did not suddenly disappear in 2007, but housing prices came crashing down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That brings me to a second set of housing market factors that reinforce the increased demand for space: anticipated advances in information technology.&nbsp; Information technology will likely reduce home ownership costs - shrink the "real estate, mortgage industry employees, and other intermediate inputs" and "compensation of employees" pieces of the pie - but for now we cannot be sure exactly when and how much.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House shopping began an ongoing transformation over the past several years, with shoppers able to take spectacular virtual tours of properties.&nbsp; Arguably information technology will someday enable most home shoppers to do without a human real estate agent, and this would be a significant cost savings for home sellers.&nbsp; Don't forget that a home is built once but typically sold many times, with each sale creating a fee for real estate agents, and many of the sales involving a vacancy period during which no one gets value from the structure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Market participants might have also hoped that mortgage loan screening could improve, and become less labor intensive, thanks to information technology.&nbsp; The economists Robert Hall and Susan Woodward pointed out in 2008 that "Recent years have seen great improvements in data, especially the introduction of credit scores, which gave lenders new powers to forecast mortgage defaults and to adjust interest rates offered to prospective borrowers. In 1990, credit scores were rare; by 1996, they were standard."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of these things are expected to someday significantly reduce the costs of owning a home, managing it and keeping it occupied.&nbsp; But it will be years until we know exactly when and how much; in the meantime, the housing market may gyrate as it adapts to these historically rare, but ultimately beneficial, changes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing bubble-theorists have not yet seriously considered factors like these.&nbsp; Until they have, it is too early to blame a majority of the housing boom on irrationally exuberant home buyers, because even without these things a historically unusual housing boom may well have been efficient.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A prominent law firm is expected to sign a lease next week for a new home in the vacant 40-story tower called 11 Times Square, ending months of speculation about the deal and providing another sign that the commercial real estate market may have hit bottom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The developer of the 1.1-million-square-foot glass tower, which is nearing completion at the southeast corner of 42nd Street and Eighth Avenue, is also negotiating with several companies who want to build an aquarium filled with sharks, rays and penguins on the lower floors of the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It remains unclear whether those companies can raise the estimated $100 million needed for such a tourist attraction. But real estate executives who have been briefed on the deal with the law firm, Proskauer Rose, said that it was finally ready to commit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Proskauer plans to lease about 380,000 square feet, or roughly 40 percent, of the $1.2 billion tower, which has until now stood as a symbol of the tattered financial and real estate markets, said the executives, who requested anonymity because the deal had not been signed. Proskauer's name would be displayed at the entrance to the tower, and possibly at the top.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a really positive sign for New York,'' said Joseph R. Harbert, chief operating officer of Cushman &amp;Wakefield New York, a real estate broker. ''It's a new building, and it's Times Square.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both Proskauer and the developer, Steven J. Pozycki, chief executive of SJP Properties, declined to comment through spokesmen. <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>, the real estate broker representing both parties, also declined to discuss the pending deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate executives said that the lease could be signed as early as Wednesday. Still, they cautioned against any exuberance about a sudden turnaround in the market over all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Proskauer deal is being propelled by what is in effect a subsidy worth tens of millions of dollars from <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>, the giant bank that is Proskauer's current landlord at 1585 Broadway, between 47th and 48th Streets, which is also <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>'s world headquarters. <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> has from time to time offered Proskauer millions of dollars to vacate the 12 floors it occupies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Proskauer is using the undisclosed sum from <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> to offset the cost of moving seven blocks to 42nd Street and Eighth Avenue and building new offices in the unfinished space it is getting. SJP Properties is also offering substantial concessions. Other tenants would probably not be able to reap the same benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter G. Riguardi, president of the real estate company <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>'s New York region, said he was ''cautiously optimistic'' about the state of the Manhattan commercial market. The Proskauer deal, he said, would be symbolically important, but it would probably not result in a net reduction of vacant space, since <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> will move employees to its headquarters from nearby buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The deal would, however, remove one of the few large blocks of vacant space from the Midtown market, which brokers said could eventually lead to an increase in rents. <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span>'s move to expand at 1585 Broadway is another good sign.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate executives and the Bloomberg administration have been anxiously scanning the Manhattan skyline for signs that the market has rebounded. After the financial industry collapsed in 2008, commercial rents and values plunged by as much as 40 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rents are still falling, albeit at a slower pace, and most real estate brokers say that Manhattan is still mostly a ''renter's market.'' But, they added, there are signs of life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Companies that had hesitated to make a move last year are starting to sign long-term leases. Indeed, Avon, Hachette Filipacchi Media and six other companies signed leasing deals in the first quarter of this year for over 100,000 square feet of space each. The pool of surplus office space offered by corporate tenants is also shrinking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's another major relocation deal getting signed this year,'' said Mitchell Stier, chairman of Studley, a real estate broker. ''There were very few in 2009.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Proskauer almost reached a deal at another planned tower on Eighth Avenue at the top of the market in 2008, when <span class="companylink">Morgan Stanley</span> offered it about $100 million to move, according to two brokers. But the deal collapsed. Now the bank is offering substantially less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers say that Proskauer will pay about $75 a square foot for floors in the middle of the tower on 42nd Street, about 30 percent less than what the developer had hoped to get in 2008. The developer could still charge higher rents for the top floors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pending deal would be a relief for both the developer and his financial partner, <span class="companylink">Prudential Real Estate</span> Investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Obviously, the market is completely different than when we put the first shovel in the ground three years ago,'' said Kevin Smith, a portfolio manager for Prudential. ''We had a great recession. The rent economics are not nearly as positive as when we started, but we're confident about the long-term value of this property.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A revival in global trade has spurred the first speculative warehouse development at Kennedy International Airport in almost a decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The industrial market around Kennedy Airport -- where tenants tend to be freight-forwarding businesses, trucking companies, United States Customs brokers, and other airline or aviation-related service businesses -- is one of the most robust in the world, according to the CoStar Group, a real estate information company in Bethesda, Md.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the area has virtually no land available to develop, inventory rarely grows and vacancy rates tend to hover at around 5 percent, while prices to lease space or buy it are among the highest in the nation's industrial markets, including its airports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in 2008 and 2009, the vacancy rate still crept only as high as 10 percent. Vacancy rates at other American airports that handle large amounts of cargo, like those in Atlanta, Dallas-Fort Worth and Chicago, tend to hover around 10 percent or higher even in good economic times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Though global trade flows are down, it's almost impossible to build new space'' at Kennedy, said Hans Nordby, a director of advisory services at CoStar, ''and people who ship air freight are fairly price-insensitive, because they just have to be there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The airport's air cargo volumes, particularly international ones, have been growing rapidly since November 2009, and airport officials and developers are preparing for an upswing in global trade over the next few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vista Realty Partners, a real estate development firm in Manhattan, will break ground in September on an air cargo warehouse, possibly with offices, of up to 110,000 square feet on five acres on Eastern Road, on the northern edge of the airport.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The last warehouse to be built near Kennedy was the four-building AMB JFK Logistics Center, which was begun in 2001 on Rockaway Boulevard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To build even the most generic of warehouses, construction costs would be about $125 to $150 a square foot, said Marc Esrig, a principal with Vista. While Vista's principals would prefer to build for a specific tenant, they are comfortable enough with the reviving market to forge ahead without one, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asking rents in the Kennedy Airport industrial market are about $13 to $14 a square foot, according to the Greater Jamaica Development Corporation. ''It's a tremendous investment to build a building and not have a tenant to take the risk,'' Mr. Esrig said, ''but we're sensing that this economic freeze is starting to thaw.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While New York City owns all the property inside the airport, which is leased to and run by the <span class="companylink">Port Authority of New York and New Jersey</span>, the largest property owner off the airport grounds is AMB Property, a real estate investment trust based in San Francisco that specializes in distribution facilities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AMB owns about 1.5 million square feet of the six million-square-foot market surrounding Kennedy Airport, said Reid Berch, a senior director and partner at Corporate National Realty, a commercial brokerage, whose client is AMB.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In 2010, we've seen a steady, slow, positive increase in activity and leasing,'' Mr. Berch said. ''And the occupancy is increasing as well, so the market's looking stronger.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides those properties owned by AMB, other ownership consists of a few private companies, institutional owners and some local families. The second largest owner is Seagis Property Group of West Conshohocken, Pa., one of the leading owners of industrial real estate in the eastern United States, which owns 500,000 square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a pretty unique market to own property in,'' said Charles Lee, a principal at Seagis, ''because you've got what is in the neighborhood of the seventh-largest international cargo airport in terms of volume, but you have a pretty finite universe of buildings for that cargo to go into.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The additional 110,000 square feet of space coming with the Vista Management project, which will provide the only modern facilities other than the JFK Logistics Center, will have little effect on rents at existing warehouses, he said. ''Clearly new supply always dampens leasing velocity for a period of time, but 110,000 square feet isn't going to give anybody any broad concern for that marketplace over time,'' Mr. Lee said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to the Vista project, the Port Authority said on April 29 that it would begin demolishing six obsolete cargo buildings and five underutilized hangars on the airport to expand its cargo and passenger businesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The $42.3 million program will free up about 109 acres for development of locations for future cargo growth, among other functions, said Michael J. Bednarz, the Port Authority's air cargo business manager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Right now, we are O.K. in terms of warehouse capacity versus the amount of cargo; however, we are in a growth pattern again,'' he said. For the months of November through March, international and domestic cargo volume grew almost 20 percent from the same month a year earlier.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are in a decent growth pattern, and we expect this return to growth to stay consistent,'' Mr. Bednarz said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buildings and hangars are no longer used because many airlines are divesting their real estate and transferring cargo-handling duties to third-party operators. Kennedy Airport will be redeveloping some of the demolished buildings and hangars to consolidate them into a sort of ''cargo campus,'' said Susan M. Baer, aviation director for the Port Authority.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Airlines are interested in focusing on their core business -- flying airplanes and people -- and want to have others handle cargo for them,'' Ms. Baer said. ''And it can be done more efficiently for them by a third party, without having to have these long fixed leases and big structures to maintain themselves.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan is to request development proposals for the cargo campus from private developers in about a year, she said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is it better to rent or to own?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The default answer for a long time -- when real estate's horizon seemed limitless -- was to own. Lately some individuals and businesses have decided that maybe owning is not always better, especially when you have other pressing needs for cash, like paying off your creditors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now the idea has spread to some states with serious debt problems. In January the state of Arizona concluded a deal to sell to investors ownership stakes worth a total of $735 million in several state-owned office buildings, arenas and other properties -- including the buildings housing both chambers of the State Legislature. Arizona will lease back the property from its new landlords, among them the mutual fund giants Fidelity and Vanguard, for 20 years, after which ownership will revert to the state. Arizona is planning another, smaller round of real estate sales in June. For fiscal 2011, which begins in July, the state is estimated to have a deficit of $3 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although it has been drowned out by hotter issues, like the uproar over the state's new immigration law, some Arizona politicians have sought to make an issue of the sale-leaseback. Dean Martin, the state's treasurer and a candidate for the Republican nomination for governor this fall, has derided the sale as a one-time gimmick used to circumvent the state's debt limit and avoid the hard choices he contends Arizona needs to make about what he calls ''unsupportable spending.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''How many times can you sell the state capital?'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Martin said he wanted to repackage the state's debt as bonds and use some of the proceeds to buy back the buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Who wants to make a long-term investment in a state that is renting its Capitol buildings?'' he has been asking on the campaign trail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last month California received sale-leaseback bids on a portfolio of 7.3 million square feet of office space in 11 state-owned buildings. The Golden State Portfolio includes buildings in Los Angeles and Sacramento, as well as the San Francisco Civic Center, where the state Supreme Court sits. The deal had been expected to yield about $660 million in revenue for the state, after $1.1 billion in expected proceeds were used to pay off construction bonds. California's deficit for 2010-11 is about $20 billion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kevin Shannon, a vice chairman of the commercial real estate firm <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>, which is managing the auction for the state, said he believed the state would take in more than expected once it analyzed the bids and completed a deal, which is expected to happen by the middle of May. Mr. Shannon said the auction had produced more than 300 bids.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's been a lot of press about this being a fire sale,'' he said, ''but we're in a competitive bidding situation.'' Mr. Shannon said demand for the properties had been greater than expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As with Arizona's leaseback, the California auction has become a political football. The state Legislature was almost unanimous in approving the plan a year ago. More recently, however, two members of state real estate boards whose approval was necessary for the sale to proceed say they were abruptly dismissed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger because they opposed the deal. They have told reporters they believe it would cost the state more in rent money than it would raise. A state Assembly committee is reviewing the matter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The view that the deal does not make economic sense has been seconded by others, including the state's independent Legislative Analyst's Office, which has called the sale ''bad budgeting practice.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The leaseback continues to enjoy the support of the governor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The governor doesn't believe the state should be in the real estate business,'' said Erin Shaw, a spokeswoman for the California Department of General Services, which manages the state's property holdings. Governor Schwarzenegger said recently that he would not approve a sale if bids were too low. Previously the state shelved a proposed sale of the Orange County fairgrounds when bids came in lower than expected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides Arizona and California, only Connecticut is conducting a sale of state office buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Connecticut, however, is seeking bids for straight-out purchases of buildings it regards as surplus rather than sale-leasebacks. The comparatively modest properties, which include the Litchfield Jail and the Bristol Armory, have attracted little attention.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gordon F. DuGan, chief executive of W. P. Carey and Company, a real estate investment company that specializes in corporate sale-leaseback deals, said that if the California sale went well other states might follow. Mr. DuGan said, however, that he had not heard of any great interest in such future deals from either prospective buyers or sellers. W. P. Carey has made a bid for some of the California properties, which Mr. DuGan does not expect will be accepted. (The state has said it prefers bidders for the entire package.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. DuGan said bidding for the California property appeared stronger than he had expected, particularly considering that, unlike other sale-leasebacks, the California deal requires buyers to pick up the cost of services like waste hauling and security. He said that structure made the deal more appealing to bidders that, unlike his company, had big operations units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The risk of drawing unwanted headlines by selling state property may be one reason the idea has yet to take hold in other states that are short on money. A few years ago a spurt in the sale of state- and city-owned infrastructure, like highways and bridges, ended amid outrage that some of these properties were being sold to foreign investors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another reason for the absence of a rush to such deals may be relatively modest proceeds for states. Dan Fasulo, chief of research at <span class="companylink">Real Capital Analytics</span>, which tracks commercial real estate markets, said in an e-mail message, ''There are many states that look at things like this during a crisis, but at the end of the day the amount of money raised from such activities is a laughable amount when viewed from the context of the overall budget shortfalls.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Uwe E. Reinhardt is an economics professor at Princeton.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've lost almost $11 trillion of household wealth in the last 17 or 18 months," lamented Senator Christopher J. Dodd, the Connecticut Democrat, on last Sunday's "Meet the Press," as he urged Congress to proceed with speedy deliberations on a finance reform bill.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eleven trillion dollars! That's over three-quarters of our current gross domestic product.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where did all this wealth go? Did other folks get it? Or did it just go up in smoke?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For that matter, what precisely is "wealth"? Is it something tangible we can see, or is it something intangible - something merely imagined?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an illuminating paper on asset values and wealth, the economist Michael Reiter defined wealth in a way that makes sense to economists:"Wealth" is the present value of the expected stream of future utility [human happiness] that an "infinitely lived individual or a dynasty" [or a nation] could hope to extract from the real resources available now and in the indefinite future, assuming these real resources are allocated and managed now, and over time, so as to maximize that present value of future utils (at the "proper" discount rate).Two practical points can be extracted from this abstract definition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, economists think of wealth not just in monetary terms -- as cash, stocks, bonds and real estate -- but in terms of human well-being.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Second, and most importantly, the wealth a nation believes itself to possess is based strictly on the citizenry's expectations about the future. It is in good part a figment of the citizens' imagination.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be sure, these imaginations are anchored in the tangible and intangible resources a nation has at any moment and hopes to have in the future. Among these resources are patents and blueprints that represent the current technological state of the art.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the same set of current resources can trigger vastly different levels of imagined "wealth," depending on the citizens' mood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To illustrate that these are not just the abstract musings of an econ-geek, let us look at the value of something concrete: a building. Here I draw on a tongue-in-cheek paper I once penned for Princeton alumni entitled "How Much is a Building Worth?"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What could be more real and concrete than a building?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Imagine, then, a new building that, fully leased at current rental rates, currently yields the owner $20 million in cash per year, after all of the owner's expenses of operating and maintaining the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Assume the building will be in operation for 40 years, after which it will be torn down at costs that are just covered by selling the land underneath it. That assumption allows us to view the current value of the building to its owner, or to a prospective buyer, as the time-value adjusted sum of the annual net cash flows accruing to the owner(s) over the next 40 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The term "time-value adjusted" refers to the idea that, say, $1,000 receivable one year hence is worth less to the recipient than it is now, because something less than $1,000 could be invested today at some interest rate to grow to $1,000 a year hence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the relevant interest rate were 5 percent, then $952.31 would do the trick. It would grow to $1,000 in one year. The "present value of $1,000 receivable one year hence at a discount rate of 5 percent" therefore is $952.31. By similar logic, and assuming one could earn a compound-interest rate of 5 percent on money invested for 20 years now, $1,000 receivable, say, 10 years from now has a present value of only $376.89, and so on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The graph below shows the present value of our building at different discount rates and for three assumed annual growth rates in the annual cash flow from the building. The exercise clearly shows just how sensitive the value of long-lived assets, such as an office tower, is to assumptions about the future. It can explain why Hong Kong real estate values literally fell by half as part of the Asian financial meltdown of 1997.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discount rate used in this exercise should be thought of as the rate of return that a prospective buyer of the building would expect minimally to earn on that investment to find the deal attractive. That rate is driven by three key factors: (1) what one could earn on a risk-free investment, e.g., a United States Treasury Inflation Protected Security (also known as TIPs), (2) the investor's expectations about future annual inflation rates, and (3) a risk premium to compensate the investor for the perceived uncertainty inherent in investing in long-lived assets such as real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is here that mood enters the picture.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If investors are exuberantly optimistic about the future growth of the economy and future rental rates, and if they believe there is little risk in such long-term investments, the risk premiums they demand tend to be low and real estate values correspondingly high. Completely irrational exuberance of the sort we have seen in recent years can easily lead to serious "underpricing of risk" and, thus, to real estate bubbles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the other hand, if investors are very pessimistic and worried about the risk inherent in such investments, their risk premiums rise and asset values fall. Irrational despondency can lead to overpricing risk and underpricing real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, what is true for real estate also applies to other assets -- home values, stock prices, bond prices and so on.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So let's go back to the lost $11 trillion in wealth lamented by Senator Dodd. Where did it go? For the most part, I suspect, it just went up in smoke. It represents a loss of wealth that once exuberant folks imagined to have had and now imagine they no longer have.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">True, with its clever but untoward shenanigans, Wall Street has sucked billions of dollars out of the pockets of hard-working folks on Main Street and transferred them into the financiers' own pockets. In this connection, merely read these articles to see how it was done.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But they didn't amass $11 trillion. The bankers did not get that rich.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The New York attorney general's office is taking a close look at plans to convert the Apthorp apartment building, one of the city's best known, into luxury condominiums, an assemblywoman confirmed on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo, must sign off on all co-op and condominium conversions, but Assemblywoman Linda B. Rosenthal, along with officials briefed on the review, said that Mr. Cuomo's office was conducting an unusually detailed review of the Apthorp, a 165-unit building -- a city landmark -- that occupies an entire block anchored at Broadway and West 79th Street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was not clear, however, whether the inquiry was a sign of potential problems with the conversion or merely an indication of the building's high profile -- a number of celebrities, including Al Pacino and Rosie O'Donnell, have called it home -- and its highly mobilized tenants' association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To move forward with a condominium project, developers typically have to sell 15 percent of a building's available for-sale units. The developer at the Apthorp, Apthorp Associates, said it had met that threshold, but the attorney general's office has been interviewing would-be buyers to make sure they are legitimate purchasers who plan to live in the apartments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The attorney general's office also has been speaking with tenants and local politicians about complaints about renovations. On April 23, members of the office spent several hours walking through the building and reviewing the work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is the attorney general's responsibility to approve condo conversion plans, but he went beyond the normal practice,'' said Ms. Rosenthal, whose office has been fielding complaints from tenants. ''I'm very pleased the attorney general has taken a particular interest in this building because we have to protect the health and safety of residents.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard Bamberger, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, dismissed claims that its research was unusual. Mr. Bamberger called it ''part of our standard process.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stuart Saft, a lawyer for Apthorp Associates, said it had provided the attorney general with all the documents it had sought. ''We expect that as soon as we complete the review, that they will be able to proceed with the closings,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Rosenthal said that before the building was sold in 2007 for $426 million, it was largely self-sufficient, and that her office rarely heard from renters. But since the latest owners embarked on their plans to turn the building into luxury condominiums, she said, her office has been in ''constant communication'' with the remaining renters, some who pay market rates and some whose apartments are rent-stabilized and who cannot be forced to move. All the complaints have been about renovations going on outside the tenants' doors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Rosenthal, along with State Senator Thomas K. Duane and Gale A. Brewer, a city councilwoman from the Upper West Side, started contacting government agencies and the developer about the building's conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year, representatives from the Fire Department, the Department of Buildings, the Department of Housing Preservation and Development and the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene inspected the building and identified nearly 30 violations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andrew Ratner, vice president of Broadwall Management, the building's manager, responded in an April 14 letter to the elected officials that his office was addressing the problems, which included blocked exits, exposed wiring and construction dust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These problems are just another step in a long drama since the 102-year-old building, built by the Astor family, was sold during the height of the real estate boom. After the sale, the owners fought among themselves so bitterly that they could not agree on a type of arbitration. These battles nearly drove the property into foreclosure in 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, there seems to be interest among buyers seeking to live at the same address Nora Ephron and Cyndi Lauper once had. According to the Web site StreetEasy.com, the building has 30 units in contract that were originally listed for sale at $895,000 to $21.1 million and 15 unsold apartments that cost $3.1 million to $12.2 million.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article in some copies on Thursday about the scrutiny by the New York attorney general's office of plans to convert the Apthorp apartment building into luxury condominiums misstated the age of the building. It is 102 years old, not 108.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing prices recorded their first annual increase in more than three years in February, but there was little cause for celebration as the monthly number again showed a decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span> Case-Shiller Home Price Index, a widely watched indicator, was up 0.6 percent in February from February 2009, data released Tuesday show. The last time the index showed an annual increase was in December 2006, just as prices were beginning their long slide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The current trend is once again down, however, with last year's strong summer and fall yielding to a weak winter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prices dropped 0.9 percent in February from the previous month. It was the fifth consecutive monthly decline and the largest since last March when measured in numbers not adjusted for seasonal variations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">S.&amp;P. announced last week that the unadjusted numbers were a more reliable indicator than its seasonally adjusted numbers, a break with the company's past preference for treating both data sets equally. In recent months, the two indexes have diverged, with the adjusted numbers showing the market was modestly improving and the unadjusted numbers showing it was modestly declining.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In explaining its new preference for the unadjusted numbers, the Case-Shiller Home Price Index Committee said that the housing market crash had generated ''unusual movements that are easily mistaken for shifts in the normal seasonal patterns.'' These movements, which include an abundance of foreclosures, have resulted in ''misleading results,'' the committee said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Karl E. Case, a member of the committee and the co-developer of the index, said, ''The thing that spooked us is that the seasonal component got bigger. We found ourselves with this number we didn't quite understand.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The best way to measure the strength of housing, the committee now says, is on an annual basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By that measure, housing was barely holding its own in the year ending in February. Eleven of the 20 cities declined during the period. Las Vegas performed the worst, dropping 14.6 percent, followed by Tampa, Seattle and Detroit. The best performer was San Francisco, up 11.9 percent, followed by San Diego and Los Angeles. New York City was down 4.1 percent for the year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The health of the housing market is difficult to determine. The government has poured more than a trillion dollars of stimulus into real estate, but that support is now beginning to taper off. A tax credit for buyers expires this week. That stimulated sales in March and this month, and probably helped prices as well. But it is likely to weaken the market this summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the credit had any effect on prices this winter, it was minimal. Nineteen of the 20 cities in the index, excepting only San Diego, fell in February from January on an unadjusted basis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other housing indexes mirror the weak Case-Shiller numbers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government's housing price index, released last week, fell 0.2 percent in February on an adjusted basis to a new low for this cycle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Compiled by the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span>, the index uses data from mortgages that have been sold to or guaranteed by the government-controlled mortgage holding companies, <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>. It tends to be less volatile than other indexes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another index, compiled by First American CoreLogic, dropped 2 percent in February from January. That drop followed a 1.6 percent decline from December to January.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The First American index is not seasonally adjusted, which probably means that the traditionally weak winter market may be pushing the numbers down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First American projected this week that house prices would decline 3 to 4 percent over the next year, assuming there is not yet another round of stimulus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The administration has made a policy of putting a floor under home prices, and they succeeded,'' a First American analyst, Sam Khater, said. Over the next year, he said, ''the floor will be removed and home prices will decline to a more organic level that is not artificially supported.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ROUGHLY 1,500 rental units are gradually being rolled onto the northern New Jersey market starting this spring. One large new building in Hoboken will start leasing this week; several other apartment complexes in both cities and suburbs have opened or are about to, and two tall rental towers are being readied to open early in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It does seem like a lot, coming in a market that has been distressed,'' said David Barry, a principal with Ironstate Development, the company behind the 348-unit 225 Grand, in Jersey City, which starts leasing on May 1, and also a 95-unit building that will open by fall at the Shipyard complex, in Hoboken.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But it's not a tremendous amount,'' Mr. Barry quickly added, ''given that there is always a steady stream of demand for new units, even in a down market for other kinds of housing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he did not sense an impending oversupply of rental units; he and other New Jersey builders have found that the pipeline for future rental units is now being virtually choked off, because of severely tightened standards for granting construction loans. ''Lenders are requiring builders to provide major chunks of equity -- up to 20 or 30 percent of the cost of a project -- before they will consider writing a loan,'' Mr. Barry said. ''Most companies, even larger ones, can't proceed on that basis.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The projects opening in the next six to nine months represent the last housing developments to have been granted construction loans before the housing market ''turned'' and lending standards tightened, said Debra Tantleff, a vice president for development of the Roseland Property Company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Tantleff's company is building the Jersey City high-rise project -- two 50-story buildings, called Monaco Towers, that will house 524 apartments. The development was conceived as condominiums, Ms. Tantleff said. Then, at the time ground was broken in late 2008, Roseland and its partner on the project, Garden State Development, said one tower would be condos, the other probably rental.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ultimately, as sales slowed to a crawl last year, plans changed again; all units are now rentals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Roseland began leasing within the last six weeks at two other new rental buildings it has built in concert with different partners: the Metropolitan at 40 Park in Morristown, and Highlands at Hilltop in Verona.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The seven-story Metropolitan, with 130 units set over ground-floor shops, was built adjacent to the new 40 Park condo building, which faces the historic green in Morristown. Both are part of a downtown redevelopment done in partnership with Woodmont Properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Highlands at Hilltop complex in Verona is a more suburban-style rental community: two four-story buildings, containing 95 apartments and a 4,902-square-foot clubhouse, set on 24 acres.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The one- and two-bedroom units at the Metropolitan are larger, and priced higher. Monthly rates are $1,959 to $3,438. At the Highlands, one- and two-bedroom units go for $1,800 to $3,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both properties are offering two months' free rent with a 14-month lease. ''This is the concession we typically offer,'' Ms. Tantleff said, ''and it is the extent of what we've had to do during a more difficult market.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other developers of projects opening now said they were offering either a month or two in free rent, or -- as Mr. Barry said Ironstate had done -- lowering rates to suit the times.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Tantleff said the appetite for rentals remained strong at all Roseland properties in New Jersey, with occupancy at 98 percent. About 10 units per week have been leased at the Highlands at Hilltop since it opened in late March, and also at the Metropolitan since it opened in early April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Alexan Riverdale, a 212-unit apartment complex that will start leasing next week, the marketing agent reported that 500 people had signed up online or in person to express interest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Alexan, developed by <span class="companylink">Trammell Crow Residential</span>, is the first modern ''luxury'' building to open in the area west of Wayne, said Brian Cheripka, the sales director for the project.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Its design is similar to that of the Alexan CityView in Bayonne, which opened last year. But the Riverdale building, set in woods rather than on the Hudson riverfront, has about 15 acres, and offers an outdoor pool, a barbecue area and walking trails.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We think this is actually a very good time to open rentals in this particular area,'' Mr. Cheripka said. ''We think it boils down to specific submarkets, and demand varies from town to town, county to county -- and there is pent-up demand right here.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In general, the percentage of people who are homeowners -- which climbed to about 70 percent during the boom years -- is declining again, he noted. ''Many people don't see homeownership as a way to build equity anymore, especially younger people,'' Mr. Cheripka said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of empty-nesters come in saying they are ready to trade down to an easier lifestyle,'' he added. ''Bottom line: We see a lot of people anxious to rent.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The planned skyscraper once known as the Freedom Tower was scorned for years by urban planners, downtown residents and real estate executives who regarded it as an oversize and unnecessary exercise in waste and hubris.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the acrimonious debates, cost overruns and lengthy delays in building the tower appear to be over. More than 1,400 workers are pouring concrete and installing girder upon girder. And with the red steel latticework for the obelisk-shape building now rising more than 240 feet at ground zero, it has turned into an object of desire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four major real estate developers are vying to buy a minority stake in the $3.1 billion project and to take over the leasing and operating of the skyscraper. This week, the developers submitted their final offers to the owner, the <span class="companylink">Port Authority of New York and New Jersey</span>, which plans to pick a winner by June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The building has real international significance, and it's important for New York,'' said Stephen M. Ross, chief executive of Related Companies, one of the four companies competing for the $100 million deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the recent Cinderella-like transformation of Freedom Tower, now known as 1 World Trade Center, it still faces a daunting challenge: whether it can attract private companies or will remain a heavily subsidized ''government'' building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Port Authority and its advisers at Cushman &amp;Wakefield are pitching it as the most modern addition to the city's skyline, with first-class restaurants and an observatory at the top that will attract business leaders and tourists alike.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The developers seem to agree. Even Douglas Durst, the chairman of the Durst Organization, whose family opposed both the original World Trade Center and the version being built, has jumped into the competition for the tower, along with Hines, an international real estate developer, and Mortimer B. Zuckerman, the chairman of Boston Properties and the owner of The Daily News.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Vornado Realty Trust</span>, a publicly traded company, and <span class="companylink">Brookfield Properties</span>, the largest downtown landlord, have already been eliminated from the competition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The competing developers acknowledge the immediate challenge of finding enough tenants for the building. But they say that a stake in 1 World Trade Center is a long-term investment in the future of the building and of Lower Manhattan. They said they were confident the area would rebound as both a residential and a commercial community, and some said they were also seeking the cachet of being associated with an internationally known skyscraper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You have to take a patient approach to your capital on this,'' said Tommy Craig, a senior vice president for Hines. ''It's possible to structure the investment so that the risk that's inherent is potentially offset by the return opportunities.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One World Trade Center was a centerpiece of the master plan drawn up in 2003 by the architect Daniel Libeskind. Gov. George E. Pataki added to its patriotic patina by dubbing it the Freedom Tower. David M. Childs of <span class="companylink">Skidmore, Owings &amp;Merrill</span> turned the drawing into a glass tower. But after the Police Department raised security concerns, he was forced to redesign it in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In turn, corporate tenants and government workers declared they had no desire to move in. Some real estate executives railed against building so much expensive office space downtown without any tenants. Eliot Spitzer referred to it as a white elephant while he was running for governor but ultimately authorized its construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initially, the building was ''laden with negative symbolism and emblematic of the delays at ground zero,'' said Julie Menin, the chairwoman of Community Board 1 in Manhattan, whose district includes the trade center site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now,'' she continued, ''all these developers are vying for the site.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 104-story glass tower will sit on a 186-foot pedestal of prismatic glass covering a concrete-and-steel protective structure at the northwest corner of the 16-acre site. A 408-foot spire will rise from the top, bringing the total height to a symbolic 1,776 feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an effort to kick-start the building, federal and state officials promised to lease a total of 1.2 million square feet, or about 40 percent of the tower. Since then, Vantone, a Chinese real estate company, has signed a lease for 190,000 square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The developers wouldn't be interested in the building if they thought it was going to be all government,'' said Tara Stacom, vice chairwoman of Cushman &amp;Wakefield. ''They, too, are convinced that this building will lease to private companies, professional and financial services.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, some developers acknowledge, a rent check from a government agency is as good as one from a private company -- perhaps even more so, since it is usually reliable in coming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Durst, one of the final bidders, said 1 World Trade Center was '' going to be the best building downtown and the only building you'll be able to rent in; we thought we'd go for it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Durst's remark about the ''only building'' was a reference to the competition -- Larry Silverstein, who is known as an inexhaustible negotiator and is building 4 World Trade Center. The two buildings, which will be chasing the same tenants to fill more than one million square feet each, are set to open in 2013.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Silverstein's tower also has government tenants -- the Port Authority and city agencies. And Silverstein executives say their building, on Church Street, is closer to Wall Street and the financial district and, therefore, more likely to attract financial firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I do think they need to attract private companies,'' Ms. Menin said. ''Why should taxpayers have to pay so that various government agencies can have 60-story views at astronomical rents?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Executives at the authority, who are optimistic about the tower's prospects, said they had the expertise to build the tower themselves but were inviting developers in so they could have a partner, with a financial stake in its fate, who could skillfully deal with tenants and their needs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They have hired two real estate companies, Cushman &amp;Wakefield and <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span>, for advice, and have brought in a marketing and branding firm based in London, Wordsearch, specializing in real estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We believe that a private-sector partner with real estate expertise will best operate the building and maximize its value,'' said Anthony Coscia, chairman of the Port Authority. ''But we want to do this in a responsible manner that protects the long-term interests of the authority.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The view from Tom and Jane Justic's eighth-floor condominium in the South Loop -- with Soldier Field in the foreground and majestic Lake Michigan behind it -- is exactly what they were looking for when they moved from Beverly in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the condominium that came with that view has an unexpected and unwelcome additional cost: $850 a month in special assessments for the next five years, to cover the expense of building repairs that were completed late last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The sun still comes up every morning,'' Ms. Justic said one recent afternoon, rolling her eyes in mock reverie.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since it was constructed in 2002, the Justics' 23-story building at 1717 South Prairie Avenue has become an extreme example of the strains and pains that many South Loop condominiums and town houses now face from the area's boom in construction before the market collapsed in late 2008. Once one of the city's hottest real estate markets, the South Loop is crisscrossed by scaffolding and suffused with the frustration and anxiety of litigation between condo boards and developers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Howard Dakoff, a condominium lawyer, said his firm had represented at least 10 South Loop condominium associations in fights over what they alleged was faulty construction in the last decade. But now, as suits brought by Mr. Dakoff and other lawyers have been settled, dismissed or just died in the face of mounting legal costs, the question for those still litigating and for the South Loop residents who remain in a state of real estate limbo is, how long to keep holding on?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of those associations with pending lawsuits are finding themselves financially tapped or too battle-weary to move forward. In addition, persistence in seeking relief can harm a building's reputation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steve Welhouse, another lawyer who has represented several South Loop condominium associations in lawsuits against developers, said there had been varying degrees of success in settlement terms. ''From nothing and poor to O.K.,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the moment, the fight continues over 1717 South Prairie. For residents, the dispute is costly not just in terms of legal fees and special assessments, but also in the energy expended in fights no one expected when they bought their dream homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Justic, who leads the condominium association's budget committee, and his wife have spent a good portion of his early retirement years appealing to the city, their alderman, Robert Fioretti, and the local news media in their effort to make things right. Indeed, though the court fight against the development partnership, 18th &amp;Prairie II L.L.C., is five years old, residents are hoping that they will finally be able to present their case to Judge Brigid Mary McGrath on May 5.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those in the midst of the battle say they were left with no option but to fight. ''My position is that it takes a strong board, and you have to bite the bullet and address it,'' said Anthony Bass, the condominium board's vice president. ''We didn't have a choice.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In its lawsuit, the condominium association claimed that faulty construction resulted in ''severe water infiltration'' and that the developer had failed in its duty to address repair requests made by the board within a year after the condominium turnover.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scaffolding came down in December, after nine months and $6.5 million worth of repairs to replace all of the windows and improve the masonry after severe cases of water leakage. The suit the board filed in 2005 against the developers and subcontractors moves slowly through Cook County Circuit Court.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lead developer, William Warman, recently filed for bankruptcy protection in Florida. His partner in the project, Warren Barr, puts the responsibility squarely on the subcontractors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It has been upsetting to me that it has all developed,'' Mr. Barr said. ''There are two sides to every story and there were efforts to try to fix the building, and I think the building might have wanted more items fixed than may have been needed through warranty provisions.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By last September, Ms. Justic had had enough. She went to City Hall looking for the mayor. She walked up to Richard M. Daley as he stepped onto an elevator, mentioned that their sons had attended school together, and told him about her plight. The next day, a member of Mr. Daley's staff telephoned her. Eventually, the city's Department of Buildings convened a meeting between the subcontractors and the condominium association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the meeting, the board was offered a $500,000 settlement but rejected it, Mr. Justic said. Residents hope the offer will be increased. Mr. Bass, a lawyer, said he paid $1,100 a month for his share of the building's special assessment fees related to what the lawsuit claims is faulty construction. In trying to minimize the board's costs, he has taken on some of the litigation work himself, free.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Probably the mentality of developers is that most of these boards really have to be strong to stay together to litigate,'' Mr. Bass said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But at the end of the day,'' he continued, ''I would tell any condominium association that you don't have a choice. You are either going to pay for it out of your pocket, or are going to get someone else to pay for it. The best thing you have going for you is you aren't alone.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Justic said, ''We are just approaching the point where we may start seeing progress, but I understand we won't see progress for a while.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many residents, satisfaction is hard to come by. While the city has been trying to assist the unit owners at 1717 South Prairie, that kind of support can be a ''double-edged sword,'' Mr. Dakoff said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unit owners who end up calling the city to report faulty construction issues sometimes learn that they have, in effect, called the police on themselves -- opening themselves up to fines and deadlines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bill McCaffrey, a spokesman for the building department, said that the city was looking to revamp its building code regulations, but that any changes were unlikely for at least a year. Since new enforcement guidelines for general contractors were enacted in 2004, the city has filed 90 cases against 45 general contractors and has issued $2 million in fines.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. McCaffrey said the city was typically more inclined to pursue the general contractors than the developers, because development partnerships often were created in a form intended to protect them from such litigation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile, Tina Feldstein, president of the Prairie District Neighborhood Alliance, said, ''Many people are forced into default now because they simply cannot afford their monthly assessment, their special assessment, and they can't refinance because their property wouldn't appraise for what it would have to appraise for.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Feldstein, who works as a real estate agent and owns a town house in the South Loop, said that the community needed to figure out a way to collectively resolve the troubling vestiges of the real estate boom and move on. She surmises that things are 75 percent along their way, but that ''the shakeup is not done.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Feldstein's organization, which started in 2006, has begun to shift gears.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What we are here to do is build a community, to pick up the pieces and move on,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Justics have no intention of moving from 1717 South Prairie. After all, they very much like their view. As for moving on, that will have to come a bit later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, Mr. Justic said, ''There is a justice to be served.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's the season when thoughts, at least those of a certain demographic, turn to surf and sun and real estate on the East End of Long Island, the closer to the water the better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So here's a listing that might get a fair amount of attention:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For sale: prime waterfront property off Long Island's North Shore. 1.5 miles from northeast tip of Orient Point. Upside: waterfront views on private 840-acre island, architectural ruins, rich history. Downside: longtime site for federal biosafety Level 3 pathogen lab that studies foot-and-mouth disease and other contagious animal diseases. Multimillion-dollar cleanup needed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are several steps to take before Plum Island, site of the top-secret federal research lab since 1954, actually goes on sale. But the release last month by the General Services Administration of the environmental impact statement that would precede its sale has begun the process of putting it on the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So local officials and real estate agents are trying to weigh the property's pluses and minuses. On the one hand, it's a developer's dream, a substantial island, most of it in pristine condition, just off the North Fork. On the other, it's a place with a reputation so toxic that only Hannibal Lecter, the homicidal villain of ''The Silence of the Lambs,'' when given the possibility of going there, would purr: ''Plum Island Animal Disease Research Center. Sounds charming.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some Hamptonesque version of Plum Island Estates or the Village at Plum Island is probably a long shot. ''We have plenty of high-end housing in town, and I don't think it's marketable as a resort island with a lot of big houses on it,'' said Scott Russell, the supervisor of the Town of Southold, which includes the island. ''It's famous, but there are a lot famous places where you wouldn't want to build a house.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, some local real estate people don't rule out a rebranding. Others suggest a park or wilderness preserve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Purchased by the federal government at time of the Spanish-American War, Plum Island was the home of an artillery post known as Fort Terry. It later became an antisubmarine base and then was assigned to the Army Chemical Corps before being turned over to the United States Department of Agriculture and then the Department of Homeland Security.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the start, the animal germ facility was viewed with dread. ''When I was growing up, every man, woman, child and dog was supposed to sign a petition to keep it out,'' recalled John Nickles of Lewis &amp;Nickles Real Estate in Southold. ''Hoof and mouth disease sounded like a scary thing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It still lacks a cuddly reputation. Publicity for a 2004 book, ''Lab 257: The Disturbing Story of the Government's Secret Plum Island Germ Laboratory,'' called the lab ''a ticking biological time bomb that none of us can safely ignore.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the lab has long since been embraced locally for its 200 jobs, many of them for highly trained researchers. But when consideration began of consolidating animal research at a $525 million facility that would include diseases that could be spread to humans, Plum Island was no longer in the mix. A site in Kansas has been chosen from among six bidders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Russell said he is still hoping that the Plum Island site remains as is. His second choice would be to turn it into a research facility looking at alternative energy -- tidal, solar, wind. But the sale is part of the financing plan for the new lab, so it seems almost inevitable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One possibility is that an environmental or land-preservation group would buy the island and leave it alone. Other ideas surface regularly. ''I heard a rumor a Native American tribe was going to buy it and put up a casino,'' Mr. Russell said. ''You're going to hear a lot of far-fetched notions.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few people other than those who work on Plum Island have ever stepped foot on it. One is the novelist Nelson DeMille, who specializes in thrillers set on Long Island. For his 1997 book, ''Plum Island,'' (murder, genetically altered viruses, other fun) he was allowed to spend a day there exploring and visiting the lab in a hazmat suit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is, he said, a lovely place that he would like to see turned into some kind of national park. Though he acknowledged that development there would have some appeal: ''There are probably people as perverse as I am who would be interested in a private development for the cachet. There are a lot of people who would probably jump at the opportunity of a Plum Island address.''</p>

</div><div class="author">By DAVID LEONHARDT; Janie Lorber contributed reporting. E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com </div><div>1328 words</div><div>21 April 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In much of the country, for much of the last decade, renting a home has usually been a better financial move than buying one. It's been true in Southern California, San Francisco, Phoenix, Las Vegas and large parts of Florida, the Pacific Northwest and the Northeast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Renting required you to suffer the scorn of many real estate agents and the skepticism of friends and relatives who believed that owning a home was almost always superior. But renting also would have typically saved you thousands of dollars a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, however, the situation is getting more complicated because the housing bust has been playing out unevenly across the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some once bubbly markets, prices have fallen so far that buying a home appears to be a bargain, based on a New York Times analysis of prices and rents in 54 metropolitan areas. In South Florida, Phoenix and Las Vegas, house prices -- relative to rents -- are as low as in places that never experienced a bubble, like Indianapolis and St. Louis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in a handful of other areas, including San Francisco, Seattle and Portland, Ore., house prices remain significantly higher than they were before the bubble began. People who buy a home in these areas will face higher monthly costs than if they rented, even after taking tax deductions into account. As a result, buyers are effectively betting that prices will rise enough in future years to cover the difference.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The country's two biggest metropolitan areas, New York and Los Angeles, are a microcosm of today's more nuanced real estate market. Average house prices across both areas have fallen enough that buying may now be a good deal for many families. Yet there are still significant pockets where renting looks promising -- including parts of Manhattan, the New York suburbs and Orange County, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The buy-versus-rent question is particularly relevant right now. To qualify for an expiring federal tax credit of up to $8,000, home buyers must sign a contract by April 30 and close on the house by June 30. Many economists also expect mortgage rates to rise in coming months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Camela Witters, a 38-year-old trophy engraver in Las Vegas, plans to close on her first home purchase -- a four-bedroom, $164,000 house nearly identical to the one she is now renting -- in the next few days. She decided to buy, she said, when she found out she could save money by doing so. ''I didn't buy a house when everyone did,'' said Ms. Witters, who lives with her companion and their children. ''So I'm kind of taking advantage of all the foreclosures.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Times analysis is based on comparing the costs of buying and renting a similar home, using data from Moody'sEconomy.com, a research firm, and from real estate agents. This kind of comparison can never tell someone for sure what the best financial move will be. But it does show whether a buyer will need a big jump in future prices to cover all the costs of owning -- including the down payment, closing costs, property taxes, mortgage interest, repairs and co-op fees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A simple way to do the comparison is to look at something called the rent ratio: the purchase price of a house divided by the annual cost of renting a similar one. The number 20 provides a useful rule of thumb. When you do the math, you discover that a ratio above 20 means you should at least consider renting, especially if you may move again in the next five years or so. When the ratio is well below 20, the case for buying becomes a lot stronger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In many large metropolitan areas, including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Dallas, Atlanta and South Florida, the average ratio is now 16 or lower. It was more than 25 in several of these places at the peak of the bubble, about five years ago. With a ratio as low as 16 and interest rates as low as they are, the costs of owning can be less than the costs of renting -- and buyers will end up worse off only if prices fall considerably more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A two-bedroom Spanish-style condominium in Beverly Hills, Calif., for example, recently went on the market for $1.075 million, notes Don Heller of <span class="companylink">Prudential California Realty</span>. Including taxes, condo fees and the tax deduction for mortgage interest, a typical buyer making a 20 percent down payment would face an effective monthly payment of about $6,000. Compare that with the monthly rent on a similar two-bedroom condo nearby -- $7,600.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The math works out similarly in less costly areas, too, be it once booming cities like Phoenix and Orlando, Fla.; Midwestern cities like Minneapolis and Cleveland; or the outer-ring suburbs of most big cities. Much of New York's outer boroughs appear to fall into this category.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem for potential buyers is that many real estate agents argue for buying even in places where the numbers don't add up. In the Bay Area, the rent ratio remains around 30. In Seattle, it's about 28. In parts of Manhattan, it appears to be about 25, according to current listings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In most markets, you're better off buying,'' Thomas Lys, an accounting professor at Northwestern University, says. ''But once the ratio gets to 25 or 30, I'd say, 'You know what? There may be a bubble.'''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rent ratio has long been higher in New York and San Francisco than most places, perhaps because of zoning rules or because the cities are home to large numbers of affluent households willing to pay extra to own. So it's possible that prices will not fall. But they are already high enough that the monthly costs of owning often exceed the cost of renting -- even without taking into account the down payment or other one-time costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A big reason is that prices still haven't fallen much in some places. In Rye, N.Y., the average per-square-foot sale price was only 9 percent lower early this year than at its 2007 peak, according to MDA <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span>. Some similarly affluent parts of the Los Angeles, Miami and San Diego areas have experienced declines of 25 to 50 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Obviously, owning a home brings benefits that are not strictly financial. It offers stability and, for many people, comfort. As I have written, I bought a house in 2008 (in part because the rent ratio in my area had fallen to about 16). Even in Manhattan, San Francisco or Seattle, a family confident that it will stay put for a decade or more may well be wise to buy today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it's worth remembering that the advantages of homeownership are frequently exaggerated. The mortgage-interest tax deduction doesn't eliminate the cost of borrowing money; it merely reduces it. The freedom to paint your house any color you wish comes with the responsibility of paying for a new roof when the time comes. The $15,000 or $30,000 or $50,000 that real estate agents' fees add to the price of a house can wipe out a lot of other savings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most striking part of the current situation may be that despite everything that has happened in the last few years, there are still places where renting does not get enough respect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CHARTS: How to Decide: One way to figure out whether to buy or rent is to look at the rent ratio: the purchase price of a typical house divided by the annual rent of a similar house. A number above 20 means you should consider renting. A number well below 20 makes a better case for buying. (Source: <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com) (A3)</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MIAMI -- Though it overlooks the Atlantic Ocean and offers high-end amenities like a wine vault and a cigar humidor, the Caribbean condominium complex in Miami Beach seemed by last summer to be just another casualty of the glutted South Florida housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were buyers for all 103 units in the complex, which includes a small renovated Art Deco building and a new glass tower, but only 14 had been willing to close. The rest had simply walked away from their deposits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Caribbean, at 37th Street and Collins Avenue, resulted in heavy losses for its developers, a partnership of Christa Development of Victor, N.Y., and Bluerock Real Estate of New York City, and its lender, the now-defunct Corus Bankshares of Chicago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it has reaped a nice profit for another real estate investor, Melohn Properties, also of New York City, which assumed control of the property after buying the $127.7 million mortgage from Corus last August. Melohn paid less than half the face value of the loan, according to the building's broker, Diane Lieberman, the owner of SBI Realty in Miami Beach.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are now just 15 units left at the Caribbean, Ms. Lieberman said. Originally priced around $1,100 a square foot, the condos are selling for an average of $600 a square foot, with those on a high floor with wraparound terraces selling at $750 a square foot. Most of the buyers paid cash, and all plan to use the condos themselves, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter Zalewski, the owner of Condo Vultures, a brokerage firm that specializes in selling units in bulk, said a dozen other investors had taken a look at the Caribbean loan and passed. ''Now they're all having remorse,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the Miami market remains deeply troubled, it is no longer moribund, real estate specialists say. Activity is picking up, though buyers who intend to live in their units are primarily interested in top properties in the best locations, said Robert Kaplan, a principal of Olympian Capital Group, a real estate investment bank in Miami. Even though the Caribbean is opposite a stalled project and is north of South Beach, its ocean views and solid construction are attractive, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers say that South Beach, because of its glamorous night life and smaller inventory as well as its proximity to the ocean, continues to do much better than downtown, with its canyons of new high-rise condos.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From May through December last year, 1,000 new units sold in downtown Miami -- an area from Brickell Avenue north to the Julia Tuttle Causeway -- according to a study prepared for the Miami Downtown Development Authority, a quasi-independent city agency. But the majority of the buyers were investors, many of them from South America, real estate specialists said. And though occupancy in new downtown buildings increased to 74 percent from 68 percent, more than half of the new residents were renters, and 7,000 of the 22,000 new condo units built since 2003 remained unsold. Most are in the Brickell area, where much of the new construction is concentrated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the study was completed, another 700 units have sold downtown, Mr. Zalewski said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A big chunk of these sales were made at the Icon Brickell, a new 1,646-unit condominium complex that became a symbol of downtown excess because of features like as a $15 million entryway with 100 sculptured columns. By the end of last year, only 125 condos had sold, with an average price of $543 a square foot, Mr. Zalewski's data shows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since January, however, 199 sales have closed at the complex, which is situated where the Miami River meets Biscayne Bay. But the average price in the first quarter was $404 a square foot and about 30 units have sold for less than $300 a square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In South America, a Brickell address is like a U.S. savings bond,'' said Jay Massirman, a senior managing director of <span class="companylink">Related Group of Florida</span>, which developed the complex. ''They know that prices are not going any lower. He said buyers also know they are buying for less than it cost to build the units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over all, condo prices in Miami-Dade County have declined by 51 percent since 2007, when the median price was $275,000, said Ronald A. Shuffield, the president of <span class="companylink">Esslinger-Wooten-Maxwell Realtors</span> of Coral Gables. Last month, 2,381 condos in the county went to contract -- nearly twice as many as in March 2009 -- but the median price had slipped to $135,000, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the increase in sales may not translate into higher prices. With so many investment sales, many units will come back to the market when prices begin to rise, in turn keeping prices down, said Lewis M. Goodkin, a real estate analyst and a co-author of the downtown association's report. ''So we're far from out of the woods,'' Mr. Goodkin said. ''I think we have a minimum of five years left before we have equilibrium in the market.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jack McCabe, a real estate consultant in Deerfield Beach, Fla., said rents had fallen so far that a new condo with 1,200 square feet could be leased for as little as $1,200 a month, less than what it cost most owners to cover their expenses. ''The mini-boom is not creating a healthy real estate market,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the influx of renters has meant that downtown no longer looks like a ghost town. More lights are on at night, and new shops and restaurants have opened. ''It's bringing a vibrancy to the downtown that we haven't ever felt here,'' said Alyce Robertson, the executive director of the downtown association. Two <span class="companylink">Publix</span> supermarkets have been added to downtown since the mini-boom began. While some stores and restaurants closed during the recession, and a planned Whole Foods never materialized, the area had a net gain of 42 retailers in 2009, Ms. Robertson said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers said more owner-occupiers were in the market now that both <span class="companylink">Fannie Mae</span> and <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span> had loosened restrictions that made it harder for prospective buyers to get loans. Some condos in foreclosure had even received multiple bids, said Lucas Lechuga, a sales agent with <span class="companylink">Keller Williams Realty</span> in Miami. Mr. Lechuga said one of his clients lost out on a one-bedroom condo at the Vue at Brickell in downtown Miami that was listed at $142,500 but sold for $225,000. Buyers do not seem deterred even in cases when the previous owner made off with the appliances, Mr. Lechuga said. ''It's crazy what I've been seeing in the last three months,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But anyone looking for a bargain at the Paramount Bay, at North East 21st Street and North Bayshore Drive, or at the new Mint, on the Miami River at South West Third Street, will have to wait. The two developments were part of Corus's $5 billion national loan portfolio. Starwood Capital and several partners bought a 40 percent stake in the portfolio in January in a deal valued at $2.77 billion. ''It will be some time before we are offering units for sale to the public at either property,'' said Tom Johnson, a spokesman for Starwood, which is managing the portfolio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To make the portfolio attractive, the <span class="companylink">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span> took a majority stake and provided $1 billion in interest-free financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our purchase price for Corus coupled with the unusual financing we have in place allows us to be very patient,'' Barry Sternlicht, chief executive of Starwood, said in an e-mail message.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Craig A. Werley, the president of Focus Real Estate Advisors, a Miami consulting firm, and a co-author of the downtown study, said Starwood would be well-positioned in the future when other new buildings had sold out. ''They are sitting in the catbird seat.'' he said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bankers who have spent two decades quoting Gordon Gekko's sayings -- or what they remember Gekko saying -- like ''Greed is good'' and ''Lunch is for wimps'' hope to lap up more of his insights when the sequel, ''Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps,'' comes out this fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One person trying to cash in on the hype is the owner of a Chelsea penthouse, a 6,250-square-foot duplex with four bedrooms, five baths and 3,500 square feet of outdoor space at 31 West 21st Street. It is where Gekko's new protege and soon-to-be son-in-law, played by Shia LaBeouf, lives in the movie. Mr. Gekko's daughter, played by Carey Mulligan, can be seen sitting in its bedroom in a trailer for the film.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jonathan Isaacs of Aligned Real Estate said the owner was selling now because he is spending more time in Florida and thinks there is enough excitement about the movie to draw buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While greed may not be as well received as it was in recent years, bankers have enough of a budding interest to spend again on pricey apartments, Mr. Isaacs said -- especially homes associated with the male literary equivalent of Scarlett O'Hara or Elizabeth Bennet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Most of my clients have already seen the trailer. They know they're making the sequel to the best-known finance movie of all time,'' Mr. Isaacs said. ''There will certainly be a very interested group.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment got the part in the movie through connections: Mr. Isaacs said the owner knows a location manager for the movie. The location manager visited several times, at different times of day and on rainy and sunny days, to make sure it would work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Celia Costas, the location manager on the 1987 ''Wall Street'' movie and an executive producer on the sequel, said that Oliver Stone fell in love with the apartment the minute he saw it: its floating staircase, terraces and ''a killer, dead-on view of the Empire State Building.'' She also said that a loft fit Mr. LaBeouf's character because ''this to us would be where a young, hip up-and-coming master of the universe would want to be.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Isaacs said that it took the film crew only 10 days to get their shots. The crew cleared the entire apartment of the owner's furniture and replaced the kitchen and living room space with more updated furniture. The apartment's distinctive vertigo-inducing stairs remain in the movie. The crew respected the owner's requests to preserve his walnut floors by wearing special booties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The owner, not surprisingly, works in finance. He declined to comment, saying the bank he works for would not allow it; because of populist anger over Wall Street bailouts, financial institutions have been asking their high earners to keep as low a profile as possible. He did not even want to be named.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So with a meticulousness that Gekko would admire, the owner cleared his apartment of nearly all traces of his identity before a reporter and photographer visited. He does not have his name on his buzzer and his brokers did not allow access to his home office. There were no outward signs of his name in his apartment except for a black ''RMW'' monogram on his bathroom towels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, he left a few clues about himself. The space is filled with a mix of passed-down family heirlooms and signs that a sportsman lives there. Behind the apartment's tall mahogany doors, the owner has filled his custom closets with painstakingly organized baseball gloves, skis and Dartmouth caps and sweatshirts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His front closet has more than two dozen brown and black coats. In his walk-in bedroom closet, he has more than two dozen pairs of khaki pants, 10 sweatshirts and rows upon rows of shoes. His linen closet is filled with only white sheets. In his screening room were a copy of the Vanity Fair ''Money'' issue and five books -- all about finance. His movie collection includes ''The Hobbit,'' ''Taxi Driver'' and ''Lost in Translation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The owner bought the apartment in 2003 for $1.4 million. After conducting extensive renovations, including constructing the second floor, he put it up for sale in January 2008 for the Gekkospheric price of $16.5 million, according to the Web site StreetEasy.com. He lowered the price to $14.5 million and then $13.7 million, and is now considering asking $12 million to $14 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That would run to roughly $2,000 a square foot, but his brokers compare it to recent sales at neighborhood buildings like the Chelsea Mercantile at 252 Seventh Ave., where a much smaller 11th-floor apartment recently closed for $1,813 per square foot, and the Grand Madison at 225 Fifth Avenue where a penthouse recently closed for $2,833 per square foot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Costas said it was much harder to persuade apartment owners to let their homes be used in the 1987 movie because they were wary of being involved with a film about finance involving a director who was at the time less well known. The first movie was filmed in a condo building in the East 50s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While it was easier to get access to properties for the sequel, Ms. Costas said she was challenged to capture ''how the community that was millionaires and is now gazillionaires'' lives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clearly, much about Manhattan properties has changed since the first ''Wall Street,'' in which a real estate agent -- said to be modeled on Linda Stein, who was killed by her personal assistant in 2007 -- told Charlie Sheen's character: ''Everybody tells you they hate the Upper East Side. They wanna live on the West Side. But believe me, when it's resale time, the East Side moves all the time. I mean what do you got on the West Side? Sean and Madonna?''</p>

</div><div class="author">By LAURIE UDESKY </div><div>1554 words</div><div>18 April 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>National Edition</div><div>27A</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September 2009, Sgt. Rick Turini of the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office drove to a house in San Jose to carry out a court-ordered eviction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With foreclosures in Bay Area counties near all-time highs, the office had been routinely evicting 35 to 40 households a week. But this property was different: It was a board-and-care home for the elderly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither the residents nor their families had been warned about an eviction, said Sergeant Turini, who does not recall the home's exact address.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he arrived with his partner, the house was still occupied, and the distraught daughter of an elderly bedridden woman was struggling to get her mother into a car. A couple of teenagers doing homework in the living room looked up at the officers in shock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We got a call from Adult Protective Services letting us know that the house we were evicting had four or five bedridden residents, and the guy was ignoring the eviction notice,'' Sergeant Turini said, referring to the owner. ''I couldn't believe it had gone this far.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the sheriff's department worked with agencies to arrange for the fragile inhabitants to be transferred to other facilities or sent home with relatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Here at the sheriff's office we're not going to put a person who can't take care of themselves out on the street,'' the sergeant said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of a loophole in the law, owners of residential-care facilities for the elderly -- who often double as administrators -- do not have to tell their residents or the residents' families if they miss mortgage payments or are on the brink of foreclosure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An analysis of data by The New York Times shows that more than 100 elder-care homes in the Bay Area were under foreclosure in the last six months, and that as many as 700 residents -- who often need help with bathing, eating and other daily activities -- may have faced eviction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time they are licensed by the California Department of Social Services, owners of the homes are required to show enough financial wherewithal only to cover three months of operating costs. Unless complaints are made to the agency, current law requires that these homes be visited only every five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Who is minding the shop?'' asked Anthony Chicotel, a staff lawyer with the California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform, which is cosponsoring legislation to increase protections for elderly residents in these homes. ''The law doesn't really say. There's no obligation for them to do anything if they fall into financial distress.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This means residents, their family members and even the staff providing care may not find out about a property's financial troubles until they see an eviction notice or a sheriff at the door.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Armed police officers could forcibly remove residents from their homes ''without any notice, without preparation, without any arrangements for an alternative residence,'' Mr. Chicotel said. ''Not only are they losing their home, but they are losing the services that allow them to live.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tippy Irwin, executive director of the Ombudsman Services of San Mateo, said this trend of ousting elderly residents without warning was ''unprecedented.'' Her office has handled eight foreclosures of elder-care homes in the last two years, and few owners gave warning to residents or their families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Irwin said her staff had to scramble to find new places for the residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In one residence, we got wind that the sheriff had issued a three-day notice to move people in the house, and that was a Friday,'' she said. ''We had to move them all in one day. It's not the way it should happen.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Every one of these owners has been in denial,'' Ms. Irwin continued. ''They themselves are going through hell. They're losing their homes and their businesses. Not one of them has acknowledged what's happening.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brenda Wing experienced this denial first-hand in February when she went to visit her 84-year-old father in the Northstar Manor care home in Woodland. When she arrived, Ms. Wing said, there were three papers stapled to the door that said the house was going to be sold at auction. She called Stephanie Khan, the administrator, and was told that it was a misunderstanding, that the owners were refinancing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, on April 7, the sheriff served an eviction notice, Ms. Wing said. She called again, and Ms. Khan again said it was a misunderstanding.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, Ms. Wing said, the conversation turned ugly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''She was really angry and said, 'You're asking me about personal finances!' '' Ms. Wing said. ''I said, 'No, I'm asking you if my dad is going to be put out on the street!' It was such a hideous conversation that I had to hang up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Khan confirmed the conversation and the posting of the eviction notice, but said that a loan modification was being negotiated and that the bank had lost the paperwork.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I wouldn't tell her about my mom's financial business unless it affects the residents,'' Ms. Khan said, ''and the loan modification attorney said that it won't affect the residents.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She refused to identify the loan modification lawyer, but said that if she and her mother had been told to evacuate the premises, she would have told the residents and their families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I would tell them to find alternative housing and give them enough time,'' Ms. Khan said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Records from <span class="companylink">DataQuick</span>, a firm that tracks 83 million properties in the United States, show that Northstar Manor was foreclosed on and is now owned by Wells Fargo Bank. Kevin Waetke, a <span class="companylink">Wells Fargo Home Mortgage</span> spokesman, confirmed the bank's ownership, but said that as soon as the bank learned it was a care facility with elderly residents, it delayed the eviction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are working closely with the families and have assured them that we will provide all the time they need to relocate the residents in appropriate housing, however long it takes,'' Mr. Waetke said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alexandra Morris, a gerontologist working with the Alzheimer's Association of Northern California, said that many occupants of these homes had dementia, and that an abrupt change could cause severe anxiety and decline known as transfer trauma.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People with dementia focus on familiar people, and familiar aspects of an environment,'' Ms. Morris said. ''That's their anchor, and they can quite literally feel adrift when they have to move.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Agencies that oversee these residential-care facilities for the elderly -- which typically house up to six patients -- have no reliable data on which homes are threatened with foreclosure or have closed because of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But a New York Times analysis of licensing and foreclosure data indicated that about 16 percent of the 1,600 Bay Area properties licensed as small residential-care homes has been in some stage of foreclosure since June 2006. According to RealtyTrac, a company that compiles foreclosure records, that includes more than 100 homes under foreclosure in the last six months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is impossible to tell from the data how many of these were operating as residential-care homes during the foreclosure proceedings or thereafter. But those properties housed as many as 700 elderly residents.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thelma Tan's elder-care home, April Garden, in Saratoga, was among the properties in foreclosure on a list RealtyTrac updated April 4. Ms. Tan said she worked out a deal with her lender on April 5 and defended her decision to keep staff and residents in the dark.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's no need to alarm the families,'' she said. ''Of course, if something drastic was going to happen, we're required to give them notice.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charles Skoien, Jr., director of the Community Residential Care Association of California, said he was unaware of the spate of foreclosures and evictions in elder-care facilities. He said the licensing agency should be in those facilities long before ''something like that is going down.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked about legislation that would tighten requirements, Mr. Skoien said: ''I think we have adequate regulations now. I don't think we need more.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">State Senator Mark Leno, Democrat of San Francisco, has introduced legislation that would make it less likely that the elderly residents in these care facilities would have no warning of a pending foreclosure. It would require people licensed to run such facilities to notify the licensing division of the Department of Social Services and the residents or their legal representative within 24 hours of notification of foreclosure, bankruptcy, missing a mortgage payment or the prospect of a utility cutoff.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bill would also fine owners who failed to do so $100 a day, and permanently disqualify them from operating elder-care homes in California. A vote on the measure is not expected before June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Irwin, the San Mateo ombudsman, hopes it will pass.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've had a terrible time in this county, and we kicked up a storm,'' she said. ''We need these protections in the law.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW MILFORD, Conn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE fashion designer Diane Von Furstenberg is planning an unusual addition to Cloudwalk, the 100-acre farm she owns here in Litchfield County: a family cemetery and meditation garden, enclosed by a stone wall and surrounded by cherry trees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her application for a permit for up to 20 plots was approved last month by the town Zoning Commission and recently received approval from the state Department of Health.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Von Furstenberg's desire to spend eternity on her country estate might not be the harbinger of a new wave of home burials, though Joshua Slocum, the director of the Funeral Consumers Alliance in Burlington, Vt., says he has been fielding more inquiries lately.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Burial at home was once common in the country, and family cemeteries and plots can be found on many historic properties. But while they have intrinsic appeal to genealogists and historians, their effect on housing values depends a lot on who is buying, real estate agents said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm always thinking of the resale,'' said Jane Weber, a Realtor with Henderson <span class="companylink">Sotheby's International Realty</span> in Princeton, N.J. ''So, I'd say it's not good. Most of my clients in this area are younger, and they are not interested in someone else's family history.'' Ms. Weber said that a recent client refused even to look at a $3 million property because it was next to a small family cemetery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was about the size of a tennis court,'' Ms. Weber said, ''but he spotted it on <span class="companylink">Google</span> Earth and said, 'No way.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some people even want to know if pets are buried on the property, she added.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home burials are legal outside city limits in most states, although towns and counties may develop ordinances covering maintenance and proximity to water supplies, power lines, neighbors, and rights-of-way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A home burial can be a very meaningful, personal and charming thing to do,'' said Mr. Slocum of the Funeral Consumers Alliance. ''But I always ask people how long are they going to keep this land and will they still be happy with the situation if there is a change of ownership?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Von Furstenberg's family cemetery will not be visible from the road, and she has established a trust to maintain the cemetery in perpetuity, according to her zoning application.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Washington, Conn., a few miles north of Ms. Von Furstenberg's property, Samuel Averill, 63, operates his family's apple orchard on 260 acres. The property also includes a graveyard dating to the 1740s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everyone in my family has been buried there, plus a few farmhands,'' said Mr. Averill, who mows the lawn on the site; a small trust has also been set up by the family for maintenance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But private cemeteries that remain under the same family's stewardship for generations are rare. More often they are abandoned once relatives die off or move away. Some return to the earth, disappearing with barely a trace. Others, lovingly preserved by strangers, or more often, tumbled and overgrown, are local landmarks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robyn Kammerer, the executive director of communications for Halstead Property, grew up in Darien, Conn., a town rich in Revolutionary history -- and home to the occasional backyard soldier's grave.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We don't showcase whether a house has a graveyard on it,'' Ms. Kammerer said. ''But most buyers looking at antique houses embrace the history, and gravestones are sometimes part of that story.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People often make the mistake of thinking that when they buy property with a private cemetery on it, they own the plot. ''But they don't,'' Mr. Slocum said -- at least not to the extent that they can do anything they want with it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is illegal to dismantle cemeteries or remove gravestones. Property owners must go through a lengthy legal process before altering such a site, often requiring that they obtain permission from relatives. Other avenues include seeking a court order to have the graves moved to another cemetery, or trying to deed the land to a municipality so as to shift responsibility for its care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Connecticut, statutes allow towns to take over the maintenance of burial grounds ''containing more than six places of interment and not under the control or management of any currently functioning cemetery association.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while some people are put off by the presence of cemeteries, there are others who go to great lengths to create the illusion of a home burial ground, and not just on Halloween.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Justin Primeaux, a Realtor with Elyse Harney Real Estate in Litchfield County, said he knew of an owner of a Victorian house who built a fictitious graveyard on his property using weathered old gravestones that he had bought at an antiques store.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">George Folchi of New Milford isn't sure what lies beneath the gravestone that stands in the front yard of his circa-1700 house. He discovered the marker, which had been obscured by brush and debris, after he bought the house in 1996.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The inscription reads: ''Ruby, wife of Grishom W. French, died May 14, 1812.'' Mr. Folchi found no records of her in property deeds. But he cleared away the brush and now mows carefully around the stone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It kind of goes with the property,'' Mr. Folchi said. Besides, he added, ''there's only one way to find out if there's really a body buried down there, and I'm not about to do that.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Albanese, 44, is a principal of the Albanese Organization.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company, based in Garden City, N.Y., develops and manages office and residential buildings. Its Solaire rental building in Battery Park City was the country's first green residential high-rise, receiving a LEED gold rating in 2003. Its Visionaire and Verdesian towers were certified platinum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q How are sales at the Visionaire, your new condominium?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A We're over 65 percent sold. We're very happy with the velocity -- we've been selling at least one a week. We were selling 8 to 10 a month before Lehman failed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Have prices come down a lot?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A At the peak we were averaging $1,300 a foot. One of the top penthouses went for about $1,700 a square foot, and other prime apartments for as much as $1,900. Now we're averaging $1,150.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q How about rents?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A At the Solaire, we were $65 a foot; now we're about $55 a foot. So a two-bedroom at 1,100 square feet would have a monthly rent of about $5,000, and when the market was hot, we were at $6,000. The one-bedrooms -- we have some very large ones, at about 900 square feet -- were about $4,500 when the market was at its peak. Now they're $3,900.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q What incentives are you offering renters?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A We were giving a month free rent, but currently we are not offering any rental concessions. Our apartment buildings are 100 percent occupied.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Is business good over all?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A We can't complain. We don't have any difficult projects. When building prices and land values started going through the roof in '05 and '06, we stopped buying. We also didn't over leverage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q What is the average debt level?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Our office buildings are leveraged 70 to 75 percent; our apartment buildings, 60 to 70 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q So why the focus on green?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A We've always strived to build better, more efficient buildings -- the thinking being that when you hit a down market the better buildings withstand the storm a lot better. Even going back to the '80s, when other developers were putting in inexpensive through-the-wall units, we were doing a four-pipe HVAC fan coil system, a standard in a five-star hotel.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q What have you done to improve air and water quality?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A At the Visionaire, air is filtered as it's drawn in from the roof, pumped directly into every room of every apartment and refiltered at the fan coil unit. In the wintertime, when the air is very dry, air is also humidified.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The water is also doubly filtered. The Solaire, Visionaire and our Verdesian rental tower have recycled ''gray water'' plants, where water is reused for toilets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q So is it easier filling up green apartments?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Families appreciate the green aspects the most -- especially people with young kids -- knowing that the air quality is better and that there are less V.O.C.'s, or volatile organic compounds, in the building. And I think that as years go on, green building will be the standard. So 10 or 15 years from now, when more condos are green, the Visionaire won't be dated. The people who buy now are buying future technology.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Is your home on Long Island green?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A I bought an old house, so I renovated as green as I could. I did simple things, like filtering the water; all the zones have filters to filter the air; using green paints; installing more energy-efficient windows. I've tried to make sure that even the old parts of the house have been insulated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Any new projects planned?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A We are looking at busted condo projects; we've looked at defaulted loans on office buildings, hotels and land. One lender wanted us to get involved in a condo and we passed on it, because we didn't like the project. But there are other busted or stalled condo projects that we would get involved in. The banks have been very slow to dispose of property. This time next year we will see banks selling a lot more property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q You've worked consistently with <span class="companylink">Pelli Clarke Pelli Architects</span>. Why?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A We've done three buildings with Rafael Pelli. Some ''starchitects'' have a reputation of not being developer-friendly. He's extremely creative and he's visionary -- and he understands buildings need to come in on time and on budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Are you frustrated by the delays in rebuilding the World Trade Center?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A I'm surprised that it has taken as long as it has. It's a very important part of downtown living, so, yes, it is frustrating that there hasn't been more progress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We are seven or eight blocks south, so, no, it doesn't affect us directly, but having the development move forward would be big for the whole downtown community.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PRINCETON BOROUGH</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ARRIVING on the market sometime this spring or summer after 20 years of planning and controversy -- and more than 70 years after a namesake mixed-use development started taking shape nearby -- the first phase of the elegant 100-unit Palmer Square condominium adjacent to Princeton University will emerge at a time when the appetite for elegance is generally slack.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of that delay is due to a struggle to define and enforce the developers' responsibility to create affordable-housing units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The development agreement struck in 2004 between Palmer Square Management and borough authorities specified that 10 units within the Palmer Square mixed-use development would be made available as moderately priced rentals, in exchange for permission to build the 100 luxury condo units. The borough had initially pushed for 20 of the new condo units to be affordable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asking prices for the luxury town-house and one-story units at the Residences at Palmer Square range from $1.2 million to $3 million. The starting price has been reduced from the $1.3 million figure announced last year, as a concession to economic realities, marketing agents said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We could not ignore what's going on in the 'real world,' '' said Jay Goldberg of the Stasse &amp;Company agency. ''But interest is starting to build, and traffic is high. We think that people will unquestionably want to live here.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David S. Newton, the vice president of Palmer Square Management, which owns and manages the mixed-use Palmer Square development, begun in 1937 and expanded in the 1980s, acknowledged that the 2008 start date for this project was ''just when it looked like the world might be coming to an end for luxury housing development,'' but said, ''We made a commitment to the borough to build it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also said the company -- then known as Collins Development Corporation -- ''almost had no choice but to proceed with the original vision for Palmer Square and the established level of sophistication and historic style.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three-story town houses and four-story condo buildings are being built on what was formerly a grassy field, set behind the Palmer Square commercial area and not far from a modest neighborhood of single-family homes and rental apartments. Eleven units are near completion -- five town houses and six one-floor condos -- and will be ready for marketing and sale as soon as state housing authorities grant final approvals, Mr. Goldberg said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forty more units are in various stages of completion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The target buyers are older adults, probably longtime homeowners who have a yen for ''sumptuous downsizing,'' as Mr. Newton put it. The condos range in size from 1,650 square feet to 3,200 square feet for the town houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every unit is to have at least two bedrooms (town houses have at least three, as well as three and a half baths and an elevator). All are to have high ceilings, tall windows, expensive appliances and finishes throughout, gas fireplaces, and assigned spaces in a parking garage beneath the buildings. Many will also have private terraces or Juliet balconies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the late 1930s and early '40s the original developer, Edgar Palmer, envisioned Palmer Square as a revival of the colonial square, a place where people could live, work and shop within walking distance. (That notion is once again popular; planners call the style New Urbanism.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Mr. Palmer died, deeding his partly finished project to the university, which held on to it until 1981, making no changes, and then sold to Collins. The company poured $100 million into its investment, expanding shops and office buildings, and converting more than 100 small rental units above the shops to condominiums.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By 1990, plans were in place for the next 100 units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it took 14 years of sometimes racially charged debate about how many and what type of lower-cost units would be part of the plan, before the next six years could be devoted to readying the first units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At one point in the debate, a borough official asserted concern that a ''golden ghetto'' was taking shape at Palmer Square: a few blocks of concentrated affluence butting up against a less privileged neighborhood, historically populated by African-Americans and recent immigrants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The comment touched on racial tensions long simmering in the community. ''Nothing happens in a hurry in Princeton,'' Mr. Newton said. ''But the 'golden ghetto' issue was the biggest challenge impeding progress with the housing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eight of the 10 moderately priced rentals -- in part of the development finished in the '80s -- are now ready, Mr. Newton said; they are to be leased by tenants who meet eligibility requirements. Two more units, a one-bedroom and a studio, will be identified and delivered as soon as possible, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In February Gov. Christopher J. Christie set up a committee to devise a new system for encouraging development of lower-priced units. Mr. Christie also froze all activity by the existing regulatory board, the Council on Affordable Housing. Mr. Newton said, however, that his company's agreement was with the town, not the state regulatory agency, and that plans at Palmer Square would be unaffected.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently, there is very little on the market in Princeton Borough, which is an independent community within Princeton Township. The inventory of homes for sale is two and a half months, which Jeffrey G. Otteau, a real estate industry consultant, described as scant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has been decades since any new housing has gone up in the borough. But this spring, in addition to the Palmer Square condos, a rental building is nearing completion. Its developer, Jack Morrison, said rents in the 53-unit building would range from $1,900 to $3,000 a month.</p>

</div><div class="author">By DAVID STREITFELD </div><div>581 words</div><div>17 April 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a modest sign that the housing market is moving toward more normal conditions, the pace of home building is finally picking up from its near-death levels.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Census Bureau reported Friday that housing starts in March rose 1.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 626,000. It was the third consecutive monthly increase, and better than analysts had been predicting. The rate is now 31 percent above the record low set last April.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Adding to the sense of momentum was a significant upward adjustment to the February numbers, which were originally reported as 575,000, a decline of 5.9 percent, but now revised to 616,000, an increase of 1.1 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However welcome these numbers are to builders, they are very small improvements when set against the context of construction's steep fall over the last several years. At the height of the boom, more than two million homes were being built annually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The increase in construction this winter was most likely spurred by the government's tax credit for homebuyers, which is speeding toward expiration with little likelihood of being renewed. Deals have to be signed by the end of this month to qualify, although they can take two more months to close.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Joshua Shapiro, an economist with the consulting firm MFR, estimated that a considerable amount of the recent activity was a result of the tax credit, and that housing starts would soon suffer another setback. That in turn would act as a considerable damper on the economy, which would have to recover despite housing, not because of it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Although signaling something better than the paralyzed conditions that prevailed a year and more ago, these data indicate that home builders are not seeing a dramatic recovery in demand,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While more homes are finally being built, there are reports that the millions of homes in foreclosure limbo might finally be making their way back to the market. Builders have to compete for new buyers with rock-bottom repossessed homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another reason for caution is that most of the increase in March was in multi-unit construction, which tends to be volatile. Single-family home starts actually fell slightly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, a consumer survey released Friday by the University of Michigan sounded a bleak note for the home building industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consumers said current conditions were not so bad, but their worries were increasing for the future. The survey's overall index dropped to 69.5 in April from 73.6 in March. The new level was the lowest since November. The historical average is 86.5.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This turnaround, like all good things, takes time,'' said Jennifer H. Lee, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Builders remain gloomy. Earlier this week, the National Association of Home Builders reported that sentiment among builders as measured by its monthly index had risen to 19 in April, from 15 in March.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That rise is roughly equivalent to moods improving from miserable to merely dejected. An index level above 50, which has not been seen since the boom, indicates bullish sentiment. The record low was 8, set in January 2009.</p>

</div><div class="author">By LAURIE UDESKY   </div><div>695 words</div><div>17 April 2010</div><div>NYT Blogs</div><div>NYTB</div><div>English</div><div>© 2010 The New York Times Company. All rights reserved   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Headlines everywhere have described the foreclosure tsunami that continues to overwhelm the housing market. Less noticed has been the impact on single-family homes that are used as lucrative care facilities for the elderly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In California, residents of such homes pay an average of $2,500 a month for a shared bedroom and $3,500 a month for a private bedroom, according to California Registry, which helps place senior citizens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But, as my article in Sunday's Bay Area report describes, financial overreaching by some proprietors has led to foreclosure, and some elderly residents and their relatives have learned of this only when a notice is tacked on the house or sheriff's deputies arrive to evict them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My reporting also provided a look at the shadowy side of the business of buying and selling properties for licensed elder care.The commercial real estate Web site loopnet.com advertises a six-bed board and care facility for elderly in "the heart of San Francisco," whose owner "needs to sell." The ad calls the asking price of $155,000 "a steal," citing a $14,000 monthly income from its six residents and a five-year term of "interest-only payments." But, the ad warns, "Do Not Approach Care Home as Staff are unaware of the sale."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes even the licensed administrators managing an elder care home have been blindsided by an eviction notice resulting from a mortgage default. Inocencia Arindaeng, the administrator of a facility in Walnut Creek, Calif., has said in court documents that this happened to her. She had signed a "lease to purchase" agreement with the owner of the property in 2007, according to court records, and diligently paid her monthly rent to the owner while caring for her elderly charges, who range in age from 86 to 97. The complaint said the owner did not use Ms. Arindaeng's money to pay the mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Arindaeng did not know the extent of the financial mess she was in until she and the elderly tenants she cared for received an eviction notice on March 18, 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to examining the questionable practices of some owners, I ran across at least one Web site that has found a market niche in these elder-care homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carehomesusa.com, which caters to those who want to buy, sell or trade such homes, suggests that many care facility foreclosures are linked to predatory lending. It poses the hypothetical situation of an owner called Bill, who is "in the red by $4,000 a month" as the result of an adjustable mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The site goes on to warn potential customers: "If you bought your facility in the last several years with 100 percent financing, interest only or even a negative amortization mortgage, and you locked yourself into a high interest rate with a prepayment penalty clause, more or less, you have the same trouble [sic] just as Bill does.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A short sale," it concludes, "might be a solution for you."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeffrey Lai, an administrator of carehomesusa.com, said in an interview that short sales - sales based on an agreement between an owner and his lender that allows a sale at a price below the outstanding loan amount - were becoming more popular.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Many buyers who purchased in the last three years are so under water," Mr. Lai said, "because of high mortgage payments, and property values haven't appreciated the way they thought, or they may have an adjustable mortgage that has come back to hurt them."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added, "We sell endless care homes all over the U.S. in Arkansas, Kansas and mainly California, and we have a database of thousands of interested buyers."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The question is whether residents and their relatives have any assurance that the new generation of proprietors will have - and perhaps will be required by law to have - more solid financial underpinnings than their predecessors.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BUYERS looking for a country house in the Hudson Valley or the Catskills in New York State have settled on a more modest ideal: between $200,000 and $250,000 for a home on a few acres, with a picturesque town not too far away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That's what I think of as the 'little black dress' of the second-home market,'' said David Knudsen, an agent with Catskills Buyers Agency in Sullivan County. ''During the peak of the market the price expectation for that house was probably around $300,000, plus or minus $25,000.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although sellers have not all lowered their list prices to meet buyers' expectations, brokers estimate that the price for the typical weekend retreat has dropped at least 20 percent since its peak in 2007. That has lured some city dwellers to take the plunge on a getaway home, even as economic worries, snowstorms and tighter lending standards provided a chilling backdrop for the real estate market this winter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some common themes emerge among people who have recently bought houses west of the Hudson River for less than $250,000. These shoppers are paying close attention to property taxes and heating costs, are not particularly interested in renovating and want a second home that is a manageable size. The ease of researching homes and price trends on the Internet has also given shoppers a clear idea about what they expect to pay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Buyers from the city are out in the market, but they want a great deal,'' Mr. Knudsen said of his clients from the New York City area. ''I think one of the big challenges we have right now is a wide gap between buyer expectations and seller expectations, unless there is some distress element on the seller side.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That distress element is often divorce, death or debt, but two years into a grim economy the motivating factor for a price reduction can also be time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kristine Petrik and Jodie Dawson, who live with their two children in Montclair, N.J., are negotiating on a four-bedroom farmhouse in Bethel, N.Y., that has been on the market for a year and a half. It was last listed for nearly 25 percent below the original asking price.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although buying a second home was more of a long-term plan, their financial adviser suggested they accelerate their timetable to take advantage of low prices and interest rates, so they started looking last fall and made an offer in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've been very pleasantly surprised,'' Ms. Dawson said. ''We didn't think we'd be able to afford anything that came with such amazing landscape and culture. It seemed like you could buy a piece of the country at any price point in all different areas.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Antonio Maciel and Marco Campello also had time on their side when they began thinking about buying a place to escape their crowded Manhattan apartment in 2007. But living with two young boys and Mr. Campello's mother, they had trouble finding a house that would satisfy everyone's priorities and tastes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I wanted a log cabin in the middle of the woods; Marco's mom wanted something that was newer construction,'' Mr. Maciel said. ''We needed a place that would feel like a country retreat but wasn't too isolated.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After a long search they closed in December on a four-bedroom house in Roscoe, N.Y., that had been on the market for more than two years. Although it is new construction, fewer houses were built nearby than the developer originally planned, preserving the country feel, and the price had been reduced nearly 25 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The more we looked, the more flexible we were in our price range, but also the more we saw prices coming down,'' Mr. Maciel said. ''We had expected prices to fall much more than they did, and maybe that's why it took us longer to buy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sullivan County, where both couples found their homes, tends to attract people who value acreage and affordability over the amenities offered in neighboring Ulster County's better-known towns, like Woodstock, Stone Ridge and Saugerties. Because Sullivan County is farther from New York City, its prices tend to be lower, though the county has more lakes than its neighbors, and waterfront properties can cost double or triple that $200,000 ideal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Delaware County, northwest of Sullivan and Ulster, is also on the more affordable end of the spectrum. Margaretville, Andes and Roxbury have become big second-home destinations in recent years, attracting people who want more land than they can afford closer to the city. Now weekenders willing to drive farther north and west to save money can find even better deals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our average price is somewhere around $200,000,'' said Eric Wedemeyer, president of Coldwell Banker Timberland Properties, which has several offices in Delaware County. ''Three or four years ago it was probably closer to $250,000.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kate Vasko and her husband, Lorenzo Radulescu, who live in Queens, bought a log home in Bovina Center, just north of Andes, last fall. The 900-square-foot house had been on the market for more than a year, so their offer -- less than $200,000 -- was accepted the day they submitted it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''For the same price we probably could've gotten more square footage, but this was brand new, and we just fell in love with the property,'' Ms. Vasko said. ''It's less developed than other areas.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even in Ulster County prices have fallen roughly 20 percent from their peak. However, in all of these counties, the official data mixes more modest primary homes with the types of country getaways city dwellers buy, which are generally more expensive. Those vacation homes have also been slower to sell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Harris Safier, owner of Westwood Metes &amp;Bounds Realty, said that although nearly the same number of homes sold in Ulster County in 2009 as in 2008, last year's numbers were shored up mostly by sales of primary homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The $300,000 to $500,000 price range, which is the bulk of our dual-residence market, is very, very quiet,'' Mr. Safier said, adding that buyers are looking more in the $250,000 to $300,000 range now.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Deborah Ramos of Brooklyn managed to find a two-bedroom log home near Woodstock for less than that. After watching her investments shrink, she decided to cash out and began looking for a weekend retreat in Ulster County in October, finally signing a contract in February. Although she is paying close to the seller's asking price, she saw dozens of homes and said she considered her choice a good deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In February I started to see properties in my price range that weren't in my price range a few months earlier,'' she said. ''I was trying to stay as close to $200,000 as I could, but if you went under that, the houses needed a lot of renovation.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike many buyers Zohar and Jenifer Swaine, who live in Teaneck, N.J., were not deterred by the prospect of doing some work. In December, after searching for two years and finding prices near Woodstock higher than their budget allowed, the couple bought a four-bedroom fixer-upper close to town for $240,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the house needs updating, its rustic charm includes a barn, a guest cabin and a three-seat outhouse, and Mr. Swaine has a gradual plan of attack in mind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Step 1 is to make the home livable,'' he said. ''Step 2 is to make a playground for our children. Step 3 is to build a little place to fish on the stream.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The way he and other buyers describe their new country retreats, it sounds as if the soft market, and some patience while searching, has offered the chance to fulfill a dream.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're glad that we held out for the house we really wanted,'' Mr. Swaine said. ''When you walk in, you just know.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Selling real estate can be quite an ordeal these days, but the Corcoran Gallery of Art has found a buyer for a large piece of property in a section of southwest Washington where construction has all but stalled in the economic downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Corcoran plans to sell the property, an abandoned school for which it once had its own development plans, to a partnership that includes the art collectors Don and Mera Rubell. The buyers are looking to build apartments and a luxury hotel with an in-house museum at the site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Rubells, who already own the Capitol Skyline Hotel across the street from the former Randall School, at the corner of I Street and Half Street SW, live in Miami and have a private museum there.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mera Rubell calls the prospect of building a satellite museum for their collection in Washington a dream.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is a story of urban renewal,'' she said. ''It's about having faith and allowing yourself to dare to imagine a future.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the dream is sure to face significant obstacles and questions as it is reviewed by several layers of district government. The City Council, the Zoning Commission and the Historic Preservation Review Board must all sign off on the plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new plan's timing, coming as the Corcoran is preparing an exhibition from the Rubells' art collection, has raised an eyebrow or two, though museum officials have said there is no connection between the two.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Corcoran's own blueprint for the property had included several gestures toward the neighborhood, like the inclusion of affordable housing units, a discussion that may be revisited.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And while the community is eager for something to happen at the school, which has been vacant for several years, some officials question the price the partnership is to pay, $6.5 million, which is just a quarter of what the district tax assessment says the property is worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My primary concern is that we get the fair value, because it was originally underpriced,'' said Tommy Wells, who represents the neighborhood on the council.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Wells, who said he was intrigued by the proposal, explained that the city sold the property to the Corcoran at a discount in 2006 because it liked the idea of having an art school at a site that had recently housed a homeless shelter and studio space for artists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The museum paid the city $6.2 million and had hoped to create a new home for its College of Art and Design and a nine-story apartment building. The plan fell apart when the residential real estate market declined, and the Corcoran's partner, Monument Realty, pulled out of the deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The old school sits near public housing complexes but also borders a redevelopment area, the Capitol Riverfront, where the federal and city governments have invested heavily. A new $693 million baseball stadium for the Washington Nationals opened there in 2008 as have several new luxury apartment buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But since the financial crisis several nearby major developments have stalled. Last July, for example, work stopped mid-construction on an office tower at 1015 Half Street, when the developer filed for bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Corcoran official said the museum had contacted 50 Washington developers about the school property and received just six offers. The Rubell partnership was the high bid.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Rubell and Marilyn Melkonian, the president of Telesis, the Rubells' partner in the project and a developer of mixed-income housing, said they do not think the district's $26 million assessment for the property reflected its true value today.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''At the moment it's just an unused old building that needs tremendous amount of investment to transform it into something usable,'' Ms. Rubell said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Washington is something of a new location for the Rubells, whose prescience in the worlds of contemporary art and real estate has helped establish them as players in both. Though they have owned three hotels in Miami, the Capitol Skyline is their only property in the district.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Rubells began collecting after they were married, in 1964, and in their early years Don, a doctor, and Mera, a Head Start teacher, set aside $25 a week from their modest incomes to buy art, they have said. Today their resources are more substantial. Two decades ago they inherited an interest in several New York hotels -- Morgan's, the Royalton, and the Paramount -- when Don's brother, Steve, of Studio 54 fame, died. Steve Rubell's partner, Ian Schrager, subsequently bought the family out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Rubells began investing in Miami real estate in the early 1990s. In 1994 they opened a museum in a 45,000-square-foot former Drug Enforcement Administration warehouse there. The museum mounts rotating exhibitions from the Rubell collection, many of which travel to museums around the country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A show from the collection called ''30 Americans,'' featuring works by 30 African-American artists, will be exhibited at several museums, including the Corcoran in the fall of 2011. The Rubells will be the curators.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Corcoran's director, Paul Greenhalgh, said the exhibition was ''100 percent separate'' from the real estate transaction and had been planned before the negotiations began.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Corcoran has struggled in recent years with its identity and fund-raising. A decade ago it had hoped to build a $170 million Frank Gehry addition to its home on 17th Street NW, near the White House. But it shelved the expansion, citing concerns over money. Now it is trying to sell the property next door to the museum, where the addition was to have been located.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is also selling the current home of its college in Georgetown and is looking for a long-term lease in the neighborhood of the museum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Rubells' Capitol Skyline hotel, once a Best Western, is now a popular three-star hotel where hipsters congregate on weekends around the pool. Ms. Rubell said the new hotel across the street would probably have 225 rooms and space for both commercial galleries and the museum, which would house exhibits from their collection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 20,000 square feet the planned museum would be roughly the size of the Museum of Modern Art's sculpture garden.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It will definitely be a new paradigm for a kind of hotel-museum community,'' Ms. Rubell said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Members of the community express a mix of opinions about the plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A council member who had supported the sale of the school to the Corcoran said he now regrets that decision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This was seen as opportunity for the Corcoran,'' Councilman Jim Graham said. ''The Corcoran talked about having classes there, workshops for artists.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At this point, he said, ''I'm very disappointed that we awarded this property to them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ron McBee, the chairman of a local neighborhood commission that will weigh in on the development plan, said he wanted the Rubells and Telesis to provide some community meeting space. But he said he sees a benefit in having a hotel and a contemporary-art museum in the neighborhood.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've been in their museum in Florida,'' he said. ''For a lot of people they may not look at it as art. It's very -- how would I phrase it? -- it's very postmodern. It's cutting-edge kind of things, which for me is kind of exciting.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Sobelsohn, the commission's secretary, said he would like to extract some commitments from the Rubells and from Telesis, like free admission to the museum for people in the neighborhood. But after several years of staring at a boarded-up building, he said, people are looking forward to any signs of progress.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Whatever the Rubells and Telesis are doing with the building,'' he said, ''is going to be an improvement over what's there now.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With some indicators pointing to a slight rebound in the moribund commercial real estate market in New York City, transfer taxes have emerged as a threat to the few deals now in the works.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The combined New York State and city transfer taxes, levied whenever a property changes hands, are 3.025 percent, among the highest in the country. In a rising market the taxes are seen as incidental, but when profit margins contract the tax looms larger, and lenders and borrowers are grappling with who will pay it, real estate brokers and lawyers said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Any time you have a problem mortgage, the transfer tax is a central issue of the discussion,'' said Benjamin F. Needell, a partner at the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp;Flom. ''Who pays it? How does it get paid? Is there a way to structure the deal so the tax doesn't get triggered? It certainly is complicating matters.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In comparison, Chicago has city and state transfer taxes that total just 1.2 percent, while in San Francisco the combined tax is 1.5 percent. One of the few cities with a higher transfer tax than New York is Philadelphia, at 4 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The transfer tax has been a boon to city coffers, and generated about $1.726 billion in 2007, the peak of the commercial market. Revenue has taken a nose dive as the economy weakened, with the tax expected to generate only $581 million this year, according to the city's Office of Management and Budget.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Depending on the type of transaction, the tax is calculated differently. In a traditional building sale, the tax is a percentage of the purchase price and is paid by the seller.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the case of troubled properties, if a borrower has no more funds and walks away from the building, handing over the deed to the lender in what is known as a deed in lieu of foreclosure, the transfer tax is calculated as a percentage of the value of the mortgage. Because the borrower has no ability to pay the tax, the responsibility to cover the cost usually lies with the lender.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When properties are underwater, or worth less than their mortgage, said Michele Randall, a director at Deloitte Tax, ''you end up paying the transfer tax on the mortgage amount, which could be much more than the value of the real property.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a foreclosure, the tax is based on the higher of either the fair market value or the value of the mortgage. In this situation a lender could be taxed twice: once when taking back the property from the borrower, and again if it then sells the property to a third party.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Transfer taxes figure prominently in the protracted battle over the troubled Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village apartment complex. <span class="companylink">Appaloosa Management</span>, one of the lenders, is suing in Federal Court to stop a foreclosure, saying among other reasons that it would result in transfer taxes of about $200 million. Appaloosa said the company that now controlled the complex, CW Capital Management, should have sought a bankruptcy, thus avoiding the transfer taxes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The case of Stuy Town is not unique,'' said R. Stuart Gross, an executive managing director for the real estate investment company Eastern Consolidated. ''It just involves huge numbers, which has garnered a lot of publicity.'' Mr. Gross said he was working on a similar case in which a lender was looking to foreclose on a distressed property and then resell it to a third-party buyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To avoid a double taxation, Mr. Gross is brokering a deal whereby the property would be handed directly from the borrower to the buyer, bypassing the lender.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As we move through the cycle in which financial institutions grapple with the disposition of their loan portfolios, minimizing transaction costs, including the transfer tax, is going to be critical to the process,'' Mr. Gross said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tax is also a factor in the sale of healthy buildings, said Woody Heller, an executive managing director at Studley, a real estate brokerage company. Mr. Heller said he was working with a client who was trying to sell a financially stable building in Manhattan, but because of the difficult environment its fair market value was only slightly higher than the value of the mortgage. This means that if the owner were to sell, he would pay back the mortgage and make a slim profit. But the transfer taxes on the sale would eat up a large part of those proceeds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One way to mitigate the tax bite is for the owner of a building to sell a 49 percent stake in the property rather than the entire building. This is because a transfer tax is only levied if a controlling stake -- more than 50 percent -- of a property changes hands. In this case, the owner would sell the minority stake now and then sell the remaining 51 percent once the market, and his profit margin, improves.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while transfer taxes are becoming more of a sticking point in this market, it is unlikely the commercial real estate market will get any relief.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've not heard any serious discussion about curtailing the transfer taxes, and in this fiscal environment I would say the chance is slim to none,'' said George Sweeting, the deputy director of the city's Independent Budget Office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Given that prospect, the industry is focusing on ways to avoid what it says has become an unwelcome stumbling block to a recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When the market was stronger, transfer taxes were just considered the cost of doing business,'' said Michael E. Lefkowitz, a partner with the law firm Rosenberg &amp;Estis. ''Today, with the market in so much turmoil, transfer taxes are something that has to be seriously considered and structured around in order to get any deals done.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The USA cable channel, in promoting series like ''Burn Notice,'' ''Psych'' and ''White Collar,'' proclaims, ''Characters welcome.'' That could be a motto for Madison Avenue, too, as more commercials feature recurring characters who can help spots stand out amid the clutter.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Examples of characters who emote 30 seconds at a time include the Postal Service employee extolling the virtues of Priority Mail flat-rate boxes (''If it fits, it ships''), the lonely Maytag repairman, the three amigos whose ardor for Kellogg's Raisin Bran Crunch and Raisin Bran Extra cereals gets them into comic predicaments and the over-enthusiastic pitchwoman for Orbit gum.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, Stanley Steemer, the company that cleans carpets, floors, furniture, air ducts and other things around the house, is joining the ranks of marketers that use commercial characters to peddle their wares. A humorous campaign now under way nationally introduces two employees -- known as technicians in company parlance -- who drive to service calls in the familiar Stanley Steemer yellow van.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One employee, played by David Theune, is chatty, recounting his experiences in the field to his co-worker, played by Ernie Macias, who silently takes it all in. The talkative technician is a bit of a know-it-all, but he is genuinely interested in imparting his wisdom to his colleague, who seems new on the job.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new characters are accompanied by a new version of the vintage Stanley Steemer jingle, ''Go 1-800-STEEMER,'' which now also touts the company's Web site (1-800-Steemer.com or).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new characters are appearing in television commercials, which are running in both 15-second and 30-second versions, as well as in video clips that can be watched on the Stanley Steemer channel on You Tube. Stanley Steemer spends an estimated $50 million to $60 million each year on advertising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The campaign is the first work from the new Stanley Steemer creative agency, <span class="companylink">Young &amp;Laramore</span> in Indianapolis, whose hiring was announced in February. It is a homecoming for the creative account, which <span class="companylink">Young &amp;Laramore</span> had handled from 2003 to 2005 before losing it to the Loomis Agency in Dallas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five years later, the assignment boomeranged back to <span class="companylink">Young &amp;Laramore</span>, which scrambled to come up with a new campaign in time for spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''<span class="companylink">Young &amp;Laramore</span> worked in a relatively short time frame,'' says Justin Bates, president at Stanley Steemer International in Dublin, Ohio.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We had a very good experience with <span class="companylink">Young &amp;Laramore</span>'' the first time around, he adds, ''and with everything that had gone on with the economy we realized it was very important to have the right creative going into 2010.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Typically, an economic downturn can benefit the carpet-cleaning business, Mr. Bates says, as people who are loath to buy new carpeting decide to clean their existing carpets.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But early last year, ''a lot of people stopped spending money altogether,'' he adds, which hurt the company's results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It wasn't our best year,'' Mr. Bates says of 2009, but there was hope for an upturn because carpets were ''still getting dirty.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The state of the housing market also affects Stanley Steemer, he adds, because when homes are moving carpets can get cleaned twice: Once when the owners prepare to sell and again by the buyers after they move in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new campaign was developed by <span class="companylink">Young &amp;Laramore</span> after discussions with some of the technicians who work in Indianapolis, Mr. Bates says, which reinforced a belief that ''to our customers, Stanley Steemer is two uniformed technicians who show up at their house in the yellow Stanley Steemer van and do a great job for them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our technicians, and our vans, are our brand,'' he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That approach helps differentiate Stanley Steemer, Mr. Bates says, because most of the work in the category is centered on testimonials or demonstrations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It seems like every carpet-cleaning company in the country has the shot with the wand,'' he adds, referring to a piece of equipment, next to a section of carpet that is ''clean on one side and dirty on the other.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By comparison, the new Stanley Steemer commercials offer ''a little bit of humor, a little bit of information and shots of the van,'' Mr. Bates says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you're fast-forwarding,'' he adds, laughing, describing TV viewers who use TiVo or DVRs to zip through commercials rather than watching them, ''you see two shots of the van, at least.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Viewers who do that, however, will miss out on some funny advertising as Mr. Theune, an improvisational comedian, and Mr. Macias give excellent performances that bring their parts to life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For instance, in one commercial, the van is driving along a street when the chatty technician, who is driving, stops when he sees a roll of stained carpeting discarded with the trash in front of a house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''No!'' he shouts, adding a plaintive, ''Why?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I could have saved this one,'' he says twice, shouting it the second time toward the house. The spot ends with him weeping.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a second commercial, the talkative technician is recalling ''those challenge jobs'' that ''keep me coming back for me,'' including one, shown in a flashback, with goats in a living room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Don't tell me about a dog,'' he says to his silent partner. ''Tell me about four dogs, an exploding crock pot. How 'bout a couple of free-ranging house chickens? Now that's what I call a day's work.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A third commercial presents the chatty technician conveying a pearl of wisdom to his colleague: ''You know, I always say, know the species, know the stain.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cut to them seated in a living room as a large beast walks about. ''See, based on size, lanolin-free coat and his ear shape,'' the talker says, ''I know it's an alpaca.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He contrasts that with someone else, presumably a rival carpet cleaner, who ''doesn't think and says, 'Hey, look, it's a llama,' '' and erroneously treats the mess as if it were llama stains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The intent is to represent the employees, when it comes to their jobs, as ''fanatics'' who have ''done it all,'' says Tom Denari, president at <span class="companylink">Young &amp;Laramore</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea that a technician would know that ''an alpaca is different than a llama,'' he adds, gives the campaign a way to humorously detail the distinctions between Stanley Steemer and its rivals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You don't want to get caught at a party'' with the talkative employee, Mr. Denari says, laughing, because his work is so important that ''it's all he'll ever talk about.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But if you have a carpet problem, you want this guy,'' he adds, ''because he'll get it right for you.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scripts for the commercials are ''based on loose reality,'' Mr. Denari says, derived from the information gathered during the time the agency employees spent in the field with the technicians.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Before they all go out for the day'' the technicians meet to discuss work situations, he adds, likening it to the trademark scene during episodes of the police series ''Hill Street Blues'' when the sergeant, played by Michael Conrad, ended his briefings with the words ''Let's be careful out there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to the three commercials about cleaning carpets, there are two others that are focused on other services provided by Stanley Steemer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one spot, for water removal, the technicians are in their van, on their way to deal with a flood -- or, as the chatty one puts it, ''All is know is we've got a floor in trouble.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cut to them inside a home, standing in the living room, looking at a large aquarium that has been shattered by a baseball bat. All around are drinking glasses and plastic containers with rescued fish inside, swimming around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neither technician says a word as their shoes make squishing sounds in the soaked carpet. These words appear on screen: ''24-hour water emergency service available.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a second spot, for air duct cleaning, the technicians are inside a home with surgical masks around their necks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I like to think of the duct system as the lungs of the house,'' the talkative one says to his quiet co-worker, and they are ''helping the house to breathe.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Now, I know I wouldn't say I'm a doctor,'' he adds, ''but I wouldn't say I'm not a doctor, either.'' The words ''$50 off air duct cleaning'' appear on screen as the commercial ends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The spots for the services other than carpet cleaning will be mixed in with those for carpet cleaning in different proportions in different markets, Mr. Bates says, to ''see what happens.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For example, in some markets as many as 30 percent of the commercials that run will be for air duct cleaning, he adds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 15-second versions of the spots will run nationally on broadcast networks and cable channels. The 30-second versions will run in local markets on broadcast stations and cable systems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stanley Steemer handles local media buying internally, Mr. Denari says, while national buying and planning are handled by Starcom in Chicago, part of the <span class="companylink">Starcom MediaVest Group</span> division of the <span class="companylink">Publicis Groupe</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the Stanley Steemer <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> channel, visitors can watch the commercials as well as extended versions of some and outtakes from others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are also plans for print advertisements and online ads, Mr. Denari says.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As much as the twin towers of the first World Trade Center became an international symbol of New York ascendant, the 232 acres inside the buildings undercut private landlords with cheap, subsidized space, took a decade to attract significant nongovernment tenants and were not financially successful until the 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The tentative agreement struck last month by ground zero's owner, the <span class="companylink">Port Authority of New York and New Jersey</span>, with the developer Larry A. Silverstein has some urban planners and real estate executives wondering whether New York is destined to repeat the past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The agreement negotiated by Christopher O. Ward, the authority's executive director, seeks to avoid oversaturating the market by providing for the construction of towers in phases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the development of Mr. Silverstein's three towers will require huge subsidies, tax breaks and government tenancies at a time when analysts are predicting that the downtown commercial vacancy rate could climb to a very unhealthy 18 percent by 2013. That is the year the first Silverstein tower and One World Trade Center, which the Port Authority is building, are scheduled to open. It could be ''deja vu all over again,'' said Robert L. Freedman, executive chairman of FirstService Williams Commercial Real Estate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, some planners, brokers and downtown advocates say that with Lower Manhattan evolving into a lively residential and commercial community, the district will need buildings with a mix of retail, apartments, hotels and offices, rather than the huge office towers planned for the trade center. Those towers, they say, are better suited for financial firms than for the kinds of companies now moving downtown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The growth in the city's economy has come from small and mid-sized firms,'' said Robert Yaro, president of the Regional Plan Association, an independent planning group. ''And the companies that have moved downtown in recent years tend to be smaller: business services, design, legal and engineering firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal agencies, state government and a single private tenant, Vantone, a Chinese real estate company, are expected to lease almost half of One World Trade Center, the $3 billion, 1,776-foot-tall building formerly known as the Freedom Tower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under pressure from the city and the speaker of the State Assembly, Sheldon Silver, the authority agreed in principle to $1 billion in financing for the first of Mr. Silverstein's towers, a building of 2.3 million square feet. The developer will also use tax-free bonds and insurance money. But so far, the only tenants are the authority and city agencies, for a combined 1.2 million square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Mr. Silverstein can raise $300 million and lease 400,000 square feet to corporate tenants, then the city, the state and the authority will provide up to $600 million in financial support for his second tower, which will be 2.5 million square feet. His third tower will wait until there is enough demand to justify construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The subsidies from the authority are about one-third to one-half of what Mr. Silverstein, who leased the complex from the authority six weeks before it was destroyed, originally sought. But the buildings would also be eligible for millions of dollars a year in rent rebates and reductions in commercial rent tax, which were quietly extended by the State Legislature last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg embraced the tentative agreement last month, saying it would accelerate the redevelopment of the downtown area. He noted that in the past five years, ''More than 200 firms in a wide range of industries have relocated to Lower Manhattan, taking 4.4 million square feet of space.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the mayor's numbers also indicate that the average lease was 22,000 square feet, a size more representative of small businesses than a 500,000-square-foot block of space that might be rented by a corporation or financial institution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On paper, the commercial market downtown looks better than nearly every other central business district in the country. But real estate brokers report that rents are still falling, because of the expectation that large blocks of vacant space will be coming on the market. <span class="companylink">Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation</span> will vacate about 600,000 square feet in 2012 at 55 Water Street, and <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> is already leaving 85 Broad Street and One New York Plaza, moving to a new headquarters across West Street from the trade center. AIG, the insurance giant, and <span class="companylink">Merrill Lynch</span> are shrinking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even Mr. Silverstein's tower at 7 World Trade Center, which opened in 2006, is still 20 percent vacant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Combined with the new towers, the brokerage <span class="companylink">Jones Lang LaSalle</span> estimates that the vacancy rate for first-class space could hit 18 percent by 2018.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Somebody's going to get crushed in the interim,'' said Barry M. Gosin, chief executive of another brokerage, Newmark <span class="companylink">Knight Frank</span>. ''The downtown market would be better served by having mixed-use buildings with a hotel, retail and a modicum of commercial space to support a 24/7 neighborhood. That would be far more attractive for new residents and workers.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Port Authority dedicated the original trade center, a 10-million-square-foot office complex, on April 4, 1973, in a heavy downpour that seemed only to emphasize that the city was in the grip of the worst downturn since the Depression. The stated purpose of the trade center was to provide a single home for international commerce, but it came at the very moment the shipping industry was in its death throes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Private landlords complained bitterly that the trade center, with its cheap space and low taxes, was undercutting their ability to attract tenants. Still, the complex was plagued by a high vacancy rate, and its biggest tenant was government: The authority, the United States Customs Service and more than 40 state agencies accounted for over 3.3 million square feet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trade center did not overcome its stigma as a government complex until 1985, when the authority signed a lease with its first major financial tenant, Dean Witter Financial Services, for 24 floors, at $31 per square foot, which was three times the rent paid by state agencies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It was a breakthrough,'' said Bertram F. French, vice chairman of Cushman &amp;Wakefield, who represented Dean Witter. The authority, he said, paid a price to get the firm, taking over Dean Witter's leases scattered at buildings across the city. ''Most developers wouldn't assume that kind of risk,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But occupancy fluctuated wildly at the trade center until the late 1990s, when corporations fleeing high Midtown rents moved to the trade center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the attack on the trade center, in December 2002, Mr. Bloomberg outlined his vision for downtown and warned against rushing to replace the 10 million square feet of office space. ''If we are honest with ourselves, we will recognize that the impact on our city was not all positive,'' he said of the trade center. ''The twin towers' voracious appetite for tenants weakened the entire downtown market.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Increasingly after 2006, however, Mr. Bloomberg argued in favor of completing construction at the trade center as quickly as possible. The mayor backed Mr. Silverstein's effort to get the Port Authority to finance his towers after the developer was unable to get tenants or financing for the projects. Reluctant to finance speculative office space again, the authority agreed to limit its subsidies and impose a number of conditions on construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''How can you build a building when there's no demand?'' said Donald Schnabel, a downtown broker who retired in January after 47 years in the business. ''I'm not convinced that downtown can absorb all the space.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article last Sunday about Mary Kay Gallagher, 90, a real estate broker who specializes in the Victorian Flatbush section of Brooklyn, misidentified the formerly WASP-only club that she joined half a century ago. It is the Knickerbocker Field Club, a tennis club in Ditmas Park, Brooklyn -- not the Knickerbocker Club, an all-male social club in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Sun Apr 18 2010</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By design, there is no ''For Sale'' sign staked outside the formidable 12-room colonial-style house at 225 Marlborough Road in Brooklyn's historic Prospect Park South neighborhood. The pale stucco home, built for the long haul in 1922 but lately a bit under the weather, is in need of someone to coddle it. But Mary Kay Gallagher, the woman charged with finding that someone, is not interested in drive-by gentrifiers who might be seduced by its location and curb appeal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Signs, Ms. Gallagher said, attract attention-wasting voyeurs, not serious buyers. She can discern the difference in a heartbeat. Psychology is a big part of the real estate game.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A sign is a sign of desperation,'' she said simply, definitively.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If Ms. Gallagher, who began referring to some sellers as greedy back in the Gordon Gekko-esque 1980s, cannot say it with authority, she does not say it. Every syllable is a declaration: ''I'm honest, and not everybody in this business is.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mary Kay Gallagher got into real estate as a kind of civic duty, to help find responsible guardians for the shingled, gabled and columned behemoths in her own backyard. Forty years later, at 90, having become wealthy by selling -- and reselling -- these homes on what used to be seen as the wrong side of Prospect Park, Ms. Gallagher still envisions the business that way. If the lovely but too often unloved landmark homes of Victorian Flatbush outlive her intact, she can die a happy woman.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not yet, though. She's busy making up for last year's comatose sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite her age and recent double knee-replacement surgery, Ms. Gallagher remains the heart, soul and boss of the boutique real estate firm that bears her name. She specializes in -- detractors say monopolizes -- the 2.5 square miles bordered by Prospect Park, Avenue H, Coney Island Avenue and Ocean Avenue, commonly called Ditmas Park (though it is actually 12 microneighborhoods, whose distinctive qualities she will happily expound upon). It is her turf, and she guards it with the bellicose vigilance of a junkyard dog. Julie Kestyn, a longtime competitor with her own eponymous firm, called her an icon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Mary Kay was the broker who, in the white-flight days when the neighborhoods all around Brooklyn were going down, helped keep this neighborhood good,'' said Ms. Kestyn, who is 66 and lives in Midwood. ''I get along with her, but there are people who don't. She's tough. I've been waiting for her to retire for the last 23 years, but why should she?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Gallagher -- grandmother of nine, great-grandmother of four -- works out of the barn-red, seven-bedroom house at 196 Marlborough that she and her husband bought for $29,500 in 1959. It is a privilege granted decades ago by the state licensing board after she lectured officials on why that made perfect sense: houses like hers on blocks like hers are what she markets, so why waste anybody's time in an anonymous office on some busy boulevard? She was instructed to post her broker's plaque in a front window, which is where it remains. She is coy about her commission, but insists it is lower than the going rate of 5 or 6 percent, and she says she always reduces it on sales above $1 million because ''enough is enough.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some say Ms. Gallagher saved this time capsule, composed of sprawling one-family homes, no two quite alike, from being chopped up into boarding houses or infiltrated by apartment buildings. Others say she unfairly steered minority buyers from the best properties. Ms. Gallagher, a nightly devotee of Bill O'Reilly, is no diplomat, and sure, her best friends (most of them dead) were white. And yes, she tends to grill prospective owners like a one-woman co-op board.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But I sell to blacks, to Asians, to Republicans; I sell to Jewish people, even though I would make a bad Jew because they have too many rules,'' Ms. Gallagher said. ''I don't think I'm racist. I don't say I'm such a good Catholic, either, but I know I'm not a bad one.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stucco at 225 Marlborough was the first house she ever sold, in 1970, for $59,000, to a doctor who wanted to walk to work from his own Victorian-style home down the block. He ripped out the kitchen, turned the elegant first floor into an office suite and the second into an in-law apartment. Forty years later, after his death, his family -- naturally -- retained Mary Kay Gallagher. Asking price: $890,000 (reduced to $850,000).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I want to sell it to someone who restores it back to a one-family home,'' she said after an open house that failed to net an offer. ''But what I want, I don't always get. Buyers these days don't want to do any renovating. Especially if both the husband and wife have jobs. Who has time to sit around waiting for the contractor? They want things to be perfect, even in an old house.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Gallagher, who grew up in the Philadelphia suburbs, one of five children of a leather salesman, got into real estate quite unintentionally at age 50. She was married with six children, that big house to keep up, and a hard-won tennis membership in the hitherto WASP-only Knickerbocker Club. But she was civic-minded. And the antithesis of a shrinking violet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As suburbia beckoned many of the middle-class white families that had populated the Flatbush area, the minority population surged to 20 percent in 1970 from 2 percent in 1960 (today, it is 58 percent black, 21 percent Hispanic and 6 percent Asian), and blockbusting by brokers wanting to repurpose the area became a viable threat. Once the so-called Old Guard moved out, what mattered to her was replacing them with owners who cared enough and could afford to maintain their properties and preserve the neighborhood's aesthetic. In 1970, Elliot Miller, then president of the Prospect Park South Civic Association, convinced Ms. Gallagher that she had the chops to recruit people like herself and her husband, Jack, who ran his family's funeral home business on nearby Church Avenue. He told her to regard it as a community service. She did, and does.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't sell houses, I show them,'' she said. ''I push, but I'm not pushy. I push up the neighborhood. I don't pull those real estate agent stunts. I live here. I care who moves in, because what happens to these houses matters to me.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She never imagined it would make her a millionaire. In 2004 she became the first to sell a home in Victorian Flatbush for seven figures -- a yellow palace on 17th Street that went for $1.17 million. Her most expensive listing ever was the Tara look-alike on Albemarle Road for $4.2 million in 2005 -- she said she was relieved when it failed to sell. ''It was a ridiculous price,'' she admitted. ''I knew people were saying, 'What's she been smoking?' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2007, her best year, her company grossed more than $1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Gallagher was one of the ringleaders pushing for Prospect Park South's landmark designation, which it gained in 1979, the first of five of the area's microneighborhoods to do so. Vinyl siding and bricked-over facades, along with the invasion of corporate real estate firms that delved deeper into Brooklyn in sync with rising property values, are the bane of her existence. When This Old House magazine ranked Ditmas Park among the top dozen places to buy an oldie in the United States, it seemed almost a tribute to her life's work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Corcoran and those other ones who come over here from Brooklyn Heights and Park Slope are a thorn in my side, but I still have the best houses,'' she said. ''Most people who want to buy or sell a house in this neighborhood know enough to come see me. I am a resource. No one knows this neighborhood like I do.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She is, as her granddaughter and heir apparent, Alexandra Reddish, observed, ''essentially a brand.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is her whole life,'' noted Ms. Reddish, 30. ''It's not just one big transaction.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A handful of young people eager to trade the convenience of brownstone Brooklyn for the space and grace of Victorian Flatbush were on the forlorn doorstep of 225 Marlborough by 1 p.m. on a recent Sunday for the open house. A few brought their checkbooks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Hello, I'm Mary Kay,'' Ms. Gallagher hollered into the expansive foyer. She wore an ancient cardigan, baggy corduroys and sensible shoes. On bad-knee days like this one, she is the downstairs docent while grandchildren act as tour guides of the upper floors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the original sale helped secure her a broker's license, she was never totally happy about it. Undoing the changes made by the doctor and restoring the home's original integrity will, she said, be daunting and expensive. ''Here, take a brochure and a map,'' she commanded all who walked in, generous with both handouts and opinions on the home's untapped potential. ''You're going to have to use your imagination on this first floor, but take down these Sheetrock walls, put in a kitchen, and look at the space you've got. Oak parquet. Original moldings. A fireplace!''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Heads nodded, and a bunch of imaginations proceeded to engage in renovation pipe dreams, apparently undaunted by the asking price or a backyard that cozies up to subway tracks. ''There is a little bit of noise from the back,'' she acknowledged. Later, she explained, ''I don't want to kill the sale, but you have to be honest with people about what they're getting into.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It reminded Ms. Gallagher of the young man who showed up with a magnet and a marble to see a century-old house: ''I don't remember what the magnet was for, but he told me he brought the marble to test the floors: if it rolled at all, it meant the house was flawed.'' Ms. Gallagher told the young man it was idiotic to think that houses don't settle a bit in 100 years. Occasionally it can be worth losing a buyer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2009, Ms. Gallagher's firm sold seven homes, the fewest of any year since she began. She has sold two so far in 2010 -- 694 East 17th Street, for $1.075 million; 1409 Glenwood Road for $925,000 -- plus a co-op apartment, and has contracts signed on two more houses and another apartment. The market, she said, is ''coming up.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first open house of the year, on Valentine's Day, was at 722 Argyle Road, a vacant spring-green Victorian-style home listed for $995,000. Ms. Gallagher stood guard in blue baseball cap, vintage camel's hair coat and beat-up leather gloves: the heat would not work, even for her.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But she plowed on, apologizing to visitors with an indignant shrug toward the balky boiler in the basement and extolling the virtues of the place: ''So much breathing room! And a turret!'' She got two offers that day and recently sent it into contract for $910,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her listings are posted on her handsome, modest Web site -- she says she created the first Brooklyn real estate site, in the late 1990s -- and elsewhere online. But she said she relied as much on word of mouth, which is how she found her own house half a century ago: by chatting up a local homeowner after becoming disenchanted with the (male) real estate agent showing her around. She maintains that men make lousy real estate brokers because they do not pay attention to their clients' wish lists, which in her case specified a driveway (she kept getting parking tickets in Prospect-Leffert Gardens), a serious front porch and closet space for a family of eight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Gallagher faithfully backs her blue 2005 Mercedes E320 into that driveway, a maneuver that inspires equal parts awe and incredulity among her neighbors, many of whom bought their homes from her.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We were wandering through the neighborhood checking out the houses and we ran into an elderly couple who asked if we were looking to buy a home,'' said Amy Glosser, who with her husband, Janno Lieber, bought a seven-bedroom home three doors down from Ms. Gallagher's in 2000. ''When we told them we were, they said, 'Then you must see Mary Kay Gallagher: she's the mayor of the neighborhood.'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Mary Kay is like old wine, full of contrasts; she's wonderfully direct and charming at the same time,'' added Ms. Glosser, a 44-year-old mother of three. ''But she was the only one selling houses here in the '70s and '80s, when people couldn't bail out fast enough. The old-timers all attribute the stability of this neighborhood to her.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inside Ms. Gallagher's home are two computers and two land lines. There are phones in every room -- yes, including the three and a half bathrooms. Ms. Gallagher gripes about being available 24/7 for ''Nervous Nellie'' buyers and sellers, but said that her only real regret about her career is that it forced her and her husband to give up Jets season tickets: she has always worked Sundays.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her concession to the chronological reality of being 90 is a motorized chair that whisks her upstairs. Her children insisted she have it installed after her knee replacements last year. For Christmas, she bought herself a 50-inch plasma television to watch sports.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The oldest thing in this house is me,'' she said, settling into a recliner (the house itself was built in 1903). ''I never used to tell people how old I was because I thought it might hurt the business. Nobody believes I'm 90, anyway.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She has lived here alone since her husband died of a heart attack in 2001, and said she would leave feet-first: ''You'd never get me into a condo, and anyway, my family would die if I ever sold this house.'' She estimates it could sell for $1.2 million -- the 1960s kitchen and baths could use some updating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Gallagher's first intended successor, her daughter Eileen Cullen, worked alongside her for 10 years before her death from breast cancer in 2005. ''We really worked well together, and after she died, I thought, 'Oh, this is it for the business; I can't handle it alone,' '' she said. ''But Alexandra picked it up right away; she'll be Mary Kay Gallagher Real Estate someday. Or she can call it whatever she wants.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Reddish said she did not plan a name change. ''In the first place, my grandmother is going to live forever. And in the second place, they didn't change the name Corcoran, did they?''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MUCH hope has been pinned on the recovery in home prices that began about a year ago. A long-lasting housing recovery might provide a balm to households, mortgage lenders and the entire United States economy. But will the recovery be sustained?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alas, the evidence is equivocal at best.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most obvious reason for hope is that, unlike stock prices, home prices tend to show a great deal of momentum. Correcting for seasonal effects, home prices as measured by the S.&amp;P./Case-Shiller 10-City Home Price Index increased each month from June 1995 to April 2006, then decreased almost every month to May 2009. Since then, they have risen through January, the latest month for which data is available.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, because home prices have been climbing of late, isn't it plausible that they'll keep doing so?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If only it were that simple.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Home price booms and busts do end, sometimes quite suddenly, as was the case for the boom of 1995 to 2006 and the bust of 2006 to 2009. Today, we need to worry about strong headwinds, as the government begins to withdraw its support of a still-troubled lending industry and as foreclosures are dumping millions of homes onto the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider some leading indicators. The National Association of Home Builders index of traffic of prospective home buyers measures the number of people who are just starting to think about buying. In the past, it has predicted market turning points: the index peaked in June 2005, 10 months before the 2006 peak in home prices, and bottomed in November 2008, six months before the 2009 bottom in prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The index's current signals are negative. After peaking again in September 2009, it has been falling steadily, suggesting that home prices may have reached another downward turning point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But why? Unfortunately, it is hard to pinpoint causes for a change in demand for housing. The factors clearly include government economic policy, like interest-rate changes and tax credits. But these moves don't line up neatly with major turning points in the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sociological processes may be driving these changes. Trends in news media coverage, for example, generate conversations in barbershops and hotel lobbies, which in turn alter the conventional wisdom about investing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider how that process might have worked during the run-up to the 2006 turning point in home prices. In May 2005, two months before the peak in the N.A.H.B. traffic index, Consumer Reports magazine had a cover article, ''Your Home: How to Protect Your Biggest Investment,'' that conveyed a very bullish sentiment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Despite years of dire warnings from some economists that the housing boom is about to end, it hasn't,'' the magazine said. ''Indeed, last year prices rose even more -- about 11 percent nationally.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The article went on to give advice: ''You can no more time the real estate market than you can the stock market,'' it said. ''If you need a house, and can afford one, go ahead and buy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The article extended to the housing market the conventional wisdom that then prevailed about the stock market -- namely, that it was quite efficient, without identifiable bubbles and bursts. According to this theory, there was an identifiable profit opportunity: buy and hold stocks, and by extension, housing, and watch your wealth grow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as 2005 continued, the conventional wisdom began to change.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some people in the United States were by then aware of the 2004-5 home price decline in Britain. Some were learning a new lexicon: ''housing bubble,'' ''housing crash'' and ''subprime mortgage.'' Newspapers and magazines began to include some derisive reviews of a March 2005 book by David Lereah, ''Are You Missing the Real Estate Boom?'' And accounts began to appear of the risky behavior of an army of real estate flippers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In May 2005, I included in the second edition of my book, ''Irrational Exuberance,'' a new data series of real United States home prices that I constructed, going back to 1890. I was amazed to discover that no one had published such a long-term series before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This data revealed that the home price boom was anomalous, by historical standards. It looked very much like a bubble, and a big one. The chart was reproduced many times in newspapers and magazines, starting with an article by David Leonhardt in The New York Times in August 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In short, a public case began to be built that we really were experiencing a housing bubble. By 2006 a variety of narratives, taken together, appear to have produced a different mind-set for many people -- creating a tipping point that stopped the growth in demand for homes in its tracks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE question now is whether a strong case has been built for a new bull market since the home-price turning point in May 2009. Though there is no way to be precise, I don't believe it has.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since that turning point, most public discourse on housing has not been about a new long-term view of the market. Instead, it focused initially on whether the recession was over and on the extraordinary measures the government was taking to support the housing market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now we're shifting into a new phase. The recession is generally viewed as being over, and those extraordinary measures are being lifted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On March 31, the Federal Reserve ended its program of buying more than $1 trillion of mortgage-backed securities, and the homebuyer tax credit expires on April 30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent polls show that economic forecasters are largely bullish about the housing market for the next year or two. But one wonders about the basis for such a positive forecast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Momentum may be on the forecasts' side. But until there is evidence that the fundamental thinking about housing has shifted in an optimistic direction, we cannot trust that momentum to continue.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SUNDAY after Sunday, a ritual is repeated throughout Manhattan and other parts of the city: Owner of a property for sale straightens up and clears out for a couple of hours. Broker comes in, tidies up some more. At scheduled time, the door opens and an urban apartment is transformed into the residential equivalent of a suburban mall, serious shoppers mingling with those who are just looking, all of them out enjoying a great American weekend activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As a ritual, the open house endures. As a sales tool, however, the open house is finding its relevance under attack at a time when ever-more-sophisticated online real estate sites tell buyers much of what they need to know. In a 2009 National Association of Realtors survey, 46 percent of homebuyers said they used open houses as a resource, but only 12 percent reported buying a property as the result of one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet in Manhattan's compact market, where buyers can sample the spectrum of properties for sale and still have time for Sunday brunch, open houses not only offer a flung-wide-open window onto how others live, but also remain a vital part of the home-buying experience.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pamela Liebman, the president and chief executive of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span> in New York, said about 20 percent of people who bought a home listed with her company initially saw it at an open house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For buyers and sellers, the open house is an awkward first date that could bloom into a more lasting relationship -- and a signed contract. Yet by many accounts, the perusal often leads to little but grief for sellers, who may return to find scuff marks on the wall, muddy carpets or even missing tableware.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Basking in the terrace sunlight at a recent open house on West 90th Street, one woman said she had been to more than 100 open houses over several months, though she loved her downtown rental with a river view. ''I feel like we're part of this legion of people who wander,'' she said. ''We walk in, look around. I've learned a lot about interior decorating.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked for her name, the woman recoiled. ''Oh, I wouldn't want anyone to know,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brokers accept the fact that many visitors are just looking. At the open house on West 90th Street, Ann Cutbill Lenane, an executive vice president of Prudential Douglas Elliman, greeted several people as if they were old neighborhood acquaintances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've seen some of these same people for years,'' Ms. Lenane said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was early afternoon, and about 60 people had turned out for Ms. Lenane's showing of a $1.395 million penthouse with three bedrooms and two outdoor spaces. Several visitors were building residents -- apparent to Ms. Lenane by their jacketless dress on a pleasant but breezy Sunday. A few others appeared to be open-house hobbyists.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Lenane doesn't mind catering to the curious and the covert. ''Listen,'' she said, ''if people have nothing better to do than wander in on a Sunday afternoon, I'm happy to entertain them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some buildings ban open houses altogether, allowing showings only by appointment, to avoid the specter of strangers roaming unattended. Some critics of open houses believe they are of little value beyond providing brokers with a means of soliciting new clients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, Ms. Lenane's first question to those who step into an apartment she is showing is ''Are you working with a broker?'' But she said that attracting business -- while it occasionally happens -- was not her primary goal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm a single mother,'' Ms. Lenane said. ''Would I rather be with my kids right now? Of course I would. But I work 48 out of 52 Sundays a year because I have to.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although an open house may not produce an offer, it can accelerate the process of lowering the price. ''When I'm able to tell a seller that 100 people were here to see their apartment and no one bid,'' Ms. Lenane said, ''it gives me more credibility.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That wasn't necessary with the penthouse, which after two open houses went into contract above the asking price, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many sellers are understandably nervous about opening up an apartment to the public. Word of theft or damage travels fast. In 2007, two women were arrested for posing as buyers at several high-end apartments from which they stole jewelry, a fur coat and other items.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Showing a two-bedroom apartment on West 74th Street, Madeleine Dale, an associate broker and senior vice president of Halstead Property, had to twist the owner's arm to hold open houses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I had to have two assistants with me at all times and cameras installed,'' Ms. Dale said. ''They didn't want children to touch their newborn's toys. Everyone had to take off their shoes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She sighed and added, ''It took a lot of effort.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, four months after the apartment went on the market the family moved out, and potential buyers no longer had to tiptoe around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Dale acknowledges that open houses don't always draw the totally sincere. ''There are perpetual lookers, nosey people, and they walk in like they own the place.'' But like Ms. Lenane, she welcomes everyone because, she said, ''you never know who they know.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes, the same person can be both browser and buyer. At Ms. Lenane's penthouse showing, Barbara Adler was out looking for her perfect space -- two bedrooms, outdoor space and views, a bathroom with light, priced just right and in need of remodeling to satiate her appetite for decorating.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I work at home, so I spend a lot of time in my apartment,'' said Ms. Adler, 66, the executive director of the Columbus Avenue Business Improvement District. She has given herself a year to house hunt while she rents on Broadway, and has seen approximately 50 apartments in about three months.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''She's been in every building on the Upper West Side,'' said her friend Ray Pennotti, while Ms. Adler laughed and admitted that she was not finding her search particularly enjoyable.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In fact, I find it anxiety-producing,'' she said. ''I always feel as if I'm running out of time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After 18 years in the business, Geri Epstein, an executive vice president of Bellmarc Realty, says she can tell which open house attendees are potential deal-makers from the questions that they ask. For example, serious shoppers want to know exact room dimensions and are curious about a building's financials and rules. Ms. Epstein estimates that about half the people who drop by open houses are the kind who might make an offer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yogi Trivedi is the motivated sort of buyer. Recently, accompanied by his broker, he crammed eight open houses into two hours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's the American dream, played out in front of you,'' Dr. Trivedi said at one of his stops, an open house conducted by Ms. Epstein for a $975,000 one-bedroom apartment with a home office on East 54th Street. Dr. Trivedi, 33, a physician who lives in Delaware, said he was a fan of ''House Hunters,'' the HGTV show in which buyers offer critiques of properties for sale.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he was not out to entertain himself; he had been looking for five months for an investment property.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Epstein was showing several apartments in the East 54th Street building. It was a gusty, rainy Sunday and traffic was slow. Much of the time she sat in the lobby, waiting and lamenting that the forecast had called for little more than a drizzle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By the time Ely and Barbara Blanco arrived at the building, they were on their seventh open house in two hours. The quest: a larger apartment than the one they bought several months ago after moving to Manhattan from Melville, N.Y. The Blancos, both accountants, said they enjoyed looking at homes belonging to others. But they also feel they are educating themselves about what for most people is their most significant investment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The open house gives you an opportunity to explore on your own and to really get a feel for the community,'' Mr. Blanco said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When they walked from East 54th Street to another open house at Park Avenue and 81st Street, Mrs. Blanco was reminded of how quickly life can change in Manhattan. They shared an elevator with a tenant who looked familiar and who might even have been famous.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''But it felt like a different world -- people there looked at us funny and didn't dress like us,'' Mrs. Blanco said, referring to the jeans and sneakers that she and her husband were wearing. ''Was it for us? No. But it was fun to look.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back on the Upper West Side, Sara and Jamie Garretson stopped on West 74th Street, at an open house for a $1.25 million two-bedroom that Ms. Lenane showed before the penthouse on West 90th. Having already accepted an offer on their much larger Central Park West apartment, the Garretsons were making a second visit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're downsizing, in major hunt mode,'' explained Mr. Garretson, an architect, who said he was in his late 60s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The couple had been to 15 open houses the previous weekend and had another 15 lined up. They wound up bidding successfully on the two-bedroom, but not until they had looked at the others on their list.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With the open house, you don't have to feel embarrassed or committed if it doesn't feel right,'' Mr. Garretson said. ''You can walk in and walk out. Then you stop in at <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span> or check out the flea market. You get some exercise.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With his wife nodding in agreement, he added: ''It's really interesting to see how people live. We might even keep doing it.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CoStar, which is based in Washington and has offices worldwide, has been a publicly traded company since 1998.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Judging by CoStar's stock price and revenue, business has been good, even in the downturn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A We probably saw 1,000 to 2,000 customers go away during the downturn. But in recent quarters we've actually been growing our net customer base. About 86,000 people are now using our system. And our renewal rate is approximately 90 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the market was going up, nobody had to analyze anything -- you just buy something, sell it later and make money. Now all of a sudden people are like, ''Oh, my gosh, we just lost our shirt!'' They are buying data they should have bought before.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Who are your clients?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Our clients include the who's who of commercial real estate. CoStar has about 20 products. You can buy different modules, for instance, if you're an appraiser or a broker. The average customer pays about $1,000 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q The cornerstone of CoStar's business is data. How do you continually track properties?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A We have about 800 researchers who specialize in geographies -- they're interviewing hundreds of thousands of players in the business constantly. And we have a fleet of Priuses that visit literally millions of properties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We're also in all the courthouses and read all the S.E.C. filings. But the root of it is the intelligent researcher who looks at all these threads of data and pulls together the story.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q How so?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A It's a connective process:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We learn about a listing and the broker volunteers pieces of information. We'll ask additional questions and keep checking back. We may learn a property has been leased, and we'll ask who leased it. We'll investigate the building that tenant came from, and then we look to see if there's space available there, and so on. The threads can go 10, 15, 20 deep before the trail stops.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Two years ago CoStar reached the million mark in listings. What's the number now?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A There are 1.4 million listings, which is a mind-boggling number. About 460,000 of the properties are for sale, a million for lease. Or, roughly $500 billion for sale and $500 billion for lease. More than 10 percent of this dollar value is in New York. The biggest categories are office leases, then probably industrial and retail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q How long do these listings stay on the market?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A In the United States over all it's about 400 days for a property to lease, with New York running at about 300 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anecdotally, we came up to New York to look at buildings eight months ago -- we are relocating our New York office -- and I came back up again recently to look again, and there appear to be roughly the same spaces available today that were available eight months ago.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Let's talk about numbers in the New York area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A We track around 140,000 buildings in the tristate area in our system. Right now we're running at about an 8 percent vacancy rate in the Manhattan office market. The retail market is about two percentage points lower.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rate is not so terrible, however rents have gone down. The average rent in a typical Class A office building in New York peaked above $70 a square foot, up from an average $50 in 2006. Now it's back at $50. At the peak, the vacancy rate got as low as 2 percent. The only other city to hit that level was San Francisco during the dot-com boom. San Francisco has never gotten back to those numbers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q Did you utilize your extensive resources in buying your new Washington headquarters, for $41 million in cash, from the Mortgage Bankers Association?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A I know that we analyzed it, and it's a good value. It's the lowest price paid for a Class A office building in Washington in a decade -- about $290 or so a square foot, including the land lease. We had probably a dozen Ph.D.'s working on the potential acquisition of the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q You started the company in your Princeton dorm in 1986. Did that help pay for school?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A I paid for a lot of my own education. You could make one amount of money washing dishes in the student cafeteria and you could make a different amount of money running discounted cash-flow analysis for commercial real estate on $30 million portfolios. So I was lucky. I got some summer jobs working in real estate, and it was the right time.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ROBERT A. MCCAFFREY, who has lived all of his 67 years in Garrison, across the Hudson River from the United States Military Academy at West Point, can recount stories of buyers who moved in, lured by the astonishing beauty of the area, and then within a year sold their homes and left for someplace closer to supermarkets and other suburban amenities.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is really the country,'' said Mr. McCaffrey, a real estate agent in the neighboring village of Cold Spring, ''and you have to be prepared for that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It seems Raymond Yun and Yuko Honda knew how to prepare themselves. The couple, who moved from Manhattan 18 months ago, at first rented an apartment in Cold Spring to test out the rigors and pleasures of country living. Dr. Yun, an emergency room physician, and Ms. Honda, a homemaker, then bought a three-bedroom two-bath ranch on four and a half acres for about $600,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They find Garrison ideal. ''We like the flavor of the country -- the privacy and the peace,'' Ms. Honda said. ''For us, it's just far enough away from everything but not too far.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fifty miles north of Manhattan, the hamlet is a 40-minute drive to White Plains, for shopping, and to Putnam Hospital Center in Carmel, where Dr. Yun works. By car or train, Midtown Manhattan is about 70 minutes away.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the roughly 4,000 residents -- used to hunkering down in front of their fireplaces in winter and kayaking and fishing in the river in the warmer months -- there is sometimes disagreement on what truly constitutes country living. Much of the contention, especially following a spring of heavy rains like this year, is generated by Garrison's 10 miles of dirt roads.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Howard Kaplowitz, a banker who commutes to Manhattan and is president of the 200-member Old Roads Society of Philipstown, sees a dirt road as something to treasure and protect. He is especially solicitous of the 6.6-mile stretch of the Old Albany Post Road in Garrison that is on the National Register of Historic Places.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dirt roads are emblematic of country living, said Mr. Kaplowitz, who has lived in his colonial home on the Old Albany Post Road for 11 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Because you can't go too fast on them,'' he said, ''you meet other people and wave and say 'Hi!' If it were a paved road, you would be speeding by and never have that dialogue. It's not like you have to have a long conversation, but it's a way of connecting.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From a purely pragmatic point of view, maintaining the roads is expensive and time-consuming, said Roger M. Chirico, Philipstown's superintendent of highways. It takes special equipment and materials to keep the dust down in the summer and to shore up sections that wash away in the rain. ''I know dirt roads are rural and they look nice, but they're not cost effective,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kaplowitz countered that some who ''don't have an appreciation'' for dirt roads say, ''It's the 21st century and we want a road we can drive on.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT YOU'LL FIND</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the 1,426 parcels are an acre or larger, and the hamlet has no subdivisions, said Brian J. Kenney, an assessor in Philipstown. In fact, a rezoning proposal being studied by the town could even increase minimum lot sizes, though it is not yet clear by how much. Lee Erickson, the president of Citizens of Philipstown, a grass-roots effort opposed to aspects of the proposal, said some of those in the group were concerned that they would not be able to subdivide at a future time and realize a profit on their land.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Half of Garrison is either publicly owned property or set aside as open space. One of the few areas of high density is Garrison Landing, the hamlet's hub near the <span class="companylink">Metro-North Railroad</span> station, which used to be a boat landing and loading point for farmers. It is home to historical structures, as well as the Garrison Art Center and the 80-seat Depot Theater, formerly a train station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Spectacular views of the river can be found most everywhere, but a favorite is from the first tee at the Garrison Golf Club and Inn on Route 9, above a point where the water snakes around the shoreline. On the opposite shore, the view of Garrison from West Point includes a vista of homes and swimming pools tucked into mountain ledges. Most of the houses -- new and older colonials and Victorians, some with horse paddocks -- sit back on dirt roads that weave through rocky, wooded terrain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For strip malls or supermarkets, residents must go elsewhere.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT YOU'LL PAY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 62 houses for sale at the end of March ranged in price from $199,000 for a three-bedroom one-bath ranch on a 0.16-acre lot to $6 million for a 10-bedroom house with 5 baths and a half bath, built in 1895 on 18 waterfront acres. In the middle, a four-bedroom colonial with four full baths and two half baths on 11 acres was listed at $1.699 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The median price of a single-family home at the end of March was $365,000, with houses on the market an average of 257 days, according to the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service. Last year, the single-family median was $402,500, and the average time on the market was 227 days. The top sale was $10.25 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five years ago the median was $548,500, the average time on market 205 days and the top sale $4.35 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the summers, residents like Bud and Claudine Struck, who moved to a 1910 farmhouse from Manhattan nine years ago, sometimes rent out their homes. The Strucks -- he is an aviation mechanic and she a real estate investor -- bought the farmhouse for about $400,000, renovated it and recently had it appraised by a bank for more than $1 million. They rent it for about $10,000 a month. ''It's called preservation of capital,'' Ms. Struck said. ''And we get to travel.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT TO DO</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John and Penny Seekircher, who have lived for 28 years in a four-bedroom farmhouse on three and a half acres overlooking the river, take full advantage of the opportunities for recreation and entertainment in the area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're big walkers,'' said Mr. Seekircher, who with his wife has a business restoring old steel windows. The couple often hike the local trails, some with redoubts used as lookouts during the Revolutionary War. There is also the 80-acre Manitoga Nature Center, which offers five miles of trails, including part of the Appalachian Trail.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. and Mrs. Seekircher, whose two children are grown, sometimes attend plays at the Depot Theater or drive to Cold Spring to dine at the Riverview Restaurant, a favorite with locals for its brick-oven pizza and seafood and for its views of the river and Storm King Mountain on the west bank.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boscobel Restoration, a 110-acre estate on a bluff overlooking the Hudson, hosts the Hudson Valley Shakespeare Festival each summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are no movie theaters in Philipstown; the nearest are in Fishkill or Cortlandt, a 15-minute drive, Mrs. Seekircher said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE SCHOOLS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Garrison Union Free School District, which owns a 181-acre forest for hiking and plant and wildlife education, has one public school through Grade 8 but not beyond. Of fourth graders last year, 100 percent met state standards on English and math tests, versus 77 percent and 87 percent statewide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After eighth grade, there is Haldane High School in Cold Spring or James I. O'Neill High School, a 15-minute bus ride away in Highland Falls across the river in Orange County. O'Neill also serves the children of faculty and staff members at West Point.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Haldane last year, 80 percent of the 90 graduates went on to four-year colleges and 17 percent to two-year colleges. The SAT averages were 526 in reading, 559 in math and 511 in writing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the 123 O'Neill graduates last year,61 percent entered four-year colleges and 25 percent went to two-year colleges. The average SAT scores for O'Neill students in 2009 were 547 in reading, 540 in math and 528 in writing, versus 480, 500 and 470 statewide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE COMMUTE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The train ride to Grand Central Terminal on the Metro-North Hudson Line takes about 70 minutes. Bought online, a round-trip ticket during peak times costs $28.50, a monthly ticket $323.40.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trip by car across the Bear Mountain Bridge, down the Palisades Interstate Parkway and across the George Washington Bridge to Midtown also takes about 70 minutes, depending on traffic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE HISTORY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Don H. MacDonald, the town's historian, the land that is now Philipstown, of which Garrison is a part, was bought from the Wappingers Confederation of Indians in 1691 by Lambert Dorlandt and Jan Sybrant, both Dutch. Six years later, they sold the property to Adolph Philipse, whose descendants lost the land because they sided with the British in the Revolution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHOTOS: ASPHALT-FREE: Dirt roads like this stretch of the Old Albany Post Road cause some contention.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BIRDS far outnumber people -- and almost everything else -- on Cedar Key in Florida. And residents of the island's city, who number under 1,000, prefer it that way. Sure, plenty of tourists find their way to the relatively remote locale, but their reasons for coming -- bird-watching, fresh clams, seafood restaurants, sports fishing and a gentler Florida -- do little to disrupt the laid-back vibe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even the city's well-attended seasonal festivals don't detract from the daily rhythm of clamming life and the extraordinary natural spectacle of birds like the elusive white pelican, roseate spoonbill and bald eagle, which make consistent appearances here. This is a place where residents often drive down the street in golf carts, not cars. And where spaghetti dinners and pancake breakfasts at the fire hall aren't just community events; they're how money is raised to help those in need. ''Folks here are fond of saying it's like Key West was 50 years ago,'' said Pam Oakley, a broker with Key Realty of Cedar Key. There are no high-rises, no franchises and no big resorts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although named for the Eastern Red Cedar that once grew here in abundance, Cedar Key, which is about 60 miles from Gainesville on a chain of islands in the Gulf of Mexico, is surrounded by marshlands and shoreline. Many second-home buyers are artists, writers, snowbirds or retirees from the Midwest and Northeast. But the city and its surrounding area are hardly overrun, thanks to several nearby aviary, wildlife and conservation areas.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only about 80 homes are on the market this month. Real estate brokers say that prices, which range from about $100,000 to $1 million, are now consistent with what properties were selling for back in 2002. At the low end, buyers can find condominiums and, closer to downtown, the small-frame ''cracker houses'' from the 1800s. Many of those, which were built close together before the advent of air-conditioners, have been restored as neighborhoods have been revitalized. At the high end of the market, custom-built houses on the water range from the $700,000s to just over $1 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This house is on a deep-water channel with two docks, one at the side of the house and another with a boatlift and room for three boats. The house, custom built in 1985, is in a private community called Rye Key. The house, which has water views from almost all rooms, sits on stilts and is 2,144 square feet. The great room has 14-foot clerestory ceilings, and there are large adjoining porches on two sides. The sunken kitchen has a wraparound counter that seats six and views of the waterway, marshes and oyster bars. Each of the four bedrooms has a private balcony. There are five bathrooms. Taxes: $4,828 a year. Fees: $42 a month. Broker: Pam Oakley, Key Realty of Cedar Key, (352) 543-0809; keyrealtyofcedarkey.com.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Low</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This 1,753-square-foot house, built in 1937, has been completely renovated and restored. It is one of a cluster of restored homes within walking distance of downtown. The ceiling was raised to create a loft, and the living area has exposed beams. The house has wood floors throughout. Both the kitchen and bathroom have been updated; there is one full bathroom and central air-conditioning. There is a wraparound porch that includes a screened-in sitting room. The house has a craft room, a laundry room and an outdoor shower. Taxes: $4,800 a year.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CHRISTINE FERRARA, a 39-year-old public affairs director for the Institute for Advanced Study, a research center in Princeton, N.J., has a passion for modern architecture and design. It began in 2008, when her husband, Steven Birnbaum, a technology consultant, bought her an airy modern home with floor-to-ceiling windows.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was to be her own little place, to decorate as she pleased without regard for his more traditional tastes or worrying that their three children might break something. ''I had seen the house on <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span> and thought it was too frivolous to buy for myself,'' she said. ''But he gave it to me for Christmas, probably not realizing what he would unleash.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since then, she has bought six more modern houses and filled them with appropriately modern furnishings -- streamlined upholstered sofas, leather loungers, molded plastic chairs, glass tables, Pop Art and steel lamps -- which she is constantly rearranging and staging for photographs worthy of the cover of Dwell or Architectural Digest. Except for one thing: the size of the rooms. An inch in Ms. Ferrara's modernist world is equivalent to a foot in the real world.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Ferrara, who posts the pictures on her blog, Call of the Small, is one of a growing number of devotees of miniature modern design. With their love of clean lines and sleek interiors, mini-modernists are unlike the vast majority of dollhouse hobbyists, who tend to favor more ornate Victorian and Tudor styles.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As recently as three years ago, an Internet search for ''miniature modern'' or ''mini modern'' would have yielded few, if any, results. But today there are a number of blogs like Ms. Ferrara's showcasing tiny modern interiors. There is also a Flickr group called Modern Miniatures, with 370 members -- many from the United States, but also from Australia, England, Germany and Japan. And an increasing number of manufacturers are producing mini-modern homes and furnishings for people to create fantasy spaces that, at full size, would be too impractical or expensive to own.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In real life, Ms. Ferrara lives in a typical suburban Colonial-style home, furnished with antiques she and her husband inherited, and various pieces from Pottery Barn and Ikea.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''With three kids, my house is fine, it's comfortable, it works,'' said Ms. Ferrara, who keeps her mini-modern houses and accessories in the basement. ''But with my mini houses, I get to be creative and take risks,'' like hanging bold geometric-patterned wallpaper in a sitting room or putting a white faux-fur rug on the floor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She can also buy miniature replicas of modern furniture she loves by designers like Le Corbusier or Charles Eames for less than $30 apiece -- a fraction of what the full-size versions would cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even so, she said, the little things are adding up, and she's had to cut back elsewhere: ''I don't buy clothes anymore.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Ferrara haunts Internet auction sites and online toy sellers for vintage and new mini-modern items made by companies like Reac in Japan and Elf Miniatures in England, as well as Minimodernistas, Brinca Dada and PRD Miniatures in the United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Particularly sought after by serious collectors is the Kaleidoscope House, designed by the artist Laurie Simmons and Peter Wheelright, an architect, in 2001. Back then, the colorful modernist dollhouse with its $250 price tag wasn't exactly a blockbuster. Indeed, the company that made it, Bozart Toys, went out of business two years later. But today, even a used and tattered Kaleidoscope House can sell for as much as $2,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Christy Schmidt, 30, a data analyst for an insurance company in Louisville, Ky., has two modern dollhouses -- one of them a Kaleidoscope -- that she writes about on the blog Petite Nouveau. And because ''the supply of modern miniatures is pretty limited,'' she said, ''I am quick to buy anything as soon as I find it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like other mini-modernists, Ms. Schmidt often resorts to making furnishings herself -- lamps out of beads, tables out of Lucite pillboxes and rugs out of place mats.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's my creative outlet,'' she said. ''It combines interior design and crafting.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To some, she acknowledged, it might seem like a childish pursuit, but ''it somehow seems warranted because it's cool midcentury modern.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mini-modern enthusiasts are usually quick to distance themselves from other adult dollhouse collectors, who have a reputation for being somewhat eccentric.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Annina Gunther, a graphic designer in Brighton, England, said that when she first started her collection, she ''worried about telling people, like they would look at me funny. But when they see it, they get it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Gunther, 28, has four dollhouses, which she stages for photographs that she posts on her blog, Miniatures by Annina, and on Flickr. The pictures are remarkably evocative and artistic: with rain boots and trash bags left by the door and notes taped to the mirror, the rooms have a lived-in quality and urban melancholy reminiscent of an Edward Hopper painting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I am not creating dream places,'' she said. ''I want to show the reality, the grit and the mess of living in the city.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others, however, are creating dream houses. Lee Downin, 56, designed window and floor displays for <span class="companylink">Crate &amp;Barrel</span> for 30 years, but is now caring for his elderly mother in Dallas. Someday, he said, he wants to live in a house made out of a cargo shipping container, but since he can't now, he had a miniature one custom built last year. He has decorated it with replicas of modern furniture like a Noguchi coffee table and a Mies van der Rohe Barcelona chair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''As life gets more complicated and cluttered, I am more and more attracted to the simplicity of modern design,'' said Mr. Downin, who is working on plans to add a tiny deck, pool and yard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even when the miniature house in question is not a model of a home they hope to live in one day, most mini-modernists describe their hobby as an absorbing pursuit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bebe Ventura, 70, a retired interior decorator in New York, has nine modern dollhouses as well as a miniature houseboat and Airstream trailer. ''You can lose yourself for hours in your miniature world,'' she said. ''Whatever care you have goes away.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, of course, there's the appeal of total control, said Megan Hornbecker, a Web designer and mother of two toddlers in Redwood City, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Everything is how I want it, my way, in my dollhouses,'' said Ms. Hornbecker, 35, who writes about her three modern dollhouses on the blog Dream Dollhouses. ''I can't have my real kitchen clean 24/7, but I can have my dollhouse kitchen clean 24/7.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Short List</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If you find yourself sitting at home, watching reruns of''Mad Men''and thinking, ''It's all so great looking. I just wish it were ... smaller,'' you are in luck. Several online retailers offer everything you need to create a mini-mod world, from dollhouses to sleek furniture. Prices range from a few dollars for some interior fixtures to several hundred for a whole house. Then again, even that amount of money is less than what one full-size piece of modern furniture would cost -- and why have just one thing when you can create an entire world?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BRINCA DADA (brincadada.com). Sells a $299 modern dollhouse made of glass, stone and wood with recessed LED lighting powered by solar panels; it will be available in June at stores like F. A. O.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Michelle Kaufmann, an architect, remembers leading Laura Bush, the first lady, on a personal tour of one of her prefabricated homes, pointing out its on-demand water heater and explaining how the graywater system recycled waste water. It was May 2006, and a full-scale model of Ms. Kaufmann's Glidehouse design had been erected at the National Building Museum in Washington. It was, Ms. Kaufmann said, one of the high points for her design-build company, mkDesigns.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were others. The company had its debut with a bang in 2004 when Sunset magazine chose to feature a model of the Glidehouse in its annual Celebration Weekend event in Menlo Park, Calif. An estimated 25,000 people -- builders, architects, potential clients -- waited in long lines that formed even before the doors opened to see mkDesigns' modern take on the prefab home. The overwhelming response jump-started the company, which until that point had been a one-woman operation. It seemed like the right idea at the right time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Kaufmann immediately hired a client-services manager to handle the hundreds of customer inquiries she began receiving and set to work building her business. ''There hadn't been a precedent for a green preconfigured home,'' Ms. Kaufmann said, ''and ours struck a chord.'' The firm, based in Oakland, Calif., rapidly earned a reputation for its streamlined modular homes and went on to build a total of 53, mostly on the West Coast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Kaufmann built more homes than any of the other dozen or so boutique prefab-home companies that have sprung up in the past decade. These include Resolution 4 Architecture in New York, LivingHomes and Marmol Radziner in Los Angeles, and FlatPak in Minneapolis. While most of the firms emphasized custom designs and high-end prices, mkDesigns aimed to reach a middle market with homes that cost $160 to $180 per square foot, not including the site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Together, the green prefab companies represent a tiny segment of the home construction market, but with their focus on sustainability and affordability, they offer the prospect of genuinely green homes delivered to a mass market -- an alternative to cookie-cutter spec houses and bloated McMansions. ''Before the economic meltdown, all builders were looking at prefab in one way or another,'' said Leo Marmol, founder of Marmol Radziner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason was the success of similar firms outside the United States. Of all the new single-family houses built in Finland last year, for example, 68 percent were wholly or partly prefabricated, and the home building company Sekisui builds approximately 15,000 modular housing units a year in Japan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Predictability is one attraction. Home parts are made in a controlled environment and assembled on site, often in a matter of days, meaning weather is less of an issue. And prefab buildings produce about 50 to 75 percent less waste than site-built homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Kaufmann's first challenge was to find factories that would produce the parts necessary to assemble her homes. ''Factories wanted high volume,'' she said. And some of them did not want to take on the liability of manufacturing green but untested features, like countertops made of recycled paper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even when Ms. Kaufmann found factories that would create what she wanted, the alliances didn't always last. ''We found a factory in Canada that worked well for a while,'' she said. ''But they got a big order to build workers' camps in Alaska and told us we would have to add six months to our project schedule, and they doubled the fee. Here we were in contract with a client -- it was not acceptable for us to pass that on to them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late 2006, Ms. Kaufmann decided she had no choice but to buy or build her own factory. With capital from one of mkDesigns's partners, the company bought a modular-home factory in Seattle that was rapidly reconfigured to put out 14 homes a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To run the factory, Ms. Kaufmann hired away a manager who had been in charge of laptop production and distribution for <span class="companylink">Hewlett-Packard</span> in Tokyo. This was in line with Ms. Kaufmann's vision of creating a hybrid company that straddled the line between architecture and product design. ''You could compare one of our homes to an iPod -- a really well-designed product that can be customized with different skins and applications,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having a manufacturing plant changed the game. ''It allowed us to design the elements we wanted and to grow,'' Ms. Kaufmann said. ''We were wearing two hats and the clients were getting a better product.'' The factory was so successful that within two years, it became apparent that the company needed another -- larger and more sophisticated. ''We didn't start off with the fanciest factory,'' Ms. Kaufmann said. ''We were in bootstrapping mode.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the height of its success, mkDesigns employed 60 people in the design studio and the factory. Ms. Kaufmann attracted a number of investors willing to put up $100 million to help buy half a dozen factories across the United States. In early 2008, before the economy turned, the firm found a plant in Sacramento that it thought would be perfect. Ms. Kaufmann decided to sell the Seattle plant but leased it back and kept production going.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the economy did turn, the mortgage collapse made it increasingly difficult for clients to obtain loans. With business declining and the housing climate increasingly uncertain, Ms. Kaufmann decided not to buy the Sacramento plant. ''We realized others could do the job much more cheaply than us,'' Ms. Kaufmann said. Things had changed. Factories that had previously been reluctant to risk manufacturing unfamiliar parts were now phoning Ms. Kaufmann, hungry for work and offering competitive bids.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But then, in quick succession, two factories she had chosen to work with went out of business. One had taken payment of $700,000 for two homes whose parts they had committed to produce, but mkDesigns had to finance the completion of both homes. The other factory left mkDesigns to finish work on homes whose parts were only partly delivered.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In hindsight, Ms. Kaufmann says she believes that one of her company's main issues was an inability to create economies of scale. She and her partners had hoped that over time, and as the volume of their output grew, they would create more production and time efficiencies and that their costs would fall. Other practitioners have had similar problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Volume is still one of our biggest challenges,'' said Todd Jerry, chief operating officer at Marmol Radziner Prefab. Ms. Kaufmann concedes, too, that she was sometimes overly optimistic about production expenses and priced her homes for less than they actually cost.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last May, she came to the painful realization that while the company might have been able to cope with one challenge, it could not handle all of its difficulties at once: the collapsing housing market, the closing of the two factories, the financial hits. ''We need to close,'' she told her staff, which had been pruned to 25.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was a difficult time. ''We had all invested so much of ourselves into the mission of making thoughtful, sustainable design accessible,'' Ms. Kaufmann said. ''Closing was heartbreaking.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last September, a fledgling prefab firm, Blu Homes of Boston, bought the rights to build mkDesigns' preconfigured home models. Bill Haney, co-founder of Blu Homes, said the company had technologies that would allow it to make the homes more affordable. So far, none have been built.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A full-scale model of one of Ms. Kaufmann's homes, an mkSolaire, continues to stand on the grounds of the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, a spot that had been occupied previously by only one other house, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. Erected in May 2008, Ms. Kaufmann's home features a solar-electric generation system and a living roof. Its purpose, according to the museum, is to ''show consumers what the future may bring.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An article in the Square Feet pages on Wednesday about the retrofitting of office buildings referred imprecisely to a project at 545 Madison Avenue. The savings realized by retrofitting the structure rather than demolishing it and rebuilding could be $50 to $100 a square foot. That range is not the cost of new construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Fri Apr 09 2010</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As commercial real estate development nearly comes to a halt in the economic downturn, some well-capitalized investors are focusing instead on sprucing up existing properties. The process has various names: retrofitting, renovating, repurposing, even repositioning. But the underlying idea is to wring out more value at a time when rents will not support new construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York, prominent buildings like the Empire State Building and 500 Fifth Avenue are being rehabilitated, while 475 Park Avenue South will get a $25 million renovation and face-lift led by the architect Cesar Pelli. Refurbishments have just been completed at 200 Fifth Avenue, the former International Toy Center, and 545 Madison Avenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While not all of these projects have a direct tie to the recession, many do, including one started by the Hampshire Real Estate Companies, a real estate firm in Morristown, N.J. The company plans to spend roughly $16 million upgrading a rather ordinary four-story suburban office building called Centra, at 186 Wood Avenue South in Iselin, N.J., near the Metropark train station.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The architect for the project, <span class="companylink">Kohn Pedersen Fox</span> Associates, which typically takes on projects like the 101-story Shanghai World Financial Center, envisions taking the building down to the steel and expanding the fourth floor to create an overhang supported by a treelike column. A causeway entrance will span a sunken garden that will open up the basement for office use.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Here's a small building that's going from about 75,000 square feet to 110,000 square feet, but with the redesign, it will have the presence of an iconic building that tenants can rent for a reasonable price in New Jersey,'' said A. Eugene Kohn, chairman of <span class="companylink">Kohn Pedersen Fox</span>. ''This is a really good example of repositioning a building.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Kohn said his architecture firm had completed designs for dozens of rehabilitation, renovation and expansion projects over the last three decades. The projects may range from simply redesigning the lobby and upgrading elevators to stripping a building down to the frame and replacing almost everything but the foundation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''All these projects are taking existing structures and enhancing them, allowing the owners to get much greater return on them,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While building owners may begin such projects any time it makes financial sense, they tend to predominate during recessions, Mr. Kohn said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''One of the first problems that developers face in a recession is the office rents you can get do not equal what it would cost to buy a site and build new,'' he said. ''In bad times, dealing with existing stock and upgrading it seems to make more sense.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, in recessions, tenancy in general is shrinking, leaving some buildings half-empty, especially older ones that may have lost tenants who took advantage of falling rents to trade up. Office buildings that are empty or half-empty can be good candidates for repositioning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of these buildings may be close to half their recent value, compared to where they were before the crash,'' Mr. Kohn said. ''If you can now buy an existing building for a great price, you can afford to upgrade it and get great rents, and you spend less than building new.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hampshire, which manages investment funds and is fully capitalized, is looking for such opportunities for its investors, said Todd M. Anderson, a principal with Hampshire. Its 19-acre site in Iselin, formerly owned by the <span class="companylink">Siemens Corporation</span>, was the perfect investment candidate as it had unused development rights, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to the retrofitting of Centra, which will open by the end of this year, Hampshire is also preparing to build three more office buildings -- which will total 535,000 square feet -- and two large parking garages at the site.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Anderson said that some developers might have decided to demolish the rather mundane office building and replace it, but that retrofitting made sense for several reasons. First, even taking it down to the steel was cheaper than tearing down and building anew.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A lot of people would say there's nothing you can do with it; it's a small building that's badly sited,'' Mr. Anderson said. ''But there is inherent value in the bricks and mortar. Estimates were potentially up to $5 million in savings on a construction basis utilizing the existing structure.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if the construction savings had been minimal, there were other reasons to save the building, Mr. Anderson said. If developers rebuilt, they would lose grandfathered zoning entitlements that were attached to the structure, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, repurposing has received a push from the ''green'' building sector, where renovation is obviously looked upon more favorably than building new.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The focus on sustainability in this business has become huge,'' Mr. Anderson said. ''So anything you can do to foster that effort is worthwhile and hopefully makes economic sense as well.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new Centra will be certified as either silver or gold by the United States Green Building Council, Mr. Kohn said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 545 Madison Avenue, near 55th Street, the owners invested $90 million in a gut rehabilitation and redesign led by the architecture firm Moed de Armas &amp;Shannon to transform a faded Class C building built in the mid-1950s into a Class A office tower attractive to tenants like hedge funds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the first time that LCOR, a real estate investment and development company, had done such an extensive rehabilitation project. When the company signed a 75-year ground lease at 545 Madison in 2006, the building's office rents averaged less than $30 a square foot; after the work, asking rents are $75 a square foot, said David A. Sigman, a senior vice president. LCOR has recently leased to five companies, including CS Tang, a hedge fund.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''No question about it, it's a more valuable property than it was the day we took it over,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LCOR saved the cost of building a new structure, which could have been $50 to $100 a square foot, and also avoided the delay of a demolition, which would have added a year to 18 months to the project. Though he described the project as a success, Mr. Sigman said he did not know if LCOR would repurpose more office buildings in the future. One reason 545 Madison Avenue was a good candidate was that all its office leases, which were timed to a ground lease, expired once LCOR leased the site in 2006, so the building was empty.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While buildings can be repurposed with existing tenants, those projects are typically much more expensive and risky, Mr. Kohn said. Tenants in the building must be shifted around to accommodate construction, which can only be done piecemeal and may create hazards.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Still, as long as the bones of the existing building are good, and if the basic structure is in reasonable shape, and the floor sizes are O.K., any building can be a candidate for repurposing,'' he said.</p>

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Sales of U.S. Homes Rose Significantly in February</span>
</div><div class="author">By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ </div><div>639 words</div><div>6 April 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The wobbly housing market showed a rare sign of strength in February: pending home sales were up significantly, a report released on Monday said, suggesting that Americans took advantage of a tax credit for home buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales rose 8.2 percent, the National Association of Realtors said. Analysts had expected sales to stay flat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists said the data released on Monday suggested that buyers were re-entering the market as the expiration deadline approached for a government tax credit. Qualified home buyers have until April 30 to take advantage of a tax credit of up to $8,000. The credit drove up sales rapidly in the fall, when it was originally set to expire, but it has been slow to propel the market this spring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the association, said the report ''may signal the early stages of a second surge of home sales.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We need a second surge to meaningfully draw down inventory and definitively stabilize home values,'' Mr. Yun said in a statement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An influx of foreclosed homes, which are often offered at bargain prices, has added another reason for prospective home buyers to enter the market. The agents' association said it expected the upward trend to continue in the March data.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report showed that sales rose even in areas hit hard by stormy weather. Sales climbed 9 percent in the Northeast and South, which were blanketed by snow in February. The data is based on signed contracts, which usually take one or two months to translate into final sales.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The jump in sales was a rare bit of good news for the housing market, which remains in a deep rut. Home prices have barely budged from extraordinarily low levels, sales are at record lows and foreclosures are rising as Americans fall behind on mortgage payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't think we're in for a further slump, but I think the recovery is going to be slow and painful,'' said Michael Carliner, a visiting fellow at Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies. ''The risk that the bottom is going to come even further out of the market is easing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sales will probably suffer when the tax credit expires in April. But as unemployment recedes and the broader recovery gains steam, economists believe sales will slowly pick up and move decisively higher in 2011.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Exactly how quickly overall economic conditions will improve remains unclear. On Monday, there were signs that the service sector, which includes most of the United States economy, was beginning to improve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management's report on the service sector rose to 55.4 in March from 53 in February -- its second consecutive monthly gain. Much of the momentum came from a surge in new orders and business activity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The recovery has been driven by sectors like manufacturing, which has consistently outpaced the rate of growth for the broader economy. But the institute's report released on Monday indicated that services were beginning to catch up, and that employment in the sector was strengthening. Consumer spending has risen modestly in recent months, translating into stronger earnings and a slight increase in hiring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the highest reading for the survey since May 2006, and it exceeded analysts' expectations. The employment barometer was short of the break-even point, signaling that the service sector was still losing jobs, even though employment had gradually improved.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Exports rose significantly as American companies tapped into fast-paced growth in places like China and Canada. The backlog of orders also increased, reaching the highest level since 2007, suggesting growth might be robust in the months ahead.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Edward L. Glaeser is an economics professor at Harvard.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the fifth month in a row, <span class="companylink">Standard &amp; Poor's</span> Case-Shiller Housing Price Index figures for January that came out last week showed essentially flat prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has been 10 months since prices stopped their free fall, and there is a lot to like in price stability -- not only relative to prices crashes but also relative to price booms.&nbsp;&nbsp; For years, many American homeowners had persuaded themselves that real housing prices should rise year in and year out, but there is no reason to either expect or hope for perpetual price gains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One reason that people may have come to expect consistent housing price appreciation is that houses are assets, like stocks, and stocks should, on average, appreciate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People who buy stocks are giving someone else the use of their money.&nbsp; The only way that deal persists is if investors get a decent return on their money, either in the form of hefty dividends or rising stock prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Houses are assets, too, but it's a mistake to expect them to offer a regular rise in price.&nbsp;&nbsp; Houses pay hefty dividends to their owners in the form of living space -- that's the real return on housing investment - and the basic economics of housing doesn't point to perpetual price growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some pundits look at the ratio between housing prices and income as if that should remain stable, which would mean that prices should at least rise with incomes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that doesn't make much more sense than expecting a constant ratio between income and either computer or car prices.&nbsp;&nbsp; Declining construction costs, and rising incomes, led the ratio of housing value to income to drop by 40 percent or more between 1980 and 2000 in places like Houston, Minneapolis and Phoenix.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like any other well-functioning industry, the construction industry experiences technological improvements and increased efficiency.&nbsp; In the computer industry, technology has meant that affordable laptops have computing power that would have been exorbitantly expensive in 1980.&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, no one ever buys a computer thinking that it would rise in value.&nbsp; The real cost of building a home declined by about 3 percent in both the 1980s and the 1990s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In principle, declining construction costs could also lead homes to become more affordable year after year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Declining construction costs have not always led to declining home prices because homes have two other crucial ingredients:&nbsp; land and permits.&nbsp;&nbsp; When those factors aren't scarce - and they aren't in much of America - then construction prices dominate and price should be expected to stay flat or fall.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, there are plenty of major metropolitan areas where real housing prices barely rose between 1980 and 2000.&nbsp; Even Census Self-Reported Home Values, which don't adjust for generally increasing housing quality, suggest that prices stayed flat between 1980 and 2000 for many of America's fastest growing cities, like Las Vegas and Miami.&nbsp;&nbsp; In expanding Houston, prices dropped dramatically.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are, however, a number of metropolitan areas - New York, San Jose, San Francisco, Boston - where prices have risen more steadily over time.&nbsp;&nbsp; Joseph Gyourko, Christopher Mayer and Todd Sinai have called such places "Superstar Cities."&nbsp; These areas have also, not coincidentally, maintained high housing prices despite the bust.&nbsp; According to recent data from the National Association of Realtors, San Francisco and San Jose remain the two most expensive metropolitan areas in the continental United States.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Places like Boston, New York, San Francisco and San Jose experienced exploding housing prices between 1980 and 2000 because they had both space-specific factors that increased housing demand and increasingly draconian limits on housing supply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Northeast and California, high demand was created by economic vitality, which in turn reflects that magic that results when smart people work together in close geographic areas.&nbsp; The California cities also benefited from their comfortable Mediterranean climate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High prices occur when rising demand collides with restricted supply of land and housing permits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Manhattan genuinely has little land.&nbsp; Albert Saiz has presented convincing evidence that the hilly topography and water in the San Francisco Bay region makes building difficult.&nbsp; Man-made limits on construction, like huge minimum lot sizes and vast preservation districts, have played an even more important role.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the long-run price growth in these areas is more anomaly than norm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cautious home buyer should reflect on the fact that few places have the two preconditions for booming prices: restricted supply and a durable anchor for robust demand.&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, even if supply is restricted in one area, the odds are that some other place has similar assets and a greater willingness to supply homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boston is a skilled metropolitan area and its restricted supply has led to high prices.&nbsp; But Atlanta is now a skilled metropolitan area as well, and its housing supply seems virtually unlimited.&nbsp; Why is it obvious that Boston can maintain a permanently higher price level than Atlanta?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">America is filled with empty land.&nbsp;&nbsp; We have a remarkable transportation network that enables people to commute vast distances.&nbsp; We have an efficient construction industry that, when unfettered, is capable of producing vast numbers of high quality, affordable units.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those are the fundamentals of the housing market.&nbsp;&nbsp; I wouldn't count on your home getting more valuable over time.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTION APPENDED</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because of an editing error, an article on Monday about a powerful earthquake that shook Southern California on Sunday afternoon misstated, in some editions, the distance between Yuma, Ariz., and the quake's epicenter just south of Mexicali, the capital of Baja California, Mexico. It is about 60 miles, not 1,600. And an accompanying map showed an incorrect location for Mexicali. It is on the United States border directly north of the earthquake's epicenter, not north and west of the epicenter. A corrected map can be found at nytimes.com/national.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CORRECTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES Thu Apr 08 2010</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LOS ANGELES -- A powerful earthquake southeast of Tijuana shook Southern California on Sunday afternoon, damaging buildings in northern Mexico and border cities in California and Arizona and rattling a seismically sophisticated population as far north as Los Angeles and Las Vegas as chandeliers swayed, homes shook and the earth seemed to slide under the feet of people emerging from Easter church services for well over a minute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 7.2-magnitude quake struck just after 3:30 p.m. local time, and was centered 16 miles southwest of Guadalupe Victoria in Baja California, Mexico, and about 110 miles southeast of Tijuana, said the United States Geological Survey.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carlton Hargrave, 64, was standing in the entryway of Family Style Buffet in Calexico, a California border town, when the quake hit. His restaurant, he said in a telephone interview, was ''almost completely destroyed.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We've got tables overturned, plates broken on the floor, the ceilings caved in,'' Mr. Hargrave said with a shaky voice over the sound of his feet crunching rubble and glass. ''It was big. I mean, it was major.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reports from the remote area in Mexico where the quake hit were slow in coming. But an earthquake of that size would probably cause major property damage near the epicenter, experts said. In northern Mexico, one person was reported to have been killed in a house collapse.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initial reports from the quake's epicenter near Mexicali, a large industrial city and the state capital of Baja California, did not speak of catastrophic damage, although photographs posted on Twitter and some news sites showed buildings with crumbled facades and food on supermarket shelves sent crashing to the floor. There were sporadic reports of fires, gas leaks and phone line damage, but none could be confirmed in the hours immediately following the quake.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Associated Press, citing the Baja California state civil protection director, Alfredo Escobedo, said a multistory parking structure collapsed at the Mexicali city hall but no one was injured.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In a 7.2, you are going to experience a lot of shaking,'' said Morgan Page, a geophysicist with the Geological Survey. ''So it would be surprising if there wasn't a lot of damage. Mexico does have many vulnerable structures.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Postings on Twitter told of people in shock in Mexico as well as in southern California.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People were outside crying because the beams looked like they were going to collapse and a wall cracked (along with various things falling) and the power went out in some parts,'' read one report from Calexico.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the United States, the shaking was particularly acute in San Diego, where it set off alarms and sent the San Diego fire department responding to several calls, The San Diego Union-Tribune reported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have some reports of scattered property damage,'' Sgt. Ramona Hastings of the San Diego Police Department said in a telephone interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a Sheraton hotel in downtown San Diego, the floor cracked opened and prevented the front doors from shutting. Officials ordered all guests and staff from the building, pending an inspection from structural engineers. Fire officials reported a water main break in front of a hospital and another water line break at a department store.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's scattered stuff all over the place,'' said Maurice Luque, a spokesman for the San Diego fire department. ''There's nothing colossal.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even for California residents who are veterans of previous and more punishing earthquakes, the temblor was impressive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''House was shaking. Pic fell off bookcase. Lasted about 30 seconds. Worst I've felt here since Northridge,'' Timothy Nash said in a Twitter message from San Diego.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Northridge earthquake of Jan. 17, 1994 -- a 6.7-magnitude temblor that was centered in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Reseda -- lasted for about 20 seconds but proved to be one of the most devastating natural disasters to hit the United States. There were 72 deaths attributed to the quake, and it caused an estimated $20 billion in damage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initial reports indicated that Sunday's earthquake, while bigger in magnitude, caused nowhere near the damage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While this earthquake exceeded the numerical magnitude of the 7.0 earthquake in Haiti earlier this year, the damage there was far greater because the epicenter was near the heavily populated capital city, Port-au-Prince.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Baja earthquake was the largest in a series that have taken place in the region that presages it, beginning with a 4.2 quake on March 31. It was followed by strong aftershocks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Los Angeles, homes slid from side to side for well over a minute, a nauseating and seemingly endless wave that could be felt from the beach to the Hollywood Hills. Power failures caused by the temblor were reported in Yuma, Ariz.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Emilio Magana, 39, a priest at St. Patrick's Roman Catholic Church in Calipatria, Calif., had just finished a morning of Easter services at different locations around rural Imperial County and was napping in his church in the middle of lettuce and carrot fields when the quake struck.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I awoke to my bed shaking and heard some pictures from the walls falling down,'' he said. ''My nerves were a little rattled because it was a long earthquake. It lasted almost 2 minutes. It was one very long one, then short temblors. I've never felt anything like it.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New Rates Could Slow Adoption of Solar | The proposed rate structure announced last week by <span class="companylink">Pacific Gas and Electric</span> would replace the current five tiers with three. Most customers' bills would rise, but those using the most electricity would see significant reductions, to about 30 cents per kilowatt hour from the current level of nearly 50 cents. The existing rates have been a boon to California's residential solar industry, but these incentives would be reduced under the new plan. P.G.&amp;E. has asked state regulators to rule on the proposal by year's end. If approved, the rates would go into effect in May 2011. David Hochschild, a vice president for external relations at Solaria, a solar manufacturer in Fremont, said, "You can't have one foot on the gas and one foot on the brake at the same time."

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Looking to the Future for the Nummi Site | The site of the <span class="companylink">New United Motor Manufacturing Inc</span>. plant that closed last week offers an enormous opportunity but also challenges for Fremont, The Oakland Tribune reported. With credit markets tight and commercial vacancy rates high, it will be more difficult for a single developer to take over. Still, the Nummi plant's 370 acres, located between two freeways and less than a mile from a BART station set to open in four years, represents prime real estate. "In 20 to 25 years, I envision that as Fremont's downtown," Councilwoman Anu Natarajan said. Scott Connelly, a project manager with San Jose-based developer Barry Swenson Builder, envisioned a landmark complex of offices and entertainment and retail venues on the site. And Major League Baseball is expected to rule on whether the Oakland A's can build a stadium there. But the extent of contamination on the site and the time and expense of remediation is unclear. [The Oakland Tribune]California Climate-Change Law Is Challenged | Among the victims of the financial downturn could be a law that was one of the a signature accomplishments of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger: AB32, the ground-breaking measure to control industrial and vehicular emissions linked to climate change. Led and underwritten by Valero and two other Texas oil companies, a coalition of business is supporting a ballot petition to delay the law until California's unemployment rate is cut by more than half, to 5 percent. The effort to postpone the first economy-wide cap on carbon emissions has the backing of Meg Whitman, the Republican gubernatorial candidate, who has pledged to suspend the law on her first day in office. Even Governor Schwarzenegger, who has staked his legacy on environmental issues, has begun urging air regulators to move slowly. But he has promised to fight the ballot initiative. [The Associated Press, The San Francisco Chronicle]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Record Spending Puts Whitman on Top | Meg Whitman's expenditure of $39 million on her campaign for governor has helped give her a 3-point lead over her Democratic rival, Jerry Brown, according to a Los Angeles Times/U.S.C. poll. Ms. Whitman, a Republican and former chief executive of <span class="companylink">eBay</span>, had support from 44 percent of those polled compared with 41 percent for Mr. Brown, the state attorney general and former governor. Mr. Brown did better among older respondents: He had a 48 percent favorable rating among those 45 and older but just a 24 percent favorable among those 18 to 29. Ms. Whitman was handily outpacing her rival for the Republican nomination, the state insurance commissioner, Steve Poizner; the two face off in a primary election in June. In the same primary, Republicans have three choices for the future opponent of Senator Barbara Boxer, a Democrat. Tom Campbell, a former congressman, had a slim lead over the onetime <span class="companylink">Hewlett-Packard</span> chief Carly Fiorina, 29 percent to 25 percent. Chuck DeVore, an Orange County assemblyman, had 9 percent. [The Los Angeles Times]</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Throw-Away Society Dumps Tons of Food | Discarded food represents a quarter of all waste tossed away by California households. While some waste is inevitable in all forms of business, food takes on added significance in a time of financial difficulty, experts say. Farmers, restaurants and supermarkets discard six million tons of edible food annually, according to California Watch and the University of South California's Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. Food represents more than 15 percent of all waste in California and the largest single source of waste, according to the California Integrated Waste Management Board. California Watch also found that retail grocery chains were more likely to throw away food than to donate it to distribution centers for fear that even food that had not yet reached its expiration date could sicken recipients. [California Watch, The San Francisco Chronicle]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nurses and Stanford Hospitals at Odds | The impasse over a contract that includes raises but sets new hurdles for nurses seeking promotions may be broken when the nurses vote on the issue. The old contract expired on Wednesday. After about 20 negotiation sessions, Stanford Hospital and the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital have issued their "last, best and final" offer to the Committee for Recognition of Nursing Achievements, a union representing about 2,700 nurses. The hospitals' proposed contract includes a 4 percent raise in the first year for all nurses and a $3,000 "ratification bonus" for each full-time nurse represented by the union if the hospital doesn't receive notice of a strike. But it also changes the requirements for nurses seeking to be promoted to the two highest ranks. [Palo Alto Online]</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sonoma Farmers Market Returns The summer season for the popular market resumes on Tuesday under its old management. It has expanded and will occupy not only its old location at the horseshoe in Sonoma Plaza, but also the area around and behind City Hall. This reopening comes after the City Council solicited bid from other potential managers; the market and its board had been accused of favoritism and aloofness from the local community. But other potential managers, including the Sonoma Community Center, did not step forward, leaving the city to choose between the existing management group, which promised changes, and a new group. The City Council chose the existing group.

The hangar, used as a storage area for evidence of old crime, has become home to cats that sleep, eat rats and mice, and relieve themselves around the evidence. Some of the evidence is in containers, some in the open. An assistant chief, Jeff Godown, who was put in charge of the lab last month, has ordered the place cleaned up and the cats removed.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. On Park Avenue at 42nd Street, one sees magnificent, huge terra-cotta full-length male figures on the facade of the building at the southeast corner. Although the ground-floor facade has been insensitively modernized, the rest of the facade is extraordinary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Can you give me any information about this grand edifice? ... Tim Gastineau, Manhattan</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. The Pershing Square Building, completed in 1923, is a sublime masterpiece of brick and terra cotta, all buff and yellow and brown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It takes its name from Pershing Square, one of the least-used addresses in New York. The section of 42nd Street directly in front of Grand Central was named that in December 1918, a month after the end of World War I, in honor of the commander of the American forces in France, John J. Pershing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The developer Henry Mandel, who later built London Terrace, put up the Pershing Square Building, designed by the architect John Sloan in the Romanesque style. The Atlantic Terra Cotta Company supplied material for the building, and in 1923 its journal noted that Mr. Sloan worked to create the look of a hand-made structure, saying the clay was ''purposely roughened for kiln burning to help out the rugged texture.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Sloan's decoration is sophisticated and easy to miss. The intricate, cross-set brickwork plays against sinuous guilloche patterns and cross-banded columns, with inner bands of leaf work and guilloche patterning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The helmeted figures along the fifth-floor level, are ''war angels,'' according to Richard Wilson Cameron, a designer and a founder of the Institute of Classical Architecture and Classical America. He says the caduceus held by one alludes to the caduceator, or peace commissioner, a term of Roman times. The figure also holds a cornucopia, suggesting the benefits of a prospective peace. At various locations the letter P is superimposed over a square form -- Pershing Square. The whole facade works together as a tawny tapestry of the art of clay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Long and Called Flat</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Q. My father, Leo Harrington, was born into a ''railroad flat'' in 1902 at 707 Columbus Avenue. What is a railroad flat?... Jean Harrington, Hopewell, N.J.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A. Your father's five-story building was put up on a 25-by-100 foot lot in 1887, with two apartments per floor, each running front to back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The origins of the evocative comparison of apartment plans to the layout of a railroad coach are muddy. It was not in common use in the 19th century, but it captures perfectly the long string of rooms usually found in small multiple dwellings. The 1863 tenement at 97 Orchard Street, now the Lower East Side Tenement Museum, had four three-room apartments on a floor, the rooms of necessity strung out in a line, with the kitchens and bedrooms lacking windows entirely.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A revised building law of 1879, under which 707 Columbus went up, was usually satisfied by the well-known dumbbell plan. In those, slot-like courtyards were cut along the side property lines of the building, lighting all the rooms. I cannot find plans for 707 Columbus, but land maps indicate that an 1891 building at 450 Amsterdam, near 82nd Street, was nearly identical.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plan there was an alternative to the dumbbell. There were two apartments per floor, tiny windowed airshafts for the middle rooms, and windows for the parlor at the front as well as for the kitchen and dining room at the rear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, pretty much any five-story walk-up is called a tenement. But your father's use of the term ''flat'' suggests a certain shading, generally indicating housing for the more prosperous, as does the layout of two apartments per floor. Four families per floor would have made the building a tenement, in the usage of the time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Your father's family probably would have bridled at the term tenement. However, after a sweeping revision of housing codes in 1901, both flats and tenements were lumped into the category ''old law tenement,'' as the term took on a more technical meaning, and was even applied to multiple dwellings on Fifth Avenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Railroad seems to have begun working as an adjective in the 20th century. For instance, The Times reported in 1915 that a woman had died in a fire in a ''railroad building'' at 514 West 169th Street, near Audubon Avenue. As the tenement reform movement spread, railroad became a near epithet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus an article in The Architectural Review in 1920, describing a particularly grim pre-1879 tenement at 1 Madison Street, identified it as being of the ''so-called railroad type,'' suggesting it was not yet part of the lingua franca.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ON certain afternoons in Country Club, a small waterfront neighborhood near the Throgs Neck peninsula in the Northeast Bronx, small groups of men congregate in kitchens for the beloved ritual of the sauce. After the tomatoes and the seasoning are wedded together, the mixture is poured into jars and wrapped in a blanket to cool -- an essential step on its way to the top of many a pasta dish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this neighborhood, thoughts of Prego or Ragu are akin to heresy. The same groups of guys who make the sauce often head up to nearby Pelham Bay Park for boccie contests. Here, a few empty boxes of grapes on a curb indicate that a neighbor may soon come by to share his latest vintage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They say, 'You've got to try this one -- this year, it's a little different,' '' said Marcia Anne Pavlica, a longtime Country Club resident and president of the local civic association. ''It just enforces the community feel,'' she added. In the 2000 census, 60.1 percent of residents in the neighborhood and surrounding area reported Italian ancestry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Country Club is a neighborhood which is often treated to the sight of mounted police officers clip-clopping through en route to their training facility in nearby Pelham Bay Park. Basketball hoops abound, as do jungle gyms and (of late) ''Easter Bunny: Stop Here!'' decorations. The area is filled with families, many of whom live within baby-sitting range of Grandma and Grandpa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We have many parts of Country Club where the mother will live here and the daughter will live six or seven blocks away,'' said Councilman James Vacca, who represents the area. ''People know each other for years.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The neighborhood has no subway station, and is more than 10 miles from Midtown Manhattan; remoteness has its charms but also its setbacks. Sidewalks are often intermittent, and one area still lacks sewers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frank Menillo, who has lived in the same house on Rawlins Avenue for more than 50 years, is fed up with the shoddy condition of nearby Lohengrin Place. Until recently, the street was not on city maps. It is in poor shape, with oversized potholes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've been after it for about four years, maybe longer,'' said Mr. Menillo, whose quest received some attention in the local news media and help from Councilman Vacca last fall. As of now, he said, ''They have not paved that street.'' But the councilman's office says paving will start in June.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT YOU'LL FIND</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A midmorning stroll through Country Club is one of nearly utter quiet, save for chirping birds and the occasional plane on its way to La Guardia Airport.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Decorations and statuary are out in force, from the large lions flanking one door on Baisley Avenue to a plaster likeness of Mike Piazza (in Mets uniform) on Country Club Road. Some streets are winding, others are straight; a few, like Parsifal Place and Valhalla Drive, are hints that the area's street planner may have been a Wagner enthusiast.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House styles are varied: little Tudoresque cottages; boxy midcentury town houses; larger homes on Stadium Avenue; and a collection of late-20th-century stucco houses called the Estates at Country Club Homeowners Association. There is one co-op, at Stadium and Layton Avenues, though nothing else tall is expected, given local zoning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We are not looking for more homes, although the developers would really love it,'' Ms. Pavlica said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to the 2000 census, the area including Country Club and Spencer Estates has a population of 8,489. Some of those people reside at Providence Rest, a long- and short-term care facility on Waterbury Avenue. Ms. Pavlica gave Country Club's borders as Interstate 95 to the west; Eastchester Bay to the east; Layton Avenue to the south; and Spencer Drive to the north.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a commercial area, consisting of a pizzeria, a small supermarket, a laundromat, a dry cleaner and a chiropractor, all on Layton Avenue. Many locals venture to nearby Spencer Estates, where a small commercial strip is home to Barino's, a popular Italian market. Otherwise, the stores of Bay Plaza Shopping Center near Co-op City are a short drive away; Westchester County shopping isn't much farther.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A subject of considerable concern these days is the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's recent vote to eliminate the Bx14 bus, which until now has been the only public transportation within Country Club. The M.T.A. voted in late March to cut 34 bus routes, though a compromise was reached to reroute the Bx8 bus through part of the neighborhood, where it will stop on its way to the Pelham Bay Park station on the 6 subway line.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We got half a loaf,'' said Mr. Vacca, who heads the City Council's transportation committee. ''They did consider our geographic isolation to a degree that made the cut a little more livable.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sewer issue, too, is on its way toward resolution. The streets in the southwest portion of the neighborhood that still lack them should see the start of work next year, Ms. Pavlica said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT YOU'LL PAY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate is taken seriously; brokers are invited to meet with the civic association to discuss their philosophy and marketing plans. When houses come on the market -- and there is often a fair number -- some do not appear on any real estate Web site. Instead, the word is passed quietly among friends and family.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are a lot of people who just want to give it to someone they know who also lives in the area,'' said Dorothy De Marco, an independent broker whose company is called Phoenix I.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But prices over all are down 20 percent from the highs of the last few years and show no indications of budging, Ms. De Marco said. Rosanna Robustelli, an agent with Kravitz Ann DeSantis Realtors, put the average for single-family homes in the mid-$400,000s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If a large house on the waterfront is listed, said Carol Sportello, an agent at Scovotti and Company, a Bronx real estate and insurance agency, it might be priced as high as $1.3 million. But over the last year, she said, houses sold at $400,000 to $700,000, with higher prices being paid for multifamily homes. For example, Ms. De Marco is listing a house on Agar Place with four bedrooms and two-and-a-half baths, on a 55-by-150-foot lot, for $689,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for rentals, there is a range -- given the mix of housing styles and the by-owner nature of many leases. One-bedrooms generally start around $1,000, two-bedrooms around $1,300.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT TO DO</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The vast open spaces of Pelham Bay Park, New York City's largest green space at 2,766 acres, begin just a few blocks away. Within the park are playgrounds, tennis courts, a dog run and a nature center. The park is also home to the Pelham Bay and Split Rock Golf Courses, both open to the public.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE SCHOOLS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some elementary students are zoned to attend the Senator John Calandra School, Public School 14, on Bruckner Boulevard, where 94.6 percent met standards in math and 79 percent in English in 2009. For middle school, some go to the Urban Institute of Mathematics, a few blocks southwest of the neighborhood on Hollywood Avenue. In 2009, 80.6 percent met standards in math, 76.9 percent in English.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Herbert H. Lehman High School on East Tremont Avenue, about a mile from Country Club, SAT averages in 2009 were 420 in reading, 439 in math and 411 in writing, versus 480, 500 and 470 statewide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Country Club is home to Villa Maria Academy, a Catholic school for prekindergarten to Grade 8. The school's orientation booklet lists annual tuition for a family's first child in kindergarten through eighth grade as $5,500.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE COMMUTE</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Residents can venture on foot to the Middletown Road or Buhre Avenue station on the6 subway line, but both are about a mile from certain points in the neighborhood. From there, Midtown is about 40 minutes away. There will soon be the rerouted No. 8 Bronx bus to the Pelham Bay Park station on the 6, the northernmost on the line, where connections to other buses are available. The BxM7A express bus stops along Bruckner Boulevard at Jarvis and Baisley Avenues in the mornings, taking commuters down Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. The BxM9 express bus stops along Layton Avenue. A one-way fare on either is $5.50; a seven-day unlimited Express Bus Plus MetroCard is $45.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE HISTORY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Country Club was once, indeed, a country club, or at least part of it was. The Country Club of Westchester occupied part of the area from 1881 until it burned down in 1922, an event during which ''fashionable women left dance hall and dining room to form bucket brigades'' to help fight the fire, according to an account in The New York Times. Parts of the land were owned by families like Lorillard Spencer's, whose estate was parceled into 1,200 lots and in 1922 sold at public auction.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CEILINGS that soar to 9, 10 or even 15 feet, a hallmark of the construction boom in the last decade, have managed to survive the recession even as home builders and buyers are moving toward smaller living spaces.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The reasons are simple, several developers and architects in New Jersey said: It costs less to build up than to build out. And the aesthetic impact of a little extra headroom -- a touch of grandeur, larger windows and more light -- continues to attract buyers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People are more cost-conscious these days,'' said Paul Schneier, the president of the New York/New Jersey division of <span class="companylink">Pulte Homes</span>. ''But they still prefer to have the additional space overhead, even if it costs somewhat more to purchase, and to heat and cool.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The heating and cooling costs have been somewhat mitigated, however, by new technologies and building materials, architects and builders say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Schneier said all three of Pulte's residential projects under construction in New Jersey -- a single-family house development in East Windsor, town house condominiums in Highland Park and a three-story condo in Garfield -- had been redesigned in midconstruction to introduce smaller units into the mix.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the company's ''nine-foot rule'' remains firmly in place, Mr. Schneier said. Pulte and its subsidiaries Centex and Del Webb provide ceilings at least that height on the first floor of every single-family house and in all condo apartments, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sterling Properties, meanwhile, is building condominiums in South Orange in which ceilings start at 9 feet, and reach 15 feet for top-floor lofts, said Rosanne Brooks, the company's marketing director.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We do not see people walking away from that desire for a dramatic look,'' Ms. Brooks said. ''If they are downsizing after having lived in a larger single-family home, or if they are first-time buyers who may have had to adjust their expectations in some way due to the economy, they still want the feel of a light and airy space.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With buyers' purchasing power and demand for new housing both down sharply -- there were just 7,000 new homes sold in New Jersey in 2009 compared with 13,000 the previous year -- builders are looking for ways to add amenities without increasing costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Certainly, everyone -- buyers, builders, everyone -- has had to reposition themselves given all that has happened, economically speaking,'' said Bill Feinberg, an architect and planner in Voorhees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Feinberg said that during the building boom as houses swelled to ''McMansion'' size, 9-foot ceilings became the standard, and ''10-foot ceilings often came into play'' in designs for more luxurious developments. Through the recession and the housing crisis, most developers have held the line at 9 feet, he said. Eight-feet ceilings had been the industry standard for many decades, he noted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Higher ceilings have maybe even more value today, though,'' Mr. Feinberg said. ''Even if a room is smaller, it feels more generous if the ceiling is elevated. You don't have to tell that to somebody who isn't an architect. It is obvious.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said his firm, Feinberg &amp;Associates, was working on revisions to plans for an age-restricted development in Barnegat Township in which the builders decided to add 15-foot ceilings in the ''great rooms'' of the single-family houses in the planned complex. Earlier plans had called for 9-foot ceilings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The extra heating and cooling costs to residents would not be significant, Mr. Feinberg said. ''With the high-efficiency heaters, thermal-pane windows and air-circulation systems you have today, it just doesn't cost that much to keep the temperature at an appropriate level in high-ceilinged spaces,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Johnny Cruz, an architect with Robert A. M. Stern in Manhattan who recently bought a condo at Canco Lofts in Jersey Citywith his wife, Lizza, said his heating bill had fallen by about half although the couple more than doubled their living space -- and also went to 14-foot-high ceilings from 11-foot ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We had a 500-square-foot place in downtown New York City, with a sleeping loft,'' of prewar vintage, Mr. Cruz said. ''Those old single-pane windows are really leaky.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At Canco, a development of converted industrial buildings in the former American Can Company complex, the windows are double-paned and have a reflective coating, Mr. Cruz said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After looking at properties for a year, the couple moved into their 1,233-square-foot one-bedroom in January, paying $440,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The ceilings and the really tall windows did it for me,'' he said. ''This place is just really, really charming, and other places with more normal dimensions felt flat and dull by comparison.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IT may be too early to announce a thaw of the mortgage market, but some early signs have emerged, at least in one important category: jumbo loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mortgage industry executives say conditions are improving for those borrowing more than $729,750, the threshold for jumbo mortgages in the tristate region. Not only is it starting to get easier to qualify for these loans, they say, but rates are also coming down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate brokers are hopeful. ''I'm cautiously optimistic,'' said Dottie Herman, the chief executive of Prudential Douglas Elliman. While Ms. Herman has not yet seen the effects of an improved jumbo-lending environment on overall property sales, ''as credit loosens up, it will help that higher-end market move up,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Frederick Wohlfarth, the president of Wohlfarth &amp;Associates, a real estate broker in Manhattan, said he has already seen a 40 percent rise in sales requiring jumbo loans over last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, Prudential's mortgage affiliate, DE Capital Mortgage, has had a spike in activity in jumbo loans over the last few months, according to Jan William Scheck, a branch manager. ''So we'll only start to see these transactions close in the next couple of weeks,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Adamo, the chief executive of the Luxury Mortgage Corporation, a broker and banker in Stamford, Conn., said his company was offering jumbo loans on behalf of more lenders now than late last year. ''It's an indicator that the high end of the market is beginning to recover,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On jumbo loans Luxury Mortgage makes directly, he said, the most highly qualified borrowers can secure a 4.5 percent adjustable-rate mortgage, which is about half of a percentage point lower than the prevailing rate late last year. (The average rate for a 30-year fixed jumbo loan is 5.125 percent.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These borrowers can also obtain that loan with a 20 percent down payment -- or refinance as long as they maintain 20 percent equity in the home -- compared with a 30 percent down payment needed at the end of 2009.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One element of the mortgage equation has not changed as sharply: borrowers must still have excellent credit to qualify for the loans. And that means credit scores of at least 700, along with enough cash in the bank to cover at least six months of payments, according to Mr. Adamo. On bigger loans of $1.5 million or more, borrowers will need a credit score of at least 740 to secure the best rates, industry experts say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alan Rosenbaum, the chief executive of the Guardhill Financial Corporation, a Manhattan mortgage broker, said, ''Lenders are still focused on credit scores, but they're actually analyzing the full picture now rather than just relying on computer-generated credit scores.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rosenbaum said he had also seen a relaxation in lending standards compared with a year ago. ''And we have witnessed more lenders appearing recently, as they should,'' he said. ''A jumbo loan is one of the safest loans if standard underwriting guidelines are adhered to.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This bit of good news for high-end borrowers is in lockstep with the improving risk profile for borrowers in general, said Dennis R. Capozza, a principal of University Financial Associates in Ann Arbor, Mich.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Capozza, who is also a finance professor at the University of Michigan, compiles an index that gauges the default risk for borrowers in every ZIP code in the nation. The latest index, which Dr. Capozza released in March, reached 158, less than half its peak of 330 in early 2007.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So a typical loan taken out today is less than half as likely to end up in default as one taken out in early 2007. Dr. Capozza said that shift should translate to improving loan terms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the greater New York area, loans made in Connecticut pose the lowest risk, Dr. Capozza said, scoring a 146 on the index, compared with 225 in New Jersey and 206 in New York State.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York City, meanwhile, scored 410, which is down from a peak of 540 in 2007. In an era where some regions scored higher than 1,000, Dr. Capozza said New York City's current figure was not alarming. But with its ''overpriced real estate, falling house prices, high unemployment'' and other factors, he said, ''it is not a good time to be a mortgage lender in New York City.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Capozza said jumbo borrowers could be the first to recognize improvements in the overall mortgage market, partly because they have not had the benefits of a government-subsidized mortgage market, which include historically low rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Adamo of Luxury Mortgage said the city's economic picture did not necessarily suggest more lending risk. But because of Manhattan's high concentration of co-ops and condominiums, borrowers are more likely to face higher interest rates. Buyers in co-ops or condominiums less than 70 percent sold, he said, will often face rates three-quarters of a percentage point higher than those seeking loans in more fully occupied buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some lenders, too, may not offer a loan on a condo or co-op apartment unless the development sets aside 10 percent of its annual reserves for building improvements, added Mr. Scheck of DE Capital Mortgage, a practice he called uncommon in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In some situations,'' Mr. Scheck said, ''it's about having conversations with the board to try to meet those guidelines.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Millburn, N.J.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LIKE missionaries of yore, Rabbi Mendel Bogomilsky set out 20 years ago to establish a foothold for his faith in a wilderness of sorts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rabbi Bogomilsky is one of 4,000 emissaries of the Brooklyn-based Lubavitch Hasidic group, which has been setting up outposts across the globe to encourage more engaged Jewish observance. He put down stakes in Millburn, N.J., a genteel township with Reform temples and Conservative synagogues but no Orthodox house of worship.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''My continued motivation is the blessing I got from the rebbe,'' he said, speaking of the group's grand rabbi, Menachem Mendel Schneerson, who died in 1994. ''We are supposed to give of ourselves despite having lots of hard times or political opposition.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Millburn, the rabbi has conducted services out of two homes he owns, sometimes drawing 30 to 40 worshipers on the Sabbath and 150 on the High Holy Days, but also prompting repeated protests that he was disrupting his neighborhood's suburban tranquillity. Now he wants to build a synagogue, and he has encountered strong resistance from Jewish and Gentile neighbors over his application for zoning variances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unrolling architectural sketches for a visitor, Rabbi Bogomilsky said he wanted to tear down his family's home on Jefferson Avenue and a house next door that was donated by a supporter. He wants to replace them with a 16,000-square-foot, 144-seat Dutch colonial-style synagogue and social center, as well as a parking site for 50 cars. Since the two plots together total 1.8 acres, he needs a variance from the zoning board because the code requires houses of worship to be set on three or more acres.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than 100 neighbors have banded together to block his request, calling themselves the Concerned Neighborhood Association of Millburn Township. They argue that the town's leafy character would be violated by shoehorning an institution into this residential enclave.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Welch, a retired Nabisco executive who lives next to the rabbi's Jefferson Avenue home, said that he was bothered by periodic celebrations and fleets of parked cars, but that those annoyances were minor compared with the central issue -- that a synagogue on so small a plot could open the door for day care centers or shelters to do the same.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It won't just be houses of worship,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a town of bankers, lawyers and doctors, where the rabbi estimates that one-third of the 20,000 residents are Jewish, some accuse his critics of being anti-Orthodox and not wanting to see their staid town transformed by lively prayer gatherings. But the critics say it is purely a question of zoning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'm Jewish and have lived here for 35 years,'' said Michael Becker, a communications consultant for the neighborhood association. ''There's nothing about this organization that has anything to do with anything except rules.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At a meeting in February, a critic of the proposed synagogue pointed out that he had lost relatives in the Holocaust and that his sister was an Orthodox Israeli.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why, the opponents ask, could the rabbi not find a legal three-acre lot? Kevin Coakley, a lawyer for the neighborhood association, said that New Jersey case law upheld the right to host prayer services in a home, but that at some point the number of worshipers and their cars disrupt a neighborhood's calm.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rabbi, who said it would cost $6.25 million to get his synagogue up and running, including construction and acquisition costs, contends the town has gone to absurd lengths, including police surveillance, to stop him from hosting services at his homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, the town sued to stop the services, saying that Rabbi Bogomilsky had surreptitiously transformed his dwelling into a worship center, complete with a separate balcony for women. A state judge urged the parties to settle the matter, and they did, with the town forgiving almost $500,000 in fines and the rabbi agreeing to seek a variance for an actual synagogue. But now that he has, his neighbors are up in arms, upset at the scale of the building he has proposed: It would house four classrooms; a mikvah, or ritual bath; and offices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rabbi, a cheerful man of 44 with a broad salt-and-pepper beard and a family of seven children, said the building would be screened by trees and buffered from neighbors. He also said he had no intention of buying a three-acre lot in a residential zone -- the only place the town allows houses of worship. Three of the five lots that are available are occupied, he said, and the two that are for sale are more expensive than the site he has chosen. Were he to buy one of those two, he added, he would still draw complaints.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the rabbi does not accuse his neighbors of malice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I think it's more Nimby,'' he said. ''I can understand neighbors being afraid their neighborhood is going to change. What I can't understand is why they haven't found out what our plan is.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The rabbi's father was also a Lubavitch rabbi on a mission. He was sent to Newark to preserve Jewish life there after Jews began leaving for the suburbs. The father led one of the last synagogues in Newark, a city where there had once been more than 40.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As for the son, he bought his other house, on Millburn Avenue, in 1992, holding services there and displaying a 13-foot menorah that lingered long past Hanukkah. In time, he opened a store for Jewish religious articles near the town's center and a ritual bath in his basement, and began a Hebrew school program in the local high school. But he longed for a formal synagogue, and bought the house on Jefferson Avenue in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rabbi Bogomilsky's neighbors are determined that he not realize his wish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They've busted zoning if he succeeds,'' Mr. Becker said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARIA BERMAN was hopelessly smitten with the working fireplace in her first New York apartment, a third-floor walk-up in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That fireplace was in use most of the year,'' said Ms. Berman, an architect who lived in the apartment in the early 1990s. ''For three years I had quarter cords of wood delivered to my doorstep.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in 2002, when she moved with a fellow architect named Bradley Horn to an 1898 town house in the Sugar Hill Historic District of Harlem, she gave her heart to another fireplace, one that sat buried in the wall in the front parlor and hadn't worked for seven decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Berman didn't care. She discovered a creamy cast-stone mantel at a showroom closeout sale, surrounded the hearth with a toasty slab of Breccia Imperiale marble, and never looked back.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't miss the fire,'' Ms. Berman said. ''And I love the look of the surround. It really anchors a room and give it focus.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it comes to the attractions of a particular house or apartment, there's little mystery as to why space-starved New Yorkers are drawn to generous square footage, high ceilings and jaw-dropping views.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But over time, residents find less-obvious design elements unexpectedly alluring, not only faux fireplaces but also weirdly shaped alcoves, decommissioned dumbwaiters, Juliet balconies, claw-foot bathtubs, minuscule shelves carved into staircases, transoms atop doors, brass keyholes and vintage radiators. The list includes even more unlikely details, among them servants' buttons, speaking tubes, original metal thermostats and shaving closets. (Most people don't even know what a shaving closet is: a shallow alcove with a sink just large enough for a man to trim his whiskers.)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These mundane grace notes, which may seem to have little purpose beyond collecting dust, are sometimes the very things residents single out to explain why they are drawn to a particular space. On occasion, these homely accents even prove to be the selling point when it comes to closing a deal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I once had a client who said they decided to buy because of the servants' call buttons on the floor of the dining room,'' said Mike Lubin, a vice president and director of Brown Harris Stevens. ''They just fell in love with them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartment in question, on the Upper West Side, was what is known as an Edwardian 5; these early-20th-century bachelor's quarters included a living room, a dining room, a bedroom, a kitchen and a maid's room for the person whose duties included serving dinner to the man of the house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I've also had people tell me they're buying an apartment because of the original windows,'' Mr. Lubin added. ''Once a person said, 'I really like the brass doorbell.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether the doorbell clinched the deal is unknown, but clearly it didn't hurt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Simeon Bankoff, who as executive director of the Historic Districts Council knows a thing or two about the allure of history, counts himself fortunate to have a window in the broom closet of his 1905 brick row house in Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn. Not to mention an odd set of finials in a corner.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These things just made us like the place more,'' Mr. Bankoff said. ''These details are like a beauty mark on a face. We like them for the same reason people liked follies. They're small, cute and useless.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scholars and others who analyze why New Yorkers are so enamored of these accents invariably end up talking about the mysterious pull of the past.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Even in the '20s and '30s, when people had central heating, it was a risk for developers to build without fireplaces,'' said Sandy Isenstadt, an architectural historian and a fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., who studies the significance of items like picture windows. ''They weren't functional, but they had symbolic value.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of these touches perked up otherwise undistinguished living quarters -- ''like a brightly colored tie with a drab suit,'' as Mr. Isenstadt put it -- and he attributes the appeal of these accents in part to their individual, almost cozy scale. ''A small window fit your face,'' he said. ''A shaving closet was made for use by one person at a time.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Akiko Busch, an essayist who explored the significance of the domestic environment in a collection titled ''Geography of Home: Writings on Where We Live,'' calls the phenomenon ''the usefulness of the useless.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Take the Juliet balcony,'' Ms. Busch said. ''Today, none of us have lives that make use of such a thing. But having such a balcony puts us in touch with people who did lead such lives. Momentarily, we're someone else.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''These balconies, along with things like claw-foot tubs and old radiators -- they're not particularly functional, but they're vestiges of the life of the apartment,'' she added. ''They resonate with history, with a sense of continuity. As Americans, we're starved for that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dexter Guerrieri, the president of Vandenberg, the Townhouse Experts, a Manhattan real estate firm that specializes in high-end properties, is acutely aware of the appeal of these small-scale details.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I love those little things,'' said Mr. Guerrieri, who has a particular fondness for the recessed brass lifts in the window sashes in his Brooklyn Heights town house. He also has a soft spot for the crystal doorknobs affixed to brass plates punctuated by small keyholes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the fact sheets that his office draws up to describe various properties, he makes a point of highlighting such accents. The description of a $5 million town house on West 90th Street notes that ''under the historic side stoop there is a sealed storage room with an arched half-moon-shaped window facing the street.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The description of a town house at 47 West 92nd Street cites ''original brass knobs'' on doors. A third fact sheet mentions ''some truly Victorian curiosities, such as a system of dumbwaiters, maid's bells and speaking tubes. ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I see people notice these things and smile,'' Mr. Guerrieri said. ''People are not always articulate about why they like them, but you see clients respond to these frills.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And a purely decorative fireplace? ''People will make a note of it and ask if it works,'' he said. ''But if I say no, they don't seem to care. Because even if a fireplace works, many people don't use it very often. It's just too much trouble, with all that dust in your face.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such touches are typically found in prewar buildings, in part because cheaper construction costs encouraged developers to include embellishments. But they can also be seen in many of the houses that Mary Kay Gallagher, the president of a firm that bears her name, shows clients in Victorian Flatbush, Brooklyn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I see the eyes of potential buyers light up when they see these things,'' Ms. Gallagher said. ''Old radiators? People love them. Phone tubes? They say they'll leave them where they are. Old brass gas extensions? They say that's part of the charm.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And abandoned fireplaces?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''They might add a couple of thousand dollars to the price,'' Ms. Gallagher said. ''They might even help you make a sale. People say they can put plants in them.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The appeal of the faux fireplace, a powerful reminder of the traditional, comforting hearth, is particularly telling. For decades, one of the most sought-after items in New York apartments and town houses was what real estate advertisements shorthanded as the WBFP. The abbreviation conjured visions of a roaring wood fire on a chill winter's night. Close your eyes, and you were practically a Pilgrim.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when the WBFP began falling out of favor in the late 20th century, without missing a beat many people transferred their affections to faux alternatives -- hearths that burned with gas and sometimes with nothing at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fireplace resonates so powerfully that architects are occasionally asked to design nonworking fireplaces. Even the memory of a fireplace can add cachet. Many New York apartments have leftover mantelpieces. And far from finding them an eyesore, residents say that these fireplace ''ghosts'' remind them of a lost grandeur in residential living.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a fast-changing city like New York, the appetite for signs of a vanished era may be especially strong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are so many romantic notions surrounding what it's like to live in New York,'' said Mr. Lubin of Brown Harris Stevens. ''It's a dream come true, a sign that you've made it. That's the appeal of little foyers that are so small, you can't put a stick of furniture in them. They give people the sense that they're living in a 10-room Park Avenue apartment.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These details also remind people that they're living in quarters that could have been occupied by characters out of Edith Wharton, even if it's children who these days occupy most onetime servants' rooms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along with attracting potential buyers and renters, architectural idiosyncrasies can also anchor existing residents. This is the case in the apartment in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, where Fran Leadon, an author of the 2010 edition of the AIA Guide to New York City, lives with his wife, Leigh Anderson, the author of the coming ''Ultimate Game Book for Grownups.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Old-fashioned transoms over the doors bring in light and air. And there's more: ''I have a pointless nook in the hallway made by a slanted wall that is actually my favorite part of the apartment,'' Mr. Leadon said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I don't know why it's there, but I put a tall, skinny plant stand in the space and a little oil painting of Florida,'' added Mr. Leadon, who grew up in the state. ''It's become kind of like a little Florida shrine.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At times, inconvenience would seem to outweigh charm. Fitting shower curtains around an ancient claw-foot bathtub is a considerable challenge. A Juliet balcony has space for, at best, a few pots of geraniums. And let's be honest: who needs a mothballed dumbwaiter?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet such touches are sometimes added as a happy afterthought. When Lon and Michelle Otremba were modernizing their Tudor-style house in Douglas Manor, Queens, they asked their architect, Kevin Wolfe, to conceal a new powder room behind a paneled wall in the billiard room. To open the door, guests pull an almost invisible lip of wood trim.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The room, born of necessity and a reminder of the secret spaces sometimes found in residences created many decades ago, is Ms. Otremba's favorite part of the house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I wish it had a history,'' she said. ''But it's totally charming. I think it's just the fact that it's a secret.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The angry comments flooded in after the federal government announced it was expanding its program to assist unemployed homeowners, as well as borrowers who owe more on their mortgages than their homes are now worth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Why, some asked on The New York Times Web site, should we have to pay for the mistakes of homeowners who lived far beyond their means when credit was easy to get? Shouldn't they pay for their own mistakes?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few wrote in to say the government was doing the right thing because helping those in need now would spare many more homeowners pain later.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of the comments, however, went right to the heart of the criticism of all of the government's bailout programs. After all, the aid for homeowners comes in the wake of bailouts for the banks and the <span class="companylink">American International Group</span>, and then the auto industry. In every case, taxpayer money was on the line. So you can understand all of the anger about paying to fix problems not of their own making.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it made me think about what would be at stake if the government did nothing at all. A government should consider the greater good over the long term, of course, and not just the immediate question of what is fair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the commenters raised a number of valid questions about the mortgage assistance program. Is the government just propping up the real estate market? Shouldn't the market just run its course? And why do renters always fall so low on the economic totem pole?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the government's latest initiative, for instance, some unemployed homeowners will be permitted to make smaller mortgage payments while they get back on their feet -- yet unemployed renters receive nothing. Another part of the program increases the incentives paid to the banks to permanently reduce loan amounts for some homeowners who simply owe more than their homes are worth, as long as they are still current on their payments. No hardship is required.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is that fair? Of course not. Will some irresponsible homeowners receive help they don't really deserve? Probably.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But let's not forget that many distressed homeowners were the victims of bad timing, poor understanding of the loans they were signing up for and a slumping economy. Many families stretched themselves too thin so they could buy into the American dream of home ownership -- an idea supported by both Democrats and Republicans, not to mention the tax code. And some people simply had the misfortune to buy at the top of the market in precisely the wrong area.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It shouldn't be something people should be punished for,'' said Robert J. Shiller, the Yale economist who helped develop <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span> Case-Shiller Index of housing prices. ''It was a national mistake. President Bush, in his weekly radio addresses, was extolling the benefits of homeownership. Implicit in this, he was telling people they were doing the right thing to take these highly leveraged mortgage loans. We can't reasonably think people should be punished for doing that when there is a crisis that is not of their doing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody'sEconomy.com, made much the same argument. ''It isn't completely fair, but we are helping a large number of homeowners who got into this foreclosure nightmare through no fault of their own,'' he said. ''The odds are just too high that if we didn't do something like this, the housing crash would continue on and undermine the recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Nothing in our economy does all that well when house prices are declining,'' he went on, ''because it's still the most important asset in the family balance sheet.'' Beyond that, he said: ''No one will extend credit while home prices are declining. Further declines will push more homeowners underwater, resulting in more foreclosures and more house price declines.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is also the risk that more people will decide that they are so far underwater -- that is, they owe so much more than their homes are worth -- that it makes more sense to just walk away. Experts say people become more likely to walk once their mortgage exceeds their home value by more than 20 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As of the third quarter of last year, more than 10 million homeowners -- or about one in eight -- owed more than 120 percent of their homes' worth, according to <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com. Nearly 4.6 million owed 50 percent more than their homes' value.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The numbers make it easier to understand why the government is trying to strengthen the program -- earlier efforts have not come close to helping the three million to four million homeowners the Treasury initially hoped. Mr. Zandi said he expected that the federal initiatives would ultimately help a fraction of those troubled borrowers, about 1.45 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But to truly break the cycle of declining home values, most experts agree that mortgage servicers must reduce the principal of the mortgage. (To be fair, <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> recently announced a plan to cut up to $3 billion for a select group of 45,000 borrowers.) As part of the expandedprogram, the Treasury is being paid higher incentives to erase principal. But some experts say they think banks will continue to drag their feet, which will prolong the foreclosure crisis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, Casey Mulligan, an economics professor at the University of Chicago, argued that both the Bush and Obama administrations had focused too much on making house payments affordable, based on income levels, and not enough on reducing debt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What we are really doing is propping up the banks in another way,'' he said. ''They are very powerful politically and they are very good at getting the government to give them money. So I think that's why we don't deal with the real simple problem, which is negative equity. Banks believe, and they are probably right, that there are probably some homeowners they can squeeze the money out of and they don't want to give up the opportunity to squeeze such people.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fred Block, a sociology professor at the University of California, Davis, said that a lot of the anger I saw in the reader comments should have been directed at the banks and the overall lack of regulation. For all those homeowners who may (or may not) have treated their homes as A.T.M.'s, there were lenders who permitted the transaction. And for every lender that permitted the transaction, there were supposed to be some limits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What people should be angry about is that we've had an economy that has been marked by these bubbles,'' Mr. Block said. ''We all believe that people should be rewarded for hard work and ideas and so forth. But bubbles, by their nature, are capricious in what they reward, and they violate the moral principles that most people believe in. That is why financial reform legislation is so important.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So you can blame the guy in Arizona who got in over his head. But that wouldn't be entirely fair.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SAND is not a good foundation for a house, and it certainly wasn't a good foundation for a housing boom. But now home prices are starting to recover in some so-called sand states.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During the housing boom early in the last decade, the strongest markets were in the states that could offer sand and sun to lure prospective purchasers, and many came to accept that the aging of the baby boomers meant that such retirement havens would prosper forever.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when the boom turned to bust, buyers found that what went up the most was likely to come down the fastest.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, there are signs of life in real estate markets in two of the sand states, California and Arizona. Florida and Nevada, though, continue to suffer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The accompanying chart, using seasonally adjusted prices for single-family homes from the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller indexes, shows that in the three California regions measured, there have been recoveries ranging from 8.5 percent in Los Angeles to 14.7 percent in San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In each case, the region incorporates suburban areas that can range far from the city in the center. There is no doubt considerable variation within each market, and often it is the farthest-out markets -- the ones with the longest drives to employment -- that have done the worst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the Phoenix region, the recovery has been 7.4 percent, which exceeds the gain in all but one of the 13 markets covered by the indexes and not in the sand states. Minneapolis has climbed 10.7 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the two sand-state markets in Florida (Miami and Tampa) and the one in Nevada (Las Vegas) have shown only the smallest of recoveries, amounting to 1.2 percent or less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of the sand-state markets have a long way to go, and it may be many years or even decades before they set new highs. Phoenix and Las Vegas prices could double from the January levels reported this week and still be below the highs set in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of the sand markets need to rise by more than 50 percent to get back to peak levels. That is true of only one other market, Detroit, a depressed region that largely missed the boom but has taken part in the bust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those figures indicate that the problems of underwater mortgages, which the Obama administration is now starting to address, are likely to endure for some time unless there are many more foreclosures or reductions in principal of outstanding loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The markets that appear to have the smallest problems in that regard are Dallas and Denver, each of which could rise above previous highs with gains of less than 10 percent from January levels. Others that need gains of less than 20 percent are Boston, Cleveland and Charlotte, N.C.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York suffered less than many markets, but it is also a market that has not shown any sign of recovery. It was the only one of the 20 markets to set a new low in January. The price level then was about the same as it was almost six years earlier, in the spring of 2004.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CHARTS: Getting Warmer: Home prices soared in the so-called sand states of California, Florida, Arizona and Nevada during the housing boom, and then collapsed in the bust. Now markets in California and Arizona are showing signs of recovery, but others are not. All remain far below their mid-decade highs. Among other markets, Minneapolis has recovered the most, and New York has shown no recovery. (Source: <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span> )</p>

</div><div class="author">By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY </div><div>847 words</div><div>2 April 2010</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>18</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apartment prices in Manhattan rose modestly in the first three months of this year compared with the previous quarter, but they were well below the peak of 2008, according to sales reports to be released on Friday by four major brokerage firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apartments in Manhattan sold for an average price of $1.4 million in the first quarter this year, according to closing data tracked by the firms. That is well off the peak in the first quarter of 2008, when apartments sold for about $1.7 million. The 2010 price is a slight increase over the average price in all of 2009, when it was around $1.3 million. It might be some time, however, before the Manhattan real estate market returns to its frothy heights. Appraisers, economists and brokers all cited as impediments to growth the troubled state of the national economy, the difficulty in getting mortgages and the backlog of condominiums in various stages of construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're going to see flat growth of prices through the year, if not a little longer,'' said Diane M. Ramirez, the president of Halstead Property. ''We're not going to have any kind of 'V' recovery.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartments that sold best were far from the sprawling Park Avenue co-ops and glassy luxury condominiums that grace real estate ads and appear in movies and on television. Sixty percent of the apartments that closed in the first quarter cost less than $1 million, according to data tracked by <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>. While brokers might point to spending by the very wealthy, it is the buyers of lower-priced apartments who are driving the market, said Pamela Liebman, the chief executive officer of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That one-bedroom market is just really, really busy right now,'' Ms. Liebman said. ''People are taking advantage of the low interest rate, the low price.'' In 2007 and 2008, two-bedrooms were the hot commodity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The borough's wealthiest residents were far less active in the market than they were two years ago. Wall Street bankers and hedge-fund executives might have earned record bonuses last year, but fewer apartments that cost more than $10 million are being sold. In the first quarter of 2008, 71 apartments sold for more than $10 million, compared with 9 in the same time in 2009, according to Gregory J. Heym, an economist who prepared the reports for Halstead and Brown Harris Stevens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This past quarter, 18 apartments sold for more than $10 million. That is partly because two years ago, more people were closing on apartments in high-priced buildings like the Plaza and 15 Central Park West. But it is also because wealthy buyers seem to be holding out for bargains, relatively speaking.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are obviously people out there who can well afford it,'' said Hall F. Willkie, the president of Brown Harris Stevens. ''But they, too, are price sensitive and want to know that what they're getting is good value for the current market.'' Mr. Willkie said that sale prices for $10 million-plus apartments had fallen about 20 percent since 2008.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The end of easy credit that enabled buyers to take out big mortgages has also had an effect. Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel, which collected data for the brokerage firm Prudential Douglas Elliman, said it was much harder to finance high-priced apartments with small down payments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You don't have 35-year-old investment bankers putting 10 percent down on $4 million apartments,'' Mr. Miller said. ''The net is not cast as wide for qualifying mortgages. That has not expanded, and it probably won't in our lifetimes.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are signs that more people are in the market to buy. All four brokerage firms reported that the number of deals rose sharply in the past year. Buyers closed on 2,299 apartments in Manhattan in the first quarter, compared with 1,200 in the first quarter of 2009 and 2,857 in the first quarter of 2008, according to Mr. Heym.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Liebman said that even in this sluggish real estate market, she had tracked 190 bidding wars in the first quarter. Mr. Miller credited the bidding wars to the fact that while there were 8,027 apartments for sale, a typical first-quarter figure, just a small percentage were at prices buyers were willing to pay. Buyers are simply ignoring overpriced apartments and concentrating on more realistic ones, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Miller said the well-priced properties were ''moving much more quickly than in prior quarters.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That is a bit of good news for brokers, who point out that Manhattan is still holding up more strongly than the rest of the nation's real estate market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''While other parts of the country have taken years and years to recover, there's a lot of confidence in the market,'' Ms. Liebman said. ''The biggest complaint I'm getting from my brokers is 'I need more property.' ''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON (AP) -- A private trade group said on Thursday that the manufacturing sector expanded in March at its strongest pace since July 2004, but the Commerce Department reported that construction spending fell in February to its lowest level since November 2002.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, initial claims for unemployment benefits fell slightly last week as the recovering economy moved closer to generating more jobs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The latest reports reflected the halting nature of the economic recovery. While manufacturing is expected to help lead a recovery, real estate remains a weak spot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Institute for Supply Management, a trade group of purchasing executives, said that its gauge of industrial companies rose to 59.6 in March, from 56.5 in February. It is the eighth consecutive month of expansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Economists polled by Thomson Reuters had expected the measure to read 57. A level above 50 indicates growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Factories are increasing production for exports and their customers are slowing the drawdown of their inventories, helping power the economic recovery worldwide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among economists, the expectation is that continued expansion of factory production will eventually lead to more hiring.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Labor Department is scheduled to release the March employment report on Friday. Economists expect that it will show that the economy generated 190,000 jobs last month, the most in three years. Analysts also forecast that the unemployment rate will remain 9.7 percent for the third consecutive month, according to Thomson Reuters. On Thursday, the agency said that new claims for jobless benefits dropped 6,000, to a seasonally adjusted 439,000, nearly matching analysts' estimates. It is the fourth drop in five weeks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The four-week average of claims, which smoothes volatility, fell nearly 7,000, to 447,250, the lowest total since the week of Sept. 13, 2008, just before <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> collapsed and the financial crisis intensified.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the third report on Thursday, the Commerce Department reported that spending on construction projects in February fell 1.3 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $846.23 billion. Economists were predicting that builders would pare spending by 1 percent.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apartment prices in Manhattan rose modestly in the first three months of this year compared with the previous quarter, but they were well below the peak of 2008, according to sales reports to be released on Friday by four major brokerage firms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apartments in Manhattan sold for an average price of $1.4 million in the first quarter this year, according to closing data tracked by the firms. That is well off the peak in the first quarter of 2008, when apartments sold for about $1.7 million. The 2010 price is a slight increase over the average price in all of 2009, when it was around $1.3 million. It may be some time, however, before the Manhattan real estate market returns to its frothy heights. Appraisers, economists and brokers all cited as impediments to growth the troubled state of the national economy, the difficulty in getting mortgages and the backlog of condominiums in various stages of construction.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're going to see flat growth of prices through the year, if not a little longer," said Diane M. Ramirez, the president of Halstead Property. "We're not going to have any kind of 'V' recovery."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartments that sold best were far from the sprawling Park Avenue co-ops and glassy luxury condominiums that grace real estate ads and appear in movies and on television. Sixty percent of the apartments that closed in the first quarter cost less than $1 million, according to data tracked by <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>. While brokers might point to spending by the very wealthy, it is the buyers of lower-priced apartments who are driving the market, said Pamela Liebman, the chief executive officer of <span class="companylink">the Corcoran Group</span>.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IT'S been two years since Janna Levine has stepped into a salon. Her blowouts, cuts, highlights and even her Brazilian keratin frizz-reducing treatments are all done in the privacy of her Manhattan apartment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She met her house call hairstylist, Gaetano Ruvio, at the Irene L. Salon on the Upper East Side where, at the time, he worked one or two days a week when he wasn't serving downtown clients at his full-time gig at the Miguel Lopez Salon and Spa in SoHo. Their memories differ a bit as to who asked whom first. Mr. Ruvio remembers being the one to suggest the arrangement; Ms. Levine thinks she initially broached the topic. Regardless, the negotiations were successful, and before long, cellphone numbers were exchanged, text messaging commenced and Mr. Ruvio started arriving at Ms. Levine's door with a backpack of supplies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I'll go to my clients' homes anytime before 11 a.m. or after 8 at night,'' he said. When Mr. Ruvio is not at the salon or the gym, he's open for business (excluding Sundays). His accommodating schedule, not to mention the reduced prices he charges, don't go unappreciated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''When you're sitting and getting highlights in the salon for three hours, your life is on hold for three hours,'' said Ms. Levine, a real estate agent in New York. ''Not only am I saving money, but I am also in my apartment, so I can sit in front of my computer and shoot out e-mails. I don't need to take time off work.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not uncommon for hairdressers to make house calls for events like weddings or bar mitzvahs. But a seemingly underground contingency of individuals book their regular beauty appointments directly through their hairstylists, eyebrow groomers, bikini waxers and facialists, often unbeknownst to the technician's or stylist's employing salon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Linda Wells, editor in chief of Allure magazine, has taken note of the phenomenon. House calls, she said, ''started as something that were more expensive. It was a celebrity preparing for the Oscars kind of thing.'' But these days, ''people are whispering to their stylists to come to their homes and a lot of the time it is less expensive,'' she said. ''The client is paying in cash and not paying overhead. It can be sneaky.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Ms. Levine saves only a nominal amount on her weekly blowouts, she estimates she pays less than half the price for other treatments than she would in a salon (approximately $150 for highlights instead of $350). And then there is the time saved traveling to and from the salon, ''really the greatest luxury,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kevin Stamler, a law student at the University of Southern California, who also owns an event planning company and a promotions company, has an even more economical set-up with his hairstylist, Rian Heart, who works for Salon Sessions in Pasadena, Calif.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Stamler met Ms. Heart at a nightclub in Los Angeles. ''She told me she's a hairstylist and said: 'I'll come to your house. I do it for people all the time.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She even offered to cut his wavy locks free in exchange for the clients she foresaw Mr. Stamler sending her way, thanks to his business connections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Heart usually charges $100 for a house call, the same price Salon Sessions charges for her haircuts. But the cost can vary.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Say a girl is having a bachelorette party and she wants all her girlfriends to come over and get their hair done,'' Ms. Heart said. ''Most of the time, I'll do the organizer's hair for free if they get five or more people to come, because I've already made that money and some back.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's no surprise that many people in the beauty industry are looking to make a side dollar or two. Marina Valmy de Haydu, director of the Christine Valmy International Schools, estimates that salons pay their employees around 40 to 60 percent commission on services rendered (excluding tips).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But there can be a lot of hands dipping into that pot. There is ''one person washing you, another massaging your head, another towel-drying your hair,'' said Nicolle Cannone, a Westchester-based owner of a line of baby clothing, who gets at-home sessions with a stylist.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After Mrs. Cannone's sister became friendly with a hairdresser at a pricey Manhattan hair salon (which Mrs. Cannone did not want named as to not jeopardize her stylist's full-time job), a deal was arranged for the stylist to come to Mrs. Cannone's home, where both sisters' hair is cut in the hallway at $60 a head (more than a 50 percent discount from the salon price).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The average person doesn't really know that they can do these side deals,'' said Ying Chu, the beauty and health director at Marie Claire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Chu and Ms. Wells seem wary of forgoing the salon for most procedures. They both noted that a salon offers amenities such as lighting, proper chairs and the opportunity to escape the distractions of the home or office, not to mention legal liability if something goes wrong.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''On the upside, yes, they are coming to you,'' Ms. Wells said. ''But do you really want a bikini wax in your bedroom?''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, Ms. Wells occasionally has her hair blown out at the office by River Lloyd of Serge Normant at John Frieda in downtown Manhattan. And once a month, an eyebrow specialist, Maribeth Madron, who works twice a week at the Pipino Salon at Spa Chakra on Fifth in Manhattan, comes to the Marie Claire offices to pluck and shape the brows of 10 to 15 employees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While some salon owners interviewed stated that they would fire any employee who provided services to clients independently, Garren, the owner of Garren New York salon, says it all comes down to trust and respect.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's a topic where you sort of turn a blind eye,'' Garren said. ''As long as they're doing what they need to do us for us during the hours they're working for the Garren salon, I don't have a problem with it.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Mr. Ruvio's case, the Miguel Lopez Salon and Spa understands that his house-call clients aren't taking away from business, as most of his personal clients are Upper East Side mothers who wouldn't make the trek downtown, Mr. Ruvio said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He had one warning for those considering home haircuts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It can get messy,'' Mr. Ruvio said, ''but fortunately they have housekeepers, so somebody is there to clean up after.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I'M not entirely sure how I got into this mess. I know it started with my husband's saying we were moving back to New York for his job and with our putting our house up for sale and buying a second smaller one in California to return to some day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And then, as part of the whole thing, I decided to give away just about everything -- simplicity was what I craved, I guess -- and I got rid of sofas, beds, candles shaped like feet and all my husband's black alligator shirts. For a while, a very short while, everything seemed perfect, under control and real simple.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But as soon as the real estate agents and prospective buyers started tromping through the house where I have lived for nearly eight years, I had to decamp to my nearby cottage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And I realized it was very echo-y over here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What had I done? Not only would I never sell my house, but now I also had two mortgages and was about to start paying an enormous Manhattan rent and all the other expenses of life there. Curling up in a fetal position seemed the best solution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps other people handle situations like this more gracefully.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when my friend Susan came over one day to see the cottage, she found me sitting on the floor and leaning against a wall, hyperventilating, with my laptop propped on my knees.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''This is really how you work?'' she asked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''No, this is how I don't work,'' I said. ''This is how I contemplate impending financial ruin.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There is a problem, and we have to fix it right now,'' Susan said, with conviction. And although what she was saying was bad, the decisive way she said it was something to hang on to. I was ready, at this point, to follow pretty much any plan that was a plan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Susan, who owns three houses in town and rents them, furnished, to vacationers and other short-term tenants, suggested I do the same thing with my cottage. Great location, nice floor plan, pretty garden, no-brainer, she said. She predicted steady demand from all those Europeans who come to Mill Valley in tour buses, looking for the giant redwood trees. Plus, when I'm in town, she added, I could stay here.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I nodded.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''So,'' she continued, ''you need a couch and a coffee table and a king bed -- everyone wants a king when they're on vacation -- and a queen bed and a table with six chairs and dishes and a couple of rugs and 12 bath towels -- they go through towels like crazy -- and a panini maker.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''A panini maker?'' I repeated, because I hadn't seen that one coming.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People love having one,'' she said. ''We'll put it in the description as a bonus feature.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She started making a list.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''What's your budget?'' she asked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Zero,'' I said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She frowned.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With any grand plan, there comes a point when an insurmountable obstacle appears on the horizon. Any grand planner, however, hops over that obstacle as if it were a crack in the sidewalk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Send an e-mail to everyone you know,'' she said. ''Ask for castoffs. You know their garages are full.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Is it possible to furnish a house with scrounged items, for little or no money? A decade or so ago, I would have said no. But the Internet has turned the whole world into what is essentially one huge swap meet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We've become conditioned, after a few years of living with <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span> and <span class="companylink">eBay</span>, to realize how miraculously easy it is to give-and-take and find just the right buyer for the sort of niche-market items -- a 42-inch-round table, a queen-size dust ruffle (white, please), a floor lamp -- that used to be consigned to garage sales. Or the trash.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So, I sent a group e-mail message, asking a few dozen people to participate in the Internet-age equivalent of a barn raising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's kind of embarrassing, but in my pre-move delirium I got rid of so many things that I don't have the items I need,'' I wrote. ''So at the risk of sounding like a reality-show hoarder, I appeal to my friends. I am happy to borrow, buy or clear items from your overcrowded storage space.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then I hit send and started to wonder, almost immediately, if people would just think I was crazy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the responses started to arrive within minutes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I have one very nice little desk (4 feet), a wood book case (about 3 X 4) and a three and a half foot round outdoor table and four chairs, one with ottoman,'' my friend Cathryn wrote, adding, ''If you are feeling bored/lonely or just want to come over, we'll be drinking G&amp;Ts on the patio around 6:30 this evening.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next, I heard from Dinna (taupe rug), Tina (lamps and nightstand), Cindi (living room chair), Annika (wicker chair), Kate (queen-size bed and dining room table) and Stephanie (mirror, framed posters and dishes).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Get over here right now,'' my friend Amy wrote. ''I have a whole garage full of stuff for you.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next day, I drove around town, picking up the loot. Some of it was free (''Thank you, thank you, for taking this off my hands,'' one friend said, as if I were doing her the favor), and the rest of it was a bargain (I paid $50 for a practically new red rag rug that Pottery Barn still has in stock for $169). Some of it was even incredibly beautiful (Stephanie's round, gilt-framed mirror).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With every item I dragged over the threshold of my cottage, I started to feel luckier and luckier. Stephanie, who has the best eye of anyone I know, came over to arrange the furniture, and a decorating theme emerged -- beige with shots of red in each room -- as we hung posters and put new bulbs in lamps.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cottage looked homey. Cozy. Even when I was alone there, it was always full of friends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the end, all I needed to buy from strangers was a TV (a used 42-inch set, because Susan said vacationers like a big screen, and a television table, $350 on <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span>) and a sleeper couch ($370 for one with new slipcovers, from the home-consignment store).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And last week, while sitting here on the new couch with my feet up on a coffee table, working on my laptop, my real estate broker said there was an offer on my other house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Do you have somewhere you can move to in 30 days?'' she asked.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, I said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the final Wife/Mother/Worker/Spy column.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sheldon H. Solow's swooping 50-story office tower on West 57th Street with the giant red ''9'' in front is half empty, a stunning development for a building that commands some of the highest rents in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2008, Mr. Solow won approval for a $4 billion complex of seven towers on nine acres along First Avenue, but the only thing erected there has been a parking lot. Work has shut down on another Solow project, a residential building on York Avenue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past 15 months, several executives at his company have quit or been fired. Mr. Solow, who is 81, is said to have medical problems, and his wife, Mia, and son Stefan have taken control of the business, at least temporarily.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All of this has real estate, art and political circles wondering: What has become of the House of Solow?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There's a bit of a mystery surrounding the Solow empire right now,'' said Edward Rubin, an architect and a member of Community Board 6 on the East Side.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Solow did not respond to a request for an interview made through his office, nor did Jay B. Fischoff, the consultant recently brought in by the family to manage their residential and commercial buildings.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, Mr. Solow's long running legal battle with <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> ended with an $85.7 million judgment against him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one doubts that Mr. Solow's net worth remains in the billions, but much of it is in real estate and art, and there are signs that the family is moving to raise cash. The Solow family has quietly asked certain deep-pocketed developers whether they would be interested in buying some of their undeveloped land, according to a real estate executive and a lawyer who were briefed on the offering and insisted on anonymity, lest they antagonize Mr. Solow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A prominent broker who knows Mr. Solow said the developer was focused on his ''philanthropic stuff.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But others who know him find that explanation lacking. In more than 50 years of building high-end properties, Mr. Solow has been loath to let go of even the smallest details of a project, any of his land, his art or his many grudges against rival developers, blue chip tenants and friends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even Samuel H. Lindenbaum, the real estate lawyer, is in the dark about his friend of 40 years. ''I wish somebody would pick up a phone and call me,'' he said with a note of sadness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An imposing figure who is always impeccably dressed, Mr. Solow is regarded as an exacting, even brilliant developer whose mercurial disposition can alienate friends and foes alike. Even those who know Mr. Solow well are reluctant to talk about him publicly because, they say, he embraces litigation with the passion of a sports fan. He has more than 200 lawsuits under his belt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Sheldon has earned a reputation for building beautiful, very high-end buildings,'' said Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York. ''He has clearly done it in his own way and in his own fashion.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Mr. Solow described his son Stefan in 2007 as the ''heir apparent,'' Stefan, who owns a farm in Kansas and lives in East Hampton, was clearly uncomfortable with the mantle. He has never consistently worked at his father's side, real estate executives and former Solow employees say.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked if there had been a changing of the guard, Stefan Solow, who is 35, said he was not interested in talking ''at this time.'' With his father's characteristic bluntness, he added, ''I don't really care what people in New York think of me.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With Mr. Fischoff's help, the family's top priority appears to be leasing about 800,000 square feet of space at 9 West 57th Street. The vacancies there, which brokers say could easily fetch $60 million to $70 million a year in rent, have put a crimp in the cash flow for the building and Mr. Solow's multibillion-dollar empire.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The space, much of it once occupied by <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span>, has been empty for two years. Last fall, a Brazilian bank wanted to lease space in the building, according to real estate brokers. But Mr. Solow wanted boom-time rents of $200 per square foot. Yet he was furious when the bank subsequently moved to the top of the nearby General Motors Building, another 50-story landmark he has coveted for years. The bank agreed to pay annual rent of $130 per square foot, an eye-opening sum in the current market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In November, Mr. Solow's longtime broker at 9 West 57th, Stephen Siegel of <span class="companylink">CB Richard Ellis</span>, quit and, according to court papers, his firm filed a lien for what it said were $1.6 million in unpaid commissions. But Mr. Siegel came back in March, after winning a competition to represent the building that was conducted by Stefan Solow and Mr. Fischoff. The lien was dropped.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The son of a bricklayer from Brooklyn, Mr. Solow dropped out of New York University in the 1950s to go into the real estate business. By the late 1960s, he was a well-tailored bachelor who drove around town in a Rolls-Royce as he built luxury buildings like Rivers Bend, a 22-story white brick tower near Gracie Mansion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At that time, he took a huge gamble, buying one parcel after another on 57th Street, near Fifth Avenue, for what would become his iconic skyscraper.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he refused to rent the underground retail space for 30 years, saying he had to find the right tenant. In the end, he installed his own restaurant, Brasserie 8 1/2, and decorated it with pieces from his own enormous art collection, which includes works by Matisse, Picasso, Giacometti and an enormous erotic painting by Balthus that hangs on the wall behind his desk on the 45th floor of 9 West 57th.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Solow also embarked on a quest to develop one of the last large parcels of undeveloped land in Manhattan. In 2000, he and the Fisher real estate family won the bidding for 9.2 acres of land along First Avenue, between 35th and 41st Streets, with an offer of $680 million. It would take another seven years to clean the land of toxic substances and get city approval for a $4 billion development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, Mr. Solow had a bitter falling out with the Fisher family, who agreed to be bought out for $227 million. Last year, the Fishers sued Mr. Solow, saying that he still owed them about $111 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To make matters worse, during the collapse of the markets in 2008, <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> seized his collateral -- municipal bonds -- for letters of credit totaling $500 million that were used to buy the land. Mr. Solow countersued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, Justice Bernard B. Fried of New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan threw out his claim that <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> had conspired against him when it seized the collateral and sold the bonds to satisfy the loan. The judgment means that Mr. Solow still owes <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> $85.7 million, the difference between the debt and the value of the bonds.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Solow, in his own steadfast way, refused to settle the case.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tenant advocates and many of his own renters regard Laurence Gluck as the scourge of subsidized middle-class housing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has bought more than a dozen New York City complexes since 2004 and removed rent ceilings from thousands of apartments. He borrowed $250 million to buy and renovate the storied Riverton Houses in Harlem, pocketed tens of millions in profit and then lost the buildings in foreclosure earlier this month, leaving them an early casualty of the speculative real estate boom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But city and federal housing officials looking to rescue a troubled development in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, have begun viewing Mr. Gluck in a different light: as its possible savior.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The officials had tangled with Mr. Gluck for years over his plans to buy the 33-story building, known as Tivoli Towers. Now they are constructing a deal that would allow him to buy Tivoli for $11.25 million, while preserving it as affordable housing until 2040. Mr. Gluck would be required to spend about $15 million rehabilitating the battered building, which is plagued by faulty elevators, mold and leaky roofs that flood certain floors when it rains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pending deal highlights the changing terrain as speculators, investors, tenant advocates and housing officials adjust to the realities of the post-boom era. Property values and rents at large complexes have fallen by as much as 50 percent over the past two years. Foreclosures are up, and lenders are no longer doling out cheap loans to investors and speculators like Mr. Gluck, whose company owns 24,000 apartments in New York, Chicago, Washington and San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the proposal also illustrates the forgiving nature of the real estate world, where an operator can walk away from a financial disaster relatively unscathed, or even better off, and where a down market is as much an opportunity as an up one. Marc Jahr, president of the city's Housing Development Corporation, said the choice was stark. Officials could go with Mr. Gluck ''with this package we've put into place, or the building continues along this downward arc and conditions become more difficult and unendurable for tenants.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tenants and city and federal housing officials agree that Tivoli's current owner, Donald Lentnek, has failed to maintain a building that was once the pride of the neighborhood. Mr. Lentnek did not respond to several phone calls seeking comment. Still, Councilwoman Letitia James and tenants at Tivoli, a bland concrete structure that soars over the neighborhood, are highly skeptical of Mr. Gluck, based on his financial problems at Riverton and a large residential complex in Silver Spring, Md., as well as his reputation for tangling with tenant groups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are great concerns about Laurence Gluck taking over this property,'' said Alice Mitchell, the soft-spoken president of the tenant union at Tivoli. ''It seems he's a predatory developer.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A real estate lawyer turned landlord, Mr. Gluck said he was unhappy that tenants saw him in such a negative light.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His strategy during the boom years was to buy aging residential complexes built with state subsidies, mainly through the Mitchell-Lama program. As the subsidies expired, he reaped a fortune by replacing rent-regulated residents with tenants willing to pay market-rate rents that were two to three times as high.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he renovated many of the properties, and tenants and housing advocates agree that they are well maintained.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But along the way, he has battled with tenant groups at Independence Plaza in Manhattan, Meadow Manor in Flushing, Queens, and Castleton Park on Staten Island. Advocates say he has failed to honor promises about how much rent he would charge; Mr. Gluck portrays himself as a friend of the tenant, going beyond what the law requires.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gluck bought Riverton, a middle-class complex with more than 1,200 apartments, in 2005 for $131 million. Riverton was never part of the Mitchell-Lama program, but more than 90 percent of its units were rent stabilized. A year later Mr. Gluck refinanced his debt with $250 million in loans, allowing him to modernize the lobbies, install new elevators and glass doors, landscape the center courtyard, and pocket tens of millions in profit.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rents covered only a fraction of the monthly debt payments. Mr. Gluck had estimated he could convert 650 units to market rates by December 2011, but by the time he neared default in August 2008, he had converted only 128.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gluck said that at Riverton and other complexes, he never tried to remove tenants by claiming phony lease infractions, as other landlords have been accused of doing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There was no business plan to send out Golub notices like Christmas cards like some of my competitors,'' Mr. Gluck said, referring to the letters sent to tenants when their leases are not being renewed. Mr. Gluck said he relied on what he called ''natural organic turnover'' at Riverton, which, he added, was about 11 percent, or two times the citywide average.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Riverton residents, many of whom have lived there for decades, dispute his notion of a naturally high turnover rate, although they acknowledge that Mr. Gluck did not try to evict tenants indiscriminately. Cynthia Allen, the tenant leader at Riverton, did recall that Mr. Gluck offered some tenants money to move.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gluck concedes that he put too much debt on the project during a period of ''reckless liquidity.'' At the March 11 foreclosure sale for Riverton, Ms. Allen said she ''felt bad'' for the residents of Tivoli. ''Send them my condolences,'' she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Gluck signed a contract to buy Tivoli in 2005, with plans to take it out of the Mitchell-Lama program. But tenants discovered a covenant that prohibited Tivoli from leaving Mitchell-Lama until 2024. Years of litigation ensued, with city officials; the borough president, Marty Markowitz; and Senator Charles E. Schumer rallying to the tenants' side. Today, Mr. Gluck still has a valid contract, but no hope of obtaining private financing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eager to stem the loss of housing for poor, working and even middle-class New Yorkers, the city's Housing Development Corporation has agreed to provide Mr. Gluck with low-interest mortgages totaling about $45.7 million, an amount that includes paying off loans owed by the current owner. Rents will be allowed to rise, in many cases double. Ms. Mitchell, the tenant leader at Tivoli, said rent for her one-bedroom apartment would rise to $1,370, from $656.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the Department of Housing and Urban Development will provide tenants with larger rent subsidies to cover the increase. Tenants will be required to pay 30 percent of their income in rent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In return, Mr. Gluck has agreed to rent regulation and is required to keep Tivoli in Mitchell-Lama until 2040. His about-face, he said, represented a change in philosophy and a recognition of the depressed market. ''Our plan is to keep this building affordable,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Ms. James, the city councilwoman who represents the neighborhood, and Tivoli tenants said they did not understand why the city would turn over Tivoli to a landlord who lost Riverton because he could not pay the mortgage.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. James and the tenant association are trying to negotiate clauses that will protect current tenants from harassment or ouster, including residents who may have inherited an apartment from a parent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dina Levy, director of organizing at the Urban Homesteading Assistance Board, which has worked with residents of Riverton and Tivoli Towers, said that residents faced a dilemma. ''They have to make a choice between getting desperately needed repairs and taking their chances living under Larry Gluck,'' she said, ''or fighting the deal and risking that the building sits in limbo, with no repairs getting done.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SANYA, China -- One developer is building what he calls Asia's largest hotel, with space for a casino and a greyhound racetrack.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Visun Royal Yacht Club, China's largest, plans to buy a helicopter for the use of its members. A golf course that charges $180 per round is opening 220 villas, each with its own butler, swimming pool and spa -- ''I want to get it into the Guinness Book of World Records for the most spas anywhere,'' the manager says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then there are the property speculators flying to this resort town from across China with bagfuls of cash, to buy apartments whose cost per square foot rivals parts of Manhattan. Five-star hotels during the recent Lunar New Year holiday charged $1,500 or more per night; one company charged $80 just to camp out in a tent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the last two months, Hainan, an island the size of Belgium in the South China Sea, has become a potent symbol of China's economic vitality -- or, perhaps, its excesses. Even in a country where new wealth spawns new tales of luxury living every day, Hainan is viewed with a mix of awe, envy and disgust.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The boom here, unfolding as much of the world grapples with a recession, is fueled by a first-of-its-kind edict from the nation's top leaders: On Dec. 31, the State Council, the Chinese cabinet, issued a memorandum that said Hainan had been designated a ''test case'' in developing an ''internationally competitive tourist destination.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Investors are interpreting that as a no-holds-barred effort to remake Hainan into the Chinese equivalent of Monaco, Las Vegas and Hawaii. While there is no clear indication that the authorities will permit the introduction of licensed casino gambling, some are betting that Hainan could overtake Macao, the former Portguese colony that is now under Chinese sovereignty, as China's preferred island of iniquity.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's as if they've injected a growth hormone into the economic development here, and people are wondering how it will all turn out,'' said Xie Xiangxiang, the head of the Sanya Tourism Association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hainan gold rush is the buzz across China. One American businessman in Beijing, Christopher Reynolds, said a group of Chinese artists told him to invest in Hainan real estate. Chinese couples on dates in Beijing restaurants chatter about it. In February, the average sales price of property in Sanya and Haikou, Hainan's two main cities, showed a 50 percent increase over the same month last year, five times the national rate, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''People are coming with entire bags full of cash,'' said Raymond Hau, general manager of the Sun Valley Golf Resort, which is building the 220 luxury villas. ''I've seen this myself. A man had a bag and unzipped it. Boom. 'Here's the deposit,' he said. 'I want two apartments.'''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Hau shook his head. ''It's crazy. It can only happen in China.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The golf resort is popular with the privileged. The president of Kazakhstan shot a hole in one here. And on a recent afternoon, when an attendant opened the passenger door of a black sport-utility vehicle that had just pulled up, a pile of large-denomination Chinese bills fluttered to the ground.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Billboards across Hainan advertise property for sale in developments with names like Miami and East Bahamas. The face of Zhang Ziyi, one of China's most popular actresses, is plastered on some of the advertisements. The most prominent development is a series of four luxury apartment towers and a ''seven star'' hotel on Phoenix Island, a spit of sand off the coast that was created by the provincial government as a cruise ship dock.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apartments -- sweeping sea views, bathtubs on balconies and sofas wrapped in velvet -- are being pre-sold for an average of $885 per square foot, comparable to New York prices, said Wu Lei, a spokeswoman for the real estate company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hype over Hainan has inspired criticism from many quarters. In an interview, Han Han, China's most popular blogger, expressed contempt for the investment pouring into the island. Last month, People's Daily and China Youth Daily, both official newspapers, ran editorials lamenting the rising housing and hotel prices. The editors appeared concerned that the stratospheric prices could highlight, for many Chinese, the growing class divide in this country.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''How can we create a stable and harmonious living environment if the island's ordinary residents do not have the ability to buy housing?'' wrote the editors of People's Daily.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even officials in Hainan seem worried. In mid-January, the provincial government announced a temporary halt to new commercial development projects. Gambling is another uncertainty. Some officials have said only modest forms of betting will be allowed, while others say Hainan could push the limits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the moment, gambling is banned across China, except in Macao. The history of Hainan in the 1990s offers a cautionary tale. Early that decade, after the Chinese government had designated Hainan one of the country's ''special economic zones,'' property speculators flocked to the island. Some of China's most successful real estate magnates, including Pan Shiyi of Soho China and Feng Lun of the Vantone Group, made their first fortunes on Hainan. Across China, the island's freewheeling capitalism became synonymous with corruption. The bubble burst after a few years, and the island stagnated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, in Sanya, even those benefiting from the current boom say property and hotel prices have reached absurd levels. ''There's no real economy,'' said Lin Mingkun, the manager of the yacht club and a condo owner. ''It's a bubble economy.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some residents say they are being priced out of housing options. On the west side of the yacht marina, there is a neighborhood where more than 1,000 fishermen and family members live in cramped alleyways.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The families have lived here for generations, but local officials and the real estate company that owns the yacht club, Hongzhou Group, are trying to persuade them to move off the land. Four women sitting outside one home said the Hongzhou Group was offering less than $20 a square foot as compensation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If we get kicked out, there won't be a house for the next generation,'' said one, Ms. Shi, 48, who agreed to speak on the condition that only her last name be printed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Lin said the Hongzhou Group was building an apartment complex across the harbor for the families and would pay them more than $40 per square foot for their property. The fishing boats would be moved into another bay, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hongzhou company, with its gleaming Times Coast condominium development by the marina, is in the vanguard of Hainan's transformation. The yacht club already boasts more than 80 members who have each paid $92,000 for the privilege of parking their boats here for 23 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In China, Sanya will be the leader in luxury leisure,'' Wang Dafu, the owner of Hongzhou, said one afternoon while cruising the bay in his 72-foot Pershing yacht.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He puffed on a Cohiba cigar. ''The reason you earn money,'' he said, ''is to spend it.''</p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To hear it described by one broker, the football-field-long former Navy warehouse off the Brooklyn waterfront inspired awe from all but a few of the prospective buyers invited on a tour of the long-vacant site last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But that awe, said the broker, Chris Havens, the chief executive of Creative Real Estate Group in Brooklyn, quickly dissolved into skepticism as the financial realities of the World War I-era building became clear.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 1.1 million square feet, the 94-year-old edifice in Sunset Park, commonly referred to as Federal Building No. 2, has one of the largest floor plates in the borough and may be the largest vacant structure for sale in the city. The city's Economic Development Corporation is marketing it for the federal government, with the goal of filling it with light manufacturing operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Potential owners are realizing that with such superlatives come expensive challenges.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I love big, vacant buildings, and I think they're exciting,'' said Mr. Havens, who toured the eight-story structure with dozens of developers, brokers and curiosity seekers. ''It's dramatic, and you imagine what could happen in a building that size. The problem is it's not worth anything, and one of the big brokers who was there that day actually said that it's worth 'less than zero.' ''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since issuing a request for proposals in December, the development corporation has received bids of $500,000 to $10 million from six potential buyers. Each has offered different ways to hurdle financial obstacles that include the building's enormous renovation costs, a wide floor plate that limits light and air at the center of the structure, zoning limitations, and property taxes of $1 million a year, which the federal government is exempt from paying.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An earlier effort by the federal government to sell the building, in 2006, was derailed two years later after the winning bidder, Time Equities, pulled away in the face of economic turmoil. The group, which invested $1.5 million in engineering and architectural fees before abandoning its plans, did not submit a follow-up proposal, said the company's chairman, Francis Greenburger.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Our reading of the market hasn't really changed,'' Mr. Greenburger said, ''and we just feel like it would not be appropriate for us to get back in when we didn't have the conditions we need to move forward. Time Equities' original proposal included the possibility of bringing a Target store to the site in addition to industrial tenants. ''Our experience in the market today is there's little construction financing available and, certainly for larger projects, it's almost nonexistent,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But successful development of buildings like Federal No. 2 could help stem an exodus of industrial jobs in the city, which have fallen to about 100,000 in 2008, from a peak of 960,000 in 1959, according to the federal Labor Department. The recent rezoning of 50 blocks in Greenpoint and Williamsburg to residential from industrial left hundreds of businesses without a home in the city, said Leah Archibald of Ewvidco, a north Brooklyn business advocacy group.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''There are a lot of displaced industrial tenants right now,'' said Nick Halstead, a project manager for the Economic Development Corporation, which is overseeing a multifaceted plan for Sunset Park that includes a new freight rail line. ''Space gets expensive in certain submarkets so we're trying to hold this down as one big area for affordable industrial use.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Broadening the building's appeal for prospective tenants has been a central challenge for the Clarett Group and Industry City Associates, two of the developers that submitted bids late last month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bruce Federman, a partner at Industry City, said that altering the concept of light manufacturing to include technology start-ups and art studios was needed to generate demand for a space that few expect will command more than $8 a square foot. Under the Industry City proposal, only 25 percent of the building would be immediately leased, and the remaining space would be marketed after further renovations -- including larger windows to allow for more air and light, a new roof and the installation of up to 16 new elevator cars.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It's not what we used to know from the modern era of garment distribution,'' Mr. Federman said of light manufacturing. ''It has to include crafts, artisans, creative commercial users, graphic artists and computer users who use space in a manner not commonly fit into manufacturing.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The building was erected quickly during World War I as a Navy warehouse and later used as a uniform depot during World War II, according to city records. Before being shuttered in 2000, it housed Food and Drug Administration laboratories and a New York Police Department gang unit, among other government agencies. A few relics from before the building closed, like a photo of a young Bill Clinton and a 1988 Mets poster, are still tacked to the walls.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Initially, speculation that the building would be rezoned for residential use, as happened in former industrial sites in Williamsburg, drew intense interest from a handful of developers, said Yossi Hackner, managing director for Sholom &amp;Zuckerbrot Realty in Queens. Those potential buyers fell by the wayside, however, after city officials renewed their vows to maintain the area's M3-1 zoning, a narrow designation that allows for woodworkers, food and beverage distributors and medical supply companies, among other groups.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Josh Keller, executive director of the Southwest Brooklyn Industrial Development Corporation, said Sunset Park's large population of Mexican and Asian immigrants were in need of jobs, not homes. According to his advocacy group's research there were some 2,000 industrial businesses in Sunset Park and the nearby areas of Gowanus and Red Hook in 2005.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Believe me, employment isn't what it could be because of the circumstances nationally, and in New York, with its relatively high unemployment rate,'' Mr. Keller said. ''So if you ask me what we need right now, it's employment and getting people back to work.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Housing prices are still inching up, but few analysts are presuming the trend will last.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span> Case-Shiller Index rose a seasonally adjusted 0.3 percent in January, from December, according to data released Tuesday. It was the eighth consecutive monthly increase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But what appeared to be good news in the widely watched measure masked underlying troubles. The discrepancy is because of seasonal adjustments, which in theory smooth out the data. In the slow-selling winter months, seasonal adjustments lift the numbers; in the summer, the opposite happens.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On an unadjusted basis, the index fell 0.4 percent in January from December, extending a pattern of decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We're seeing a general weakening,'' said Maureen Maitland, vice president for index services at <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span>.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">House sales rose in the fall as buyers and sellers eagerly did deals before the government's $8,000 tax credit was scheduled to end Nov. 30. Congress then extended the credit until April 30, but the momentum was lost, and sales volume plunged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other housing indexes, which use different sets of data from different communities, show that the last few months have been hard on home prices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The First American CoreLogic Home Price Index dropped 1.9 percent in January, double its decline in December. The <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span>'s index dropped 0.6 percent in January after falling a revised 2 percent in December. Analysts said that Case-Shiller would eventually slide as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''It is only a matter of time before the index records a double-dip in prices,'' Paul Dales of Capital Economics said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the meantime, the spread between the raw numbers and the adjusted numbers is getting wider. Cleveland, for instance, rose 0.7 percent on an adjusted basis in January. But the raw numbers showed a 0.7 percent decline.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''In a normal market, seasonal patterns are the same every year,'' said Ms. Maitland of S.&amp;P. ''In a stressed market with a lot of foreclosures, that predictability is being lost.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The housing market bottomed last winter. On an annual basis, the Case-Shiller index is now off less than 1 percent. Prices are down about 30 percent from the peak in the summer of 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Twelve of the cities in the index went up in January from December. The West Coast continued to show a pattern of strength, despite the fact that its cities are generally more expensive and therefore the influence of the government tax credit was presumably less.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Los Angeles was the biggest gainer, up 1.7 percent. San Diego was up 0.9 percent and San Francisco rose 0.6 percent. Chicago was the biggest loser, dropping 0.8 percent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the January 2010 data now published, it is possible to track the best and worst cities to have owned real estate over the century's first decade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three best cities are no surprise: Los Angeles, New York and Washington. All are more than 70 percent above their level in January 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anyone who bought in Las Vegas would have lost a few dollars after paying their agent's commission. But the worst-performing city in the index was Detroit, which ended the decade 28 percent below where it began.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DES MOINES -- Nine hundred days after putting their house on the market, Andrew and Jane Palestini were beginning to think they might be stuck in Iowa forever.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The looming expiration of the government's housing tax credit pushed them into action. They dropped their price by an additional $10,000, to $235,000. Somewhat to their shock, a buyer emerged. The house is now under contract.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''I can't feel happy,'' said Mr. Palestini, a retired administrative law judge with the Social Security Administration. ''Just relieved.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After several disastrous months for home sales across the country, when volume dropped by 23 percent, the pace appears to be picking up again. The number of Des Moines homes under contract in February rose by a third from the January level. The number of pending contracts jumped 10 percent in Naples, Fla., 14 percent in Houston and 21 percent in Portland, Ore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These deals will be reflected in the national sales reports when they become final, this month or next. There is no evidence that prices have begun to move in response to the higher volume. Indeed, so many homes are coming on the market that prices might well fall further.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Real estate agents say buyers and sellers are hurrying to take advantage of the tax credit, which is worth up to $8,000 for home buyers. But the last-minute rush is also prompting some foreboding about what will happen to the market on April 30 when the credit ends -- and whether it is too risky to let it end at all.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James M. Poterba, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, calls this ''the exit strategy problem.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If you have a short-run program to stimulate demand, it's always tricky to figure out how you gently remove it without going off a precipice,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Arguments for extending the tax credit a second time are just beginning. Robert Shiller, a professor of economics at Yale and co-developer of the <span class="companylink">Standard &amp;Poor's</span>/Case-Shiller housing price index, is an early advocate. He thinks the credit was a bad idea that nevertheless the market cannot do without.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You don't make drug addicts go cold turkey,'' Mr. Shiller said. ''The credit interferes with the market in an arbitrary way, but ending it now would be psychologically powerful. People will be in a bad mood about buying a house.'' He advocates phasing it out gradually.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some states, worries about the housing market are trumping fiscal considerations. They are adopting or extending tax credits or other supportive measures in hopes of bringing the market to life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">California last week renewed a $10,000 credit that proved popular last year, allocating $200 million for it despite a state budget crisis. New Jersey legislators just introduced a bill that would give buyers a $15,000 credit spread over three years. South Carolina recently announced a $7,000 down payment assistance program for teachers, police officers and firefighters.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As it has been for several years, housing remains the most coddled and the most troubled sector of the economy. Outside the realm of real estate, many of the government banking programs created to deal with the crisis have ended, and credit markets have largely returned to normal. On March 8, the Federal Reserve held its final auction in a two-year-old program that offered banks emergency short-term loans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few days earlier, however, government regulators extended a refinancing program for homeowners whose properties had plunged in value. Originally due to expire in June, the program has been renewed to the middle of 2011 ''to support and promote market stability,'' the <span class="companylink">Federal Housing Finance Agency</span> said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, just three days after substantially expanding its antiforeclosure programs, the Obama administration announced another $600 million to finance innovative measures to help defaulting families in five hard-hit states: North Carolina, Oregon, Ohio, Rhode Island and South Carolina. The first round of financing, announced last month, provided $1.5 billion to states including California and Florida.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Supported by an array of government programs aimed at both reducing foreclosures and encouraging traditional sales, housing was supposed to be on the road to a solid recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An earlier version of the tax credit created a rush to buy in the fall, when people thought it would expire Nov. 30. The housing industry argued that sales would fall off a cliff if the credit were not extended and broadened, so Congress went along.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stan Humphries, the executive in charge of data and analytics at the housing site <span class="companylink">Zillow.com</span>, said government support was crucial in breaking housing's acute fall in 2007 and 2008, but that it had also obscured the actual weakness of the market.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Many people got the sense last year that we had bottomed out and were going to rebound in a V-shaped recovery,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, the sales volume of existing homes declined in December more steeply than in any month in the four decades that such numbers have been tracked. Sales dropped again in January and February. Meanwhile, the sales volume of new homes fell in January to the lowest level since record-keeping began in 1963, a record broken again in February.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Buyers who want the tax credit must sign a deal by April 30 but would have until June 30 to close. Consequently, if sales volume is going to plunge after the credit expires, it will not show up until the numbers for July are reported. While Mr. Humphries says he does not expect sales that month to fall by December's record rate, he predicts a long period of merely ''dragging along the bottom,'' with prices to match.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was just what the Palestinis were worried about.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If they did not sell by April 30, they anticipated having to lower their price yet again, to compensate any buyer for the credit he would no longer get. It also meant they would not get a credit themselves on buying a new home in Philadelphia, pushing down what they could afford to pay.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has been an unexpected ordeal. The Palestinis bought their spacious ranch house in the Des Moines suburb of Clive for $185,000 in 1995, after looking for only three days. ''My feeling was it would never be a problem selling,'' said Jane Palestini, a retired specialist in adoptions from China. ''Ha, ha, ha.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In early 2007, the house across the street sold in three days, but the Palestinis spent the summer getting their place ready. By the time they put it on the market that September for $265,000, prices were falling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For months, they lived in a state of readiness for prospective buyers. To minimize clutter, they carted off many of their possessions to self-storage. They bought new pillows and kept them mounded on the beds. They bought fresh flowers and baked hundreds of cookies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The months became years. They know their mistake: They should have kept cutting the price until they sold. But every dollar they dropped their price was one dollar less for a down payment in Philadelphia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their house is under contract for $225,000. After paying the agent's commission and subtracting the cost of remodeling the kitchen, the Palestinis are at best breaking even. ''You just have to ignore how much it's going to hurt,'' Mr. Palestini said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At least they have escaped whatever trouble is to come this summer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their agent, Jim Heldenbrand, told them he hoped the credit would ''get the momentum going.'' But he also mentioned the plans of a colleague in real estate: As soon as the credit expires, the man plans to get on his Harley and just keep riding south.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HEMET, Calif. -- By the time four city trucks were set ablaze next to Hemet City Hall last week, the police here had become familiar with their new life under siege.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The arson was the most recent episode during four months of threats of violence and attempted attacks against peace officers in the city that officials say are reprisals for crackdowns on local motorcycle gangs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now this city of tract homes and trailer parks in Riverside County, about 80 miles east of Los Angeles, is on edge, with barricades and an iron fence going up around the Police Department downtown, ''to prevent someone from lobbing a grenade or something in the window,'' Police Chief Richard Dana said in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We go around with a target painted on our backs,'' Chief Dana said Friday. ''Now, an officer walks out from roll call, then gets on his knees to look under his car and see that there's no bomb there.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Hemet Police Department, the state attorney general's office and federal agencies have raised a $200,000 reward for any information leading to an arrest and conviction in the attacks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trouble started for Hemet officials shortly after a gang task force began ''putting pressure'' on the Vagos motorcycle gang late last year by checking members for potential parole violations, said John Hall, a spokesman for the district attorney's office. ''This group has parole violators and violent people,'' he said. ''There's a history of bar fights, identity theft, drug sales.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Dec. 31, someone used plastic tubing to reroute a natural gas pipeline to spew fumes into the headquarters of the county's gang task force unit in Hemet, Chief Dana said. Two officers entered the building, but smelled fumes and decided not to flip a light switch that might have ignited the building.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Feb. 23, someone hooked a homemade gun to a gate outside the same building, rigging it to fire. One bullet whizzed past the head of an officer who tried to enter, missing him because the gate did not open fully.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the morning of March 5, a crude pipe bomb was found strapped beneath an unmarked police car used by task force members as it sat parked outside a convenience store.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just before sunrise on March 17, officers from local, state and federal agencies conducted a raid on Vagos members suspected of parole violations. Days later, a 911 caller threatened to blow up a patrol car within 48 hours ''in retaliation for the raid,'' Mr. Hall said. No attack took place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January, the Hemet police said that they suspected members of Vagos, the largest motorcycle gang in the state, with 600 members, as being behind the gas line booby trap, but Chief Dana said that the investigation in that case had expanded to other groups as well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Riverside County District Attorney's office continued to focus on Vagos as a group with potential ties to the attacks, Mr. Hall said Friday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''The Vagos are a typical violent gang,'' he said. ''Vagos is a gang we've put pressure on. This was targeting gang task force members. Vagos has a history of trying to infiltrate and affect law enforcement operations.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pat Palafox, the Vagos president, said there was ''no connection between Vagos and any attacks.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said those arrested during the March 17 raid ''weren't current members of the club.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Vagos is a brotherhood,'' said Mr. Palafox, 47. ''We support each other. Like any organization, there are people off the grid. But Vagos get harassed by police more than any other motorcycle clubs, or any gangs around here.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The city of Hemet is about 27 square miles of flat streets and low buildings near the base of the San Jacinto Mountains, where land abutting the yellow hills is cheap compared with Los Angeles and San Diego.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''That brought young families,'' Chief Dana said, ''but it also drew people wanting to take advantage.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A housing boom in the last decade nearly doubled the population to more than 100,000, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gang task force -- an amalgam of the local police, sheriff's deputies and state and federal agencies -- has used parole sweeps to monitor the county's mix of white supremacist groups and street and motorcycle gangs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''Clearly, we irritated somebody somewhere along the line,'' Chief Dana said. ''However, I would've done it anyway. I don't like gang members. I don't like them making people scared to go to the store.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doua Moua, 23, played a menacing gangster in a Clint Eastwood movie, but Mr. Moua swears he really is a nice, gentle and rules-abiding fellow. At least he was until he moved to New York City and unwittingly slipped into a world of lawlessness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Moua lives with five roommates. And in New York, home to some of the nation's highest rents and more than eight million people, many of them single, it is illegal for more than three unrelated people to live in an apartment or a house.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The law, for decades part of the city's Housing Maintenance Code, is little known, widely broken and infrequently enforced. Three citations have been issued since July, according to the Department of Housing Preservation and Development.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the law is enforced, it is usually because of a complaint from a neighbor or because inspectors spotted a violation while responding to a maintenance problem. The violation is rarely written up unless it is accompanied by a host of others. Rarer still are the tenants who call up the city to turn in their landlord.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lax enforcement might not be a bad thing, since a sizable number of the city's denizens, especially its penny-pinched younger residents, have found living with more than two others a financial necessity. According to the Census Bureau's 2008 American Community Survey, nearly 15,000 dwellings in the city housed three or more roommates who were unrelated to the head of the household. Experts say that number is almost certainly underreported.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''To pack unrelated people in an apartment? I don't think it's wrong,'' said Mr. Moua, who moved to the city from Minnesota in 2005. ''It's part of New York City culture.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Moua, who played Spider, a bandana-clad villain in ''Gran Torino,'' never thought twice about moving into the immaculately renovated four-bedroom apartment in Hamilton Heights that half a dozen people call home. The place is lined with track lighting and has two bathrooms. His room costs $850 a month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first, four people lived in the apartment, but then a roommate's girlfriend moved in, along with a friend of Mr. Moua's, who sleeps on a couch in his room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the roommates, David Everett, who is 21 and pays $750 a month, said the law made no sense. ''Everything is overpriced,'' Mr. Everett said. ''To find an apartment that is good housing with few roommates is not going to happen.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other cities have similar laws, often spottily enforced. In New Orleans, it is illegal for more than four unrelated adults to live together, though the city's safety and permits director said that only about five violations were issued a year. In Boston, a 2008 law passed in response to complaints about overcrowding and garbage says that no more than four college undergraduates may live together. Amherst, Mass., which has a sizable college population, also draws the line at four people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York, student dormitories and group homes are exempt from the law. But illegal arrangements can be found across the five boroughs, and they cross lines of age, class, race and dress. They include young actors and ponytailed post-graduates; rising and falling junior investment bankers; immigrants, legal and illegal; and trend-obsessed residents in Brooklyn neighborhoods.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is a city, after all, where people are willing to do just about anything to pay cheap rent. Among recent <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span> offerings: a windowless cubby in Williamsburg, alternately described as a ''torture chamber'' and a ''unique dungeon,'' for $525, and half of an East Village bunk bed, for $550.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jordan Dann and her three roommates live in an airy six-bedroom town house -- two bedrooms are empty -- in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Dann, who is 33 and works in the theater arts, shares the house with Michelle McGowan, 32, a high school history teacher; Anya Kogan, 27, a Web designer; and Nick Turner, 29, who works in Web sales and marketing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All four said they could not have afforded the neighborhood or similarly appointed rooms if they had fewer roommates. The house borders a park and has hardwood floors and deep-set windows. Each room rents for $1,200. The roommates say they are respectful and do not let anything molder too long in the fridge.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, to Mr. Turner's endless gratitude, the house has three bathrooms. ''I'd go crazy otherwise,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of the roommates had heard of the law, but learning about it elicited little angst.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''You're not going to be the one getting in trouble,'' Mr. Turner said. ''The landlord is.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was right. But enforcement is complicated, housing officials said, by the difficulty of finding violators. Inspectors cannot go door to door searching for violations in a city of more than three million households. The law does not specify a penalty, but a landlord who is cited usually must evict the extra tenants.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eric Bederman, a spokesman for the housing department, said the code was devised for residents' safety. People with multiple roommates might put locks on their doors or erect barriers, he said, making rescue or escape attempts during emergencies hazardous, even deadly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Jerilyn Perine, a former city housing commissioner, said the roommates rule came about to address another concern. It dates to the 1950s, she said, when the city balked at the number of sketchy single-room-occupancy buildings and their often equally sketchy inhabitants, and wanted boarding house brownstones to be converted back to family homes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Perine, the executive director of the nonprofit Citizens Housing and Planning Council, said the law, which can be amended only by the City Council, should be changed. It puts people living in such accommodations at risk, she said, by driving this type of occupancy underground. Often, not every roommate is on the lease. Fire regulations might be ignored.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Perine said occupancy laws should be determined not by whether people were related, but by whether a unit was safely inhabited, whether by four people or more.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sarah Watson, a policy analyst who works with Ms. Perine, said the law had another unintended effect. It put a crimp on innovative construction that might otherwise house larger numbers of single adults, she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Moua's landlord, who did not want his name published for fear of a crackdown, said he wrestled with converting some of his apartments into four-bedroom units. He knew it was illegal to allow four unrelated people to live together, but decided that if tenants were willing to live in what was once a dining room, it was fine with him. He could collect slightly more in rent over all and charge less for each room.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''If it's done in a good way, and there's not unlimited cramming in, and the shared facilities are adequate,'' the landlord said, ''then it actually helps solve the affordable housing problem, which I think is a good thing.''</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WHAT do Alex Rodriguez, the highest-paid player in baseball, and Henry Silverman, the billionaire who founded the <span class="companylink">Cendant Corporation</span>, have in common? Besides piles of money, they share a landlord -- Leroy Schecter, the 82-year-old steel magnate who owns the apartments they rent at 15 Central Park West.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their spaces could be rehabbed to become the most expensive apartment in New York City.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Schecter had initially planned to combine the apartments for himself, but then decided he would rather live in his 25,000-square-foot house in Indian Creek, Fla., than brave New York City winters. So he rented the two-bedroom to Mr. Rodriguez for $30,000 a month and the three-bedroom next door to Mr. Silverman for $40,000 a month. But although they both just renewed their leases for another year, Mr. Schecter has decided to put the apartments on the market for $55 million.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He will sell them only as a pair, and if he gets even close to his asking price, he will very likely score the most expensive condo sale on record in New York City. His broker, Emily Beare, an executive vice president of Core Group Marketing, said Mr. Schecter would be happy to show potential buyers architectural plans already approved by the building for combining the apartments. The plans would create a 5,600-square-foot space with three bedrooms, a reception room, a library, a dining room, a breakfast room, a family room and a theater. In 2008 Mr. Schecter paid $18 million for the three-bedroom and $8.5 million for the two-bedroom.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">''We felt the whole was worth more than the parts,'' Ms. Beare said, noting that the combined apartment would probably become the biggest one at 15 Central Park West. ''We were going to wait until next year, but there's a real pulse in the market right now. Inventory is very limited and this is very special.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Schecter is the chairman of Marino/WARE Industries, a manufacturer of steel construction materials. He is developing a 22,000-square-foot house with a steel structure near his current Florida home and that of his neighbor, the singer Julio Iglesias.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Rodriguez's next place of residence is not yet known. But Mr. Silverman -- whose conglomerate owned businesses like Century 21 Real Estate, Avis, Days Inn and Orbitz -- recently bought an Upper West Side town house last listed at $19.5 million.</p>
